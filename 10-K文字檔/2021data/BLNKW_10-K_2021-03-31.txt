ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”
At Blink Charging, our highest priority remains the safety, health and well-being of our employees, their families and our communities and we remain committed to serving the needs of our customers. The Covid-19 pandemic presents uncertain business challenges and it is not currently possible for us to reasonably estimate the impact it may have on our financial and operating results. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our business as we learn more and the impact of Covid-19 on our industry becomes clearer.
Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences, as well as our inability to avail ourselves of the loan forgiveness provisions of the PPP Loan, could materially affect our results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Except as required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.
Overview
We are a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (“EV”) charging equipment and networked EV charging services. Blink offers residential and commercial EV charging equipment, enabling EV drivers to recharge at various location types. Blink’s principal line of products and services is its Blink EV charging network (the “Blink Network”) and Blink EV charging equipment, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (“EVSE”) and other EV-related services. The Blink Network is a proprietary, cloud-based system that operates, maintains, and manages Blink charging stations and handles the associated charging data, back-end operations, and payment processing. The Blink Network provides property owners, managers, parking companies, and state and municipal entities (“Property Partners”) with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations. The Blink Network also provides EV drivers with vital station information, including station location, availability, and any fees (if applicable).
Blink offers Property Partners a range of business models for EV charging equipment and services that generally fall into one of the business models below, differentiated by who bears the costs of installation, equipment, maintenance, and the percentage of revenue shared (as applicable).
● In our Blink-owned turnkey business model, Blink incurs the costs of the charging equipment and installation. We own and operate the EV charging station and provide connectivity of the charging station to the Blink Network. In this model, Blink incurs most costs associated with the EV charging stations; thus, Blink retains substantially all EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees.
● In our Blink-owned hybrid business model, Blink incurs the costs of the charging equipment while the Property Partner incurs the costs of installation costs. We own and operate the EV charging station and provide connectivity of the charging station to the Blink Network. In this model, the Property Partner incurs the installation costs associated with the EV station; thus, Blink shares a more generous portion of the EV charging revenues with the Property Partner generated from the EV charging station after deducting network connectivity and processing fee.
● In our host-owned business model, the Property Partner purchases, owns and operates the Blink EV charging station and incurs the installation costs. Blink works with the Property Partner, providing site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Network, payment processing, and optional maintenance services. In this model, the Property Partner retains and keeps all the EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees.
● In our Blink-as-a-service model, Blink owns and operates the EV charging station, while the Property Partner incurs the installation cost. The Property Partner pays to Blink a fixed monthly fee and keeps all the EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees.
We are dedicated to slowing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by transportation. We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal sites, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations.
As of December 31, 2020, we sold or deployed 16,617 charging stations, of which 7,062 were on the Blink Network (4,348 Level 2 publicly accessible commercial charging units, 1,404 Level 2 private commercial charging units, 120 DC Fast Charging EV publicly accessible chargers, 14 DC Fast Charging EV private chargers, and 1,176 residential Level 2 Blink EV charging units), and the remainder were non-networked, on other networks or international sales or deployments (228 Level 2 commercial charging units, 8,773 residential Level 2 Blink EV charging stations, 521 sold internationally and 33 deployed internationally).
As reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020, we had a cash balance of $22,341,433, working capital of $19,579,775 and an accumulated deficit of $187,351,448. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $17,846,467 and $9,648,500, respectively. We have not yet achieved profitability.
Recent Developments
January 2021 Underwritten Public Offering
In January 2021, we completed an underwritten registered public offering of 5,660,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $41.00 per share. We received approximately $232.1 million in gross proceeds from the public offering, and approximately $221.5 million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses paid by us. Our Chief Executive Officer and one other officer participated in the offering by selling a total of 550,000 shares of our common stock from the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares. The public offering was made pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on January 6, 2021 and prospectus supplement dated January 7, 2021. Barclays Capital Inc. served as the lead book-running manager of the offering.
November 2020 U-Go Charging Acquisition and DCFC Portfolio
In November 2020, we acquired the EV charging operator U- Go Stations, Inc. (“U-Go”) and its portfolio of 44 DCFC (direct-current fast charger) charging locations. The purchase also included multiple grants awarded to U-Go for the deployment of up to an additional 45 new charging stations. The charging stations are located primarily at hotels, gas stations and auto dealerships, expanding our DCFC footprint across ten states including Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Vermont. The consideration under the terms of the acquisition agreement to U- Go’s stockholders consisted of the issuance of shares of our common stock at closing, a future cash payment based on the fulfillment of pending projects post-closing and the assumption of scheduled liabilities.
September 2020 BlueLA Carsharing Acquisition
In September 2020, in order to expand our market presence in California, we acquired through our wholly-owned subsidiary Blink Mobility, LLC all of the ownership interests of BlueLA Carsharing, LLC (“BlueLA”), the City of Los Angeles’ contractor for its EV carsharing services program, from Blue Systems USA, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of an Ownership Interest Purchase Agreement, we assumed control of BlueLA’s existing infrastructure throughout Los Angeles of EV charging stations, which we have since upgraded to our own IQ 200 charging stations.
At-the-Market Offering Program
In April 2020, we entered into a sales agreement to conduct a $20.0 million “at-the-market” (ATM) equity offering program, pursuant to which we sold shares of our common stock at such times as we determined through transactions on the Nasdaq Capital Market at prevailing market prices. As of December 31, 2020, we sold 3,587,833 shares of common stock under the ATM program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $20 million.
Note on Covid-19
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted global stock markets and economies. We continue to closely monitor the impact the impact of the outbreak of the coronavirus (“Covid-19”). We have taken precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and business partners, while assuring business continuity and reliable service and support to our customers. We continue to receive orders for our products, although some shipments of equipment have been temporarily delayed. We have experienced what we expect is a temporary reduction in the usage of our charging stations, which has resulted in a decrease in our charging service revenue. As federal, state and local economies begin to reopen and with a vaccine underway we expect demand for charging station usage to return, but we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact. We intend to continue to monitor the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on our business closely.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenues
Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6,230,231 compared to $2,759,190 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $3,471,041, or 126%.
Charging service revenue for company-owned and operated charging stations was $772,540 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,359,218 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $586,678, or 43%. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in usage of charging stations as a result of COVID-19.
Revenue from product sales was $4,432,423 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $856,243 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $3,576,180, or 418%. This increase was attributable to increased sales of Generation 2 chargers, DC fast chargers and residential chargers when compared to the same period in 2019.
Network fee revenue was $344,819 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $301,627 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $43,192, or 14%. The increase was attributable to an increase in the billings and invoicing to Property Partners in 2020 compared to 2019.
Warranty revenue was $129,109 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $52,996 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $76,113, or 144%. The increase was primarily attributable to a increase in warranty contracts sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Grant and rebate revenues were $21,558 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $22,396 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $838, or 4%. Grant and rebates relating to equipment and the related installation are deferred and amortized in a manner consistent with the depreciation expense of the related assets over their useful lives. The ability to secure grant revenue is typically unpredictable and, therefore, uncertain. The 2020 revenue was related to the amortization of previous years’ grants.
Other revenue increased by $363,072 to $529,782 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $166,710 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits generated during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We generate these credits from the electricity utilized by our electric car charging stations as a byproduct from our charging services in the states of California and Oregon. The value of the credits is subject to market conditions and our current policy is to sell the credits generated during the current year. Furthermore, included in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was rideshare revenues of $168,824 related to the 2020 acquisition of BlueLA.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues primarily consists of electricity reimbursements, revenue share payments to our Property Partner hosts, the cost of charging stations sold (including commissions), connectivity charges provided by telco and other networks, warranty, repairs and maintenance services, and depreciation of our installed charging stations.
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,713,921, compared to $2,366,779 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2,347,142 or 99%. There is a degree of variability in our costs in relation to our revenues from period to period, primarily due to:
● electricity reimbursements that are unique to those Property Partner host agreements which provide for such reimbursements;
● revenue share payments are predicated on the contractual obligation under the property partner agreement and the revenue generated by the applicable chargers;
● cost of charging stations sold is predicated on the mix of types of charging stations and parts sold during the period;
● network costs are fixed in nature based on the number of chargers connected to the telco network regardless of whether the charger generates revenue;
● provisions for excess and obsolete inventory; and
● warranty and repairs and maintenance expenses are based on both the number of service cases completed during the period.
Cost of charging services for company-owned charging stations (electricity reimbursements) increased by $245,898, or 162%, to $397,377 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $151,479 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in 2020 was attributable to the mix of charging stations generating charging service revenues subject to electricity reimbursement.
Host provider fees decreased by $154,803, or 37%, to $265,272 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $420,075 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was a result of the mix of chargers generating revenue and their corresponding revenue share percentage payments to Property Partner hosts pursuant to their agreements, as well as a reduction in utilization due to COVID-19.
Cost of product sales increased by $1,898,367, or 198%, to $2,859,559 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $961,192 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in product sales of Generation 2, DC fast chargers and home residential chargers during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Furthermore, full year 2020 included a reduction in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $392,191 relating to the increased sales of residential home charger units. The year ended December 31, 2019 included a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $437,068 relating to non-Generation 2 inventory that was not being sold/utilized.
Network costs increased by $260,614, or 102%, to $515,953 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $255,339 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was a result of the increase in charging stations on our network and costs incurred related to the upgrading of our network system as compared to the same period in 2019.
Warranty and repairs and maintenance costs decreased by $120,023, or 27%, to $330,742 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $450,765 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to significant efforts expended in previous periods to reduce the backlog in warranty cases.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $217,089, or 170%, to $345,018 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $127,929 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was a result of increased number of EV charging stations included in property and equipment.
Operating Expenses
Compensation expense increased by $5,967,531, or 88%, from $6,750,753 (consisting of approximately $6.0 million of cash compensation and approximately $0.7 million of non-cash compensation) for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $12,718,284 (consisting of approximately $11.7 million of cash compensation and approximately $1.0 million of non-cash compensation) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to increases in personnel and compensation in executive, marketing, sales and operations departments as a result of the anticipated growth of the Company. In addition, compensation expense during full year 2020 compared to full year 2019 increased due to additional personnel in conjunction with the acquisitions of BlueLA and U-Go made during 2020. Also contributing to the increase in compensation expense was $2.3 million related the gross-up cash payment to our non-employee directors pursuant to the 2017 Board Plan as a result of the vesting on November 23, 2020 of the annual award to our non-employee directors granted on December 12, 2019 and March 19, 2020 (see Note 13).
General and administrative expenses increased by $2,130,308, or 111%, from $1,916,817 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4,047,125 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in audit, legal, investor relations, marketing and consulting expenditures of $1,267,791. Also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses were expenditures of $379,182 related to the 2020 acquisitions of BlueLA and U-Go.
Other operating expenses increased by $368,741, or 17%, from $2,196,784 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2,565,525 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in insurance, software licensing, rent, and use tax expenditures of $575,567. The increase was partially offset by reductions in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income decreased by $855,286 from $823,443 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $(31,843) for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we settled accounts payable resulting in a gain of $273,667 and $383,158 of notes payable, inclusive of accrued interest to the former members of 350 Green in exchange for the cancellation of the notes, the return of 8,066 of our common shares and the payment of $73,158, in 2018, to the former members of 350 Green, resulting in a gain of $310,000. Additionally, we realized net investment income from our cash and marketable securities portfolio of $240,000, and an increase in market value of Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits of $21,000.
Net Loss
Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $8,197,967, or 85%, to $17,846,467 as compared to $9,648,500 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense and general and administrative expenses.
Total Comprehensive (Loss) Income
Our total comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $18,029,640 whereas our total comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $9,465,327.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we financed our activities from proceeds derived from debt and equity financings occurring in prior periods. A significant portion of the funds raised from the sale of capital stock has been used to cover working capital needs and personnel, office expenses and various consulting and professional fees.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we used cash of $18,069,954 and $10,764,813, respectively, in operations. Our cash used for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $17,846,467, reduced by net non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $1,589,655, and by $1,813,142 of net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. Our cash used for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $9,648,500, reduced by net non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $1,290,308, and by $2,406,621 of net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $260,240, of which $2,773,816 was provided in connection with the sale of marketable securities and $2,547,220 was used to purchase charging stations and other fixed assets. $1 was used as purchase consideration in connection with the BlueLA acquisition and, in connection with the business combination, the Company acquired $3,379 of cash. Additionally, the Company acquired $30,266 of cash in connection with the U-Go Stations, Inc acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $552,820, which was used to purchase charging stations and other fixed assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $36,058,709, of which $855,666 was attributable to proceeds from our PPP loan, $19,175,546 was attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our ATM program and $16,264,687 was attributable to the net proceeds from warrant exercises, partially offset by $72,190 used to pay down our liability in connection with internal use software and $165,000 used to repay notes payable. During the years ended December 31, 2019 cash used in financing activities was $52,379 which was used to pay down our liability in connection with internal use software.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, working capital and an accumulated deficit of $22,341,433, $19,579,775 and $187,351,448, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $17,846,467.
In January 2021, we completed an underwritten registered public offering of 5,660,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $41.00 per share. We received approximately $232.1 million in gross proceeds from the public offering, and approximately $221.5 million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses paid by us. The public offering was made pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on January 6, 2021 and prospectus supplement dated January 7, 2021.
We are using the net proceeds from the public offering to supplement our operating cash flows to fund EV charging station deployment and finance the costs of acquiring competitive and complementary businesses, products and technologies as a part of our growth strategy, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.
We have not yet achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that our operating expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will eventually need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability. Historically, we have been able to raise funds to support our business operations, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising significant additional funds in the future. We expect that our cash on hand will fund our operations for at least 12 months after from the issuance date of the financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Since inception, our operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received in equity and debt financings. We believe we have access to capital resources and continue to evaluate additional financing opportunities. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds we might raise will enable us to complete our development initiatives or attain profitable operations.
Our operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which it relies are reasonably based upon information available to us at the time that it makes these estimates and judgments. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described below.
The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue primarily from five different types of contracts:
● Charging service revenue - company-owned charging stations - Revenue is recognized at the point when a particular charging session is completed.
● Product sales - Revenue is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation, which generally is at the time it ships the product to the customer.
● Network fees and other - Represents a stand-ready obligation whereby we are obligated to perform over a period of time and, as a result, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Network fees are billed annually.
● Other Primarily related to charging service revenue from non-company-owned charging stations. Revenue is recognized from non-company-owned charging stations at the point when a particular charging session is completed in accordance with a contractual relationship between us and the owner of the station. Other revenues are also comprised of sales related to alternative fuel credits.
The timing of the Company’s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. A receivable is recorded when revenue is recognized prior to payment and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied.
Grants, rebates and alternative fuel credits, which are not within the scope of ASC 606, pertaining to revenues and periodic expenses are recognized as income when the related revenue and/or periodic expense are recorded. Grants and rebates related to EV charging stations and their installation are deferred and amortized in a manner consistent with the related depreciation expense of the related asset over their useful lives over the useful life of the charging station.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value amount of the shares expected to ultimately vest is then recognized over the period for which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. The estimation of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from original estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets by monitoring current selling prices of car charging units in the open market, the adoption rate of various auto manufacturers in the EV market and projected car charging utilization at various public car charging stations throughout its network in determining fair value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
Operating Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities” (SPEs).
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Our recently issued accounting standards are included in Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
