Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the consolidated financial statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction therewith. The detailed discussion in the sections below focuses on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 2019, and the financial condition as of December 31, 2020 compared to the financial condition as of December 31, 2019.
As described in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we have two reportable segments: community banking and mortgage banking. The community banking segment provides consumer and business banking products and services to customers. Consumer products include loan products, deposit products, and personal investment services. Business banking products include loans for working capital, inventory and general corporate use, commercial real estate construction loans, and deposit accounts. The mortgage banking segment, which is conducted through Waterstone Mortgage Corporation, consists of originating residential mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary market.
Our community banking segment generates the significant majority of our consolidated net interest income and requires the significant majority of our provision for loan losses. Our mortgage banking segment generates the significant majority of our noninterest income and a majority of our noninterest expenses. We have provided below a discussion of the material results of operations for each segment on a separate basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared the year ended December 31, 2019, which focuses on noninterest income and noninterest expenses. We have also provided a discussion of the consolidated operations of Waterstone Financial, which includes the consolidated operations of WaterStone Bank and Waterstone Mortgage Corporation, for the same periods.
For a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, see “Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” Discussion of Results of Operations included in our 2019 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 13, 2020.
Significant Items
Earnings comparisons among the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were impacted by the Significant Items summarized below.
COVID-19 and the CARES Act
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused economic and social disruption on an unprecedented scale. While some industries have been impacted more severely than others, all businesses have been impacted to some degree. This disruption has resulted in the shuttering of businesses across the country, significant job loss, and aggressive measures by the federal government.
Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions designed to cushion the economic fallout. Most notably, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law at the end of March 2020 as a $2 trillion legislative package. The goal of the CARES Act is to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures, including direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors. The package also includes extensive emergency funding for hospitals and providers. In addition to the general impact of COVID-19, certain provisions of the CARES Act as well as other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts are expected to have a material impact on our operations. While it is not possible to know the full universe or extent of these impacts as of the date this filing, we are disclosing potentially material items of which we are aware.
•
The CARES Act allows for a temporary delay in the adoption of accounting guidance under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“CECL”) until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, pursuant to the recently-enacted CARES Act and guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), we elected to delay adoption of CECL. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. Among other provisions, this Act extended the temporary delay on the adoption of CECL until January 1, 2022. The December 31, 2020 financial statements include an allowance for loan losses that was prepared under the existing incurred loss methodology.
•
Under the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and COVID-19 impacted loans which involved principal deferrals or principal and interest deferrals are considered current. A financial institution suspended the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). In keeping with regulatory guidance to work with borrowers during this unprecedented situation, the Company has executed a payment deferral program for our lending clients that are adversely affected by the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had modified three loans totaling $1.2 million consisting of principal deferrals or principal and interest deferrals. In accordance with the CARES Act issued in April 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 signed in December 2020, these short-term deferrals are not considered troubled debt restructurings.
•
The CARES Act authorized the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) to temporarily guarantee loans under a new loan program call the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). As a qualified SBA lender, we were automatically authorized to originate PPP loans. The Company is actively participating in assisting our customers with applications for resources through the program. PPP loans will have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0%, (b) a five-year loan term to maturity for loans made on or after June 5, 2020 (loans made prior to June 5, 2020 have a two-year term, however borrowers and lenders may mutually agree to extend the maturity for such loans to five years); and (c) principal and interest payments deferred for six months from the date of disbursement. The SBA will guarantee 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company originated a total of $30.1 million in PPP loans for customers and recognized $480,000 in fees received from the SBA. As of December 31, 2020, we have PPP loans outstanding totaling $18.1 million.
Our fee income could be reduced due to COVID-19. In keeping with guidance from regulators, we are working with COVID-19 affected customers to waive fees from a variety of sources, such as, but not limited to, insufficient funds and overdraft fees, ATM fees, account maintenance fees, etc. These reductions in fees are thought, at this time, to be temporary in conjunction with the length of the expected COVID-19 related economic crisis. At this time, we are unable to project the materiality of such an impact, but recognize the breadth of the economic impact is likely to impact our fee income in future periods.
Our interest income could be reduced due to COVID-19. In keeping with guidance from regulators, we are actively working with COVID-19 affected borrowers to defer their payments, interest, and fees. While interest and fees will still accrue to income, through normal GAAP accounting, should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At this time, we are unable to project the materiality of such an impact, but recognize the breadth of the economic impact may affect our borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods.
Capital and liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, all of our capital ratios, and our subsidiary bank’s capital ratios, were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by COVID-19, our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit losses.
We maintain access to multiple sources of liquidity. Wholesale funding markets have remained open to us, but rates for short term funding have recently been volatile. If funding costs are elevated for an extended period of time, it could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin. If an extended recession causes large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
There were no Significant Items during the year ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets.
Allowance for Loan Losses. WaterStone Bank establishes valuation allowances on loans deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that WaterStone Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. A valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral (specific component). WaterStone Bank recognizes the change in present value of expected future cash flows on impaired loans attributable to the passage of time as bad debt expense. On an ongoing basis, at least quarterly for financial reporting purposes, the fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans and real estate owned is determined or reaffirmed by the following procedures:
●
Obtaining updated real estate appraisals or performing updated discounted cash flow analysis;
●
Confirming that the physical condition of the real estate has not significantly changed since the last valuation date;
●
Comparing the estimated current book value to that of updated sales values experienced on similar real estate owned;
●
Comparing the estimated current book value to that of updated values seen on more current appraisals of similar properties; and
●
Comparing the estimated current book value to that of updated listed sales prices on our real estate owned and that of similar properties (not owned by the Company).
WaterStone Bank also establishes valuation allowances based on an evaluation of the various risk components that are inherent in the credit portfolio (general component). The risk components that are evaluated include past loan loss experience; the level of non-performing and classified assets; current economic conditions; volume, growth, and composition of the loan portfolio; adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay; the estimated value of any underlying collateral; regulatory guidance; and other relevant factors. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans and reduced by charge-offs. Charge-offs approximate the amount by which the outstanding principal balance exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral. The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the WaterStone Bank Board of Directors. The allowance reflects management’s best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the probable loss on impaired loans and other inherent losses in the loan portfolio, and is based on a risk model developed and implemented by management and approved by the WaterStone Bank Board of Directors.
Actual results could differ from this estimate, and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions. More specifically, if our future charge-off experience increases substantially from our past experience, or if the value of underlying loan collateral, in our case mostly real estate, declines in value by a substantial amount, or if unemployment in our primary market area increases significantly, our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate and we will incur higher provisions for loan losses and lower net income in the future.
In addition, state and federal regulators periodically review the WaterStone Bank allowance for loan losses. Such regulators have the authority to require WaterStone Bank to recognize additions to the allowance at the time of their examination.
Income Taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal, combined state income tax, and separate state income tax returns. The provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on the income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
Under generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is “more likely than not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. Examples of positive evidence may include the existence of taxes paid in available carry-back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods. Examples of negative evidence may include cumulative losses in a current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends.
Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The benefit of uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a standard framework for measuring and disclosing fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. A number of valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the Company’s financial statements. The valuation techniques include quoted market prices for investment securities, appraisals of real estate from independent licensed appraisers and other valuation techniques. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates, and are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors. Therefore, the valuation results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there are inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values. Significant changes in the aggregate fair value of assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value or for impairment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations under the framework established by generally accepted accounting principles.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Refer to Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
Comparison of Consolidated Waterstone Financial, Inc. Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and at December 31, 2019
Total Assets. Total assets increased by $188.2 million, or 9.4%, to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.00 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets primarily reflects an increase in loans held for sale, cash and cash equivalents, and prepaid expenses and other assets due to an increase in the fair market value of the loan rate lock commitments partially offset by a decrease in securities available for sale and loans receivable. The total assets increase reflects liability increases in deposits, additional short-term debt, and other liabilities due to hedging liabilities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $20.5 million to $94.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $74.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflects the additional source of funds through an increase in deposits and short-term borrowings along with available for sale securities payments and loans held for investment payoffs. Offsetting the increases, cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to the use of cash to fund loans held for sale, pay dividends, and repurchase shares since December 31, 2019.
Securities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale decreased by $18.9 million to $159.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $178.5 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to paydowns in mortgage related securities and maturities of debt securities exceeding security purchases during the year.
Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale increased $181.9 million, or 82.6%, to $402.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $220.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to the production increase of refinance products, which was driven by the reduction in mortgage rates compared to the end of last year.
Loans Receivable. Loans receivable held for investment decreased $12.9 million, or 0.9%, to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.39 billion at December, 31, 2019. The decrease in total loans receivable was primarily attributable to decreases in the one- to four-family, multi-family, home equity, and consumer categories. Offsetting those decreases, the construction and land, commercial real estate, and commercial loan categories increased. The growth in the commercial loan category was driven by $18.1 million of PPP loans originated and still outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses increased $6.4 million to $18.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $12.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from a provision due to increased economic uncertainty increasing the required allowance related to the loans collectively reviewed. The overall increase was primarily related to each of the one- to four-family, multi-family, construction and land, commercial real estate, consumer, and commercial categories. See Note 3 for further discussion on the allowance for loan losses.
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. Total Federal Home Loan Bank stock increased $5.6 million to $26.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $21.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase reflects the ownership requirements in conjunction with the additional FHLB borrowings.
Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance. Total cash surrender value of life insurance decreased $6.1 million, to $63.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $69.7 million. The decrease is primarily related to the death benefit received on two policies during 2020 offset by continued earnings and annual premiums paid.
Real Estate Owned. Total real estate owned decreased $426,000, to $322,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $748,000 at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $637,000 was transferred from loans to real estate owned upon completion of foreclosure. During the same period, sales of real estate owned totaled $1.1 million. There were no write-downs during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets. Total prepaid expenses and other assets increased $26.3 million to $57.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $31.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in loan rate lock commitments, funding receivables from investors, and receivables from back-to-back interest rate swaps.
Deposits. Deposits increased by $117.1 million to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.07 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by an increase of $97.4 million in money market and savings deposits and $58.2 million in demand deposits offset by a decrease of $38.4 million in time deposits.
Borrowings. Total borrowings increased $24.5 million to $508.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $483.6 million at December 31, 2019. The community banking segment added $29.0 million in short-term FHLB borrowings. External short-term borrowings at the mortgage banking segment decreased a total of $4.5 million to $9.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $13.6 million at December 31, 2019.
Other Liabilities. Other liabilities increased $27.9 million to $75.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $47.1 million at December 31, 2019. Other liabilities increased primarily due to liabilities resulting from payables due on back-to-back swaps, legal settlement, accrued compensation, dividends payable, and forward commitments to sell loans at the mortgage banking segment.
Shareholders’ Equity. Shareholders’ equity increased by $19.4 million, or 4.9%, to $413.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $393.7 million at December 31, 2019. Shareholders' equity increased primarily due to net income, additional paid-in capital as stock options were exercised and equity awards vested, an increase in fair value of the security portfolio, and unearned ESOP shares vesting. Partially offsetting the increases, there were decreases due to the declaration of regular and special dividends and the repurchase of stock.
Comparison of Community Banking Segment Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net income from our community banking segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $21.2 million compared to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net interest income increased $597,000 to $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net interest income increased primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as interest on time deposits decreased as replacement rates were lower. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest expense, interest income decreased primarily due to decreases in loan interest, mortgage-related securities, and debt securities, federal funds sold and short-term investments interest.
The Company delayed adoption of ASC Topic 326 as permitted under the CARES Act. The Company calculated the allowance using the incurred loss model. Provision for loan losses was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a negative provision of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as economic conditions significantly worsened during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Noninterest income increased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to increases in loan fees and a gain from death benefits on bank owned life insurance. The loan fees increased primarily due to loan prepayment fees and fees earned on loan swaps. Cash surrender value of life insurance decreased as the balance decreased due to death benefit proceeds received on two bank owned life insurance policies. Other income increased primarily due to gain on death benefits, wealth management fees, and rental income.
Compensation, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits expense increased $2.0 million to $20.2 million due primarily to an increase in salaries expense, health insurance expense, and variable compensation. Occupancy, office furniture and equipment decreased due primarily to computer supplies and snow plowing expense. Data processing and advertising expense increased primarily due to the rollout of a new digital banking platform and promotions for deposit customers during the year ended December 31, 2020. Communications expense, real estate owned, and other expenses increased while professional fees expense decreased.
Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net income totaled $59.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We originated $4.43 billion in mortgage loans held for sale (including sales to the community banking segment) during the year ended December 31, 2020, which represents an increase of $1.51 billion, or 51.6%, from the $2.92 billion originated during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in loan production volume was driven by a $1.18 billion, or 216.2%, increase in refinance products driven by a decrease in fixed mortgage rates. Mortgage purchase products increased $330.2 million, or 13.9% due to an increased housing demand. Total mortgage banking noninterest income increased $109.7 million, or 86.5%, to $236.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $126.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in mortgage banking noninterest income was related to a 51.6% increase in volume and an 20.2% increase in gross margin on loans originated and sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. The increase in gross margin on loans originated and sold reflects industry demand due to the low rate environment resulting in higher volume. We sell loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing-retained basis. Waterstone Mortgage Corporation has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which we retain servicing.
Additionally, our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority or U.S. Department of Agriculture loan. Our origination efforts continue to be focused on loans made for the purpose of residential purchases, as opposed to mortgage refinance. The percentage of origination volume related to purchase activity decreased to 61.1% from 81.4% of total originations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as refinance demand accelerated from the low rate environment. The mix of loan type trended towards more conventional loans and less governmental loans; with conventional loans and governmental loans comprising 75.8% and 24.2%, respectively of all loan originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 69.5% and 30.5% of all originations, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, mortgage servicing rights related to $975.9 million in loans receivable with a book value of $6.4 million were sold at a gain of $600,000. There were no sales of mortgage servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits increased $35.2 million, or 41.8%, to $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $84.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in compensation expense was primarily a result of the increase in commission expense as fundings increased, along with an increase in bonus and incentives due to a record level of originations. In addition, branch manager pay increased as branches were more profitable due to increased volume and margin during the year. Occupancy, office furniture, and equipment expense decreased due to lower rent expense as underperforming branches closed offset by an increase in computer expenses to accommodate remote work. Advertising expense decreased as the low rate environment attracted customers. Loan processing expenses increased as loan costs increased due to loan application volume. Professional fees increased primarily due to a $4.25 million legal settlement in 2020 (see further discussion in Note 14 - Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Contingent Liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information) along with ongoing litigation costs. Other noninterest expense increased primarily due to increased provision for loan sale losses driven by an increase in sales volumes and increased uncertainty regarding selling loans to third party investors from COVID-19 pandemic challenges and the amortization of mortgage servicing rights as the value of the servicing portfolio has increased in 2020 compared to 2019.
Waterstone Mortgage Corporation originates loans in various states. The states where we originate greater than 10% of total activity are Florida and New Mexico.
Comparison of Consolidated Waterstone Financial, Inc. Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Average Balance Sheets, Interest and Yields/Costs
The following table set forth average balance sheets, annualized average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of the average balances of loans receivable and held for sale. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. Yields on interest-earning assets are computed on a fully tax-equivalent yield, where applicable.
(1) Includes net deferred loan fee amortization income of $1.7 million, $672,000 and $622,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
(2) Includes available for sale securities.
(3) Interest income from tax exempt securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. The yields on debt securities, federal funds sold and short-term investments before tax-equivalent adjustments were 1.79%, 2.49%, and 2.29% for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
(4) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities and is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis.
(5) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.
(6) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments for either of the years ending December 31, 2020 or 2019.
(1) Includes net deferred loan fee amortization income of $1.7 million, $672,000 and $622,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
(2) Non-accrual loans have been included in average loans receivable balance.
(3) Includes available for sale securities.
(4) Interest income from tax exempt securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased $1.3 million, or 2.5%, to $53.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
•
Interest income on loans increased $398,000 due primarily to an increase of $170.1 million, or 11.0%, in average loans offset by a 44 basis point decrease in average yield on loans as LIBOR based loans repriced and U.S. Treasury rates decreased new loan offering rates. The increase in average loan balance was driven by a $33.0 million, or 2.4%, increase in the average balance of loans held in portfolio and by an increase of $137.1 million, or 81.9%, in the average balance of loans held for sale. PPP loan fees increased interest income $480,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•
Interest income from mortgage-related securities decreased $490,000 primarily because the average balance of mortgage related securities decreased $12.3 million. Additionally, the average yield decreased 17 basis points.
•
Interest income from other interest-earning assets (comprised of debt securities, federal funds sold and short-term investments) decreased $1.2 million due to a 70 basis point decrease in the average yield. The decrease in average yield was primarily driven by the decrease in federal funds rate earned on cash balances over the past year and matured higher yielding securities reinvested at lower rates. Offsetting the decrease in yield, the average balance increased $6.0 million to $187.9 million due to increased FHLB stock with additional FHLB borrowings and higher short-term investments. Offsetting those balance increases, the balance of municipal securities decreased as maturities occurred throughout the past 12 months and were not replaced at the same rate due to market conditions.
•
Interest expense on time deposits decreased $3.4 million, or 21.5%, primarily due to a 46 basis point decrease in average cost of time deposits. Additionally, the average balance of time deposits decreased $4.4 million compared to the prior year period.
•
Interest expense on money market, savings, and escrow accounts increased $521,000, or 41.8%, due primarily to an increase in average balance of $66.7 million along with a four basis point increase in average cost of money market, savings, and escrow accounts. Money market accounts have been a focus over the year and the Company has actively marketed new customers through various new offerings and new branches that opened within the past 12 months.
•
Interest expense on borrowings increased $353,000, or 1.9%, due to an increase of $60.9 million to $545.7 million in average borrowing volume during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the funding of the loans held for sale. Offsetting the increase in volume, the average cost of borrowings decreased 17 basis points to 1.95% during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.12% during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the cost of borrowings resulted from the new short-term fundings borrowed at a lower rate.
Provision for Loan Losses
The Company delayed adoption of ASC Topic 326 as permitted under the CARES Act. As a result, the Company calculated the current year allowance using the incurred loss model. The provision for loan losses was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a negative provision for loan losses of $900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as economic conditions worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic along with an increase of loan downgrades to our Watch category. Additional qualitative risk factors were applied to each of the loan categories primarily to account for the significant increase in the unemployment rate and those downgrades. We had a provision for loan losses of $6.1 million at the community banking segment and $265,000 for the mortgage banking segment. Net recoveries were $96,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The provision is primarily a function of the Company's reserving methodology and assessments of certain quantitative and qualitative factors which are used to determine an appropriate allowance for loan losses for the period. See further discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses in the "Asset Quality" section for an analysis of charge-offs, nonperforming assets, specific reserves and additional provisions and the "Allowance for Loan Loss" section.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income increased $113.3 million, or 86.6%, to $244.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $130.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in mortgage banking income along with increases in service charges on loans and deposit and other income categories.
•
The $107.6 million increase in mortgage banking income was primarily the result of an increase in loan origination volume. Total loan origination volume on a consolidated basis increased $1.48 billion, or 51.8%, to $4.33 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.85 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross margin on loans originated and sold increased 20.2% at the mortgage banking segment. Gross margin on loans originated and sold is the ratio of mortgage banking income (excluding the change in interest rate lock fair value) divided by total loan originations. See "Comparison of Mortgage Banking Segment Results of Operations for the Year December 31, 2020 and 2019" above, for additional discussion of the increase in mortgage banking income.
•
The increase in service charges on loans and deposits was due to an increase of loan prepayment fees on existing loans and fees earned on loan swaps.
•
The decrease in cash surrender value of life insurance was due primarily to a lower average balance as death benefits were received on two policies during the year.
•
The increase in other noninterest income was due primarily to increases in gain from death benefit on bank owned life insurance, mortgage servicing fee income, gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights, wealth management revenue, and rental income. Mortgage servicing fee income increased as loans sold with servicing rights retained increased due to market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold mortgage servicing rights related to $975.9 million in loans receivable and with a book value of $6.4 million for $7.0 million resulting in a gain on sale of $600,000. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold no mortgage servicing rights.
Noninterest Expenses
Total noninterest expenses increased $46.8 million, or 34.3%, to $183.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $136.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
•
Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefit expense at our mortgage banking segment increased $35.2 million, or 41.8%, to $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in compensation expense was primarily a result of an increase in commission expense as fundings increased and branch manager pay increased as branches were more profitable.
•
Compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits expense at the community banking segment increased $2.0 million, or 11.2%, to $20.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries expense due to annual raises, health insurance expense as claims increased, and variable compensation as executives are eligible for an increased bonus. Offsetting the increases, equity award expense decreased as a majority of awards granted in 2015 had a final vesting in 2019.
•
Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the mortgage banking segment decreased $319,000 to $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year resulting from lower rent expense as a result of underperforming branches closing. Offsetting the decreases, computer expenses increased to accommodate remote working.
•
Occupancy, office furniture and equipment expense at the community banking segment decreased $64,000 to $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to lower computer, furniture and equipment, and snow plowing expense.
•
Advertising expense decreased $315,000 at the mortgage banking segment as lower rates generated customer activity. Offsetting the decrease at the mortgage banking segment, advertising increased $121,000 at the community banking segment to promote the opening of a new branch, the release of the new digital banking platform, and additional promotions for deposit customers.
•
Data processing expense increased $311,000 to $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the new digital banking platform rollout at the community banking segment and new contracts at the mortgage banking segment as technology investments continue to increase.
•
Professional fees expense increased $4.5 million to $8.1 million primarily as a result of an increase in legal fees at the mortgage banking segment for a $4.25 million legal settlement (see further discussion in Note 14 - Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Contingent Liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information) and ongoing litigation costs. Offsetting the increase at the mortgage banking segment, the community banking segment decreased primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees.
•
Loan processing expense increased $1.4 million to $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in loan costs associated with the application volumes as mortgage rates declined.
•
Other noninterest expense at the mortgage banking segment increased $3.6 million to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increased provision for loan sale losses as there was additional uncertainty regarding selling loans to third party investors from COVID-19 pandemic challenges. Additionally, amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased as the value of the servicing portfolio has increased in 2020 compared to 2019. Other noninterest expenses at the community banking segment increased $302,000 to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to loan related costs along with an increase in FDIC insurance premiums as credits were used in 2019 but were fully utilized early in 2020.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense increased $15.3 million to $27.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as pretax income increased $60.5 million. Income tax expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 at an effective rate of 24.9% compared to an effective rate of 24.5% during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recognized a benefit of $354,000 related to the proceeds received on the bank owned life insurance death benefit during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet our liquidity needs. The liquidity ratio is equal to average daily cash and cash equivalents for the period divided by average total assets. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund loan commitments, repay our borrowings, fund deposit outflows and pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. The operational adequacy of our liquidity position at any point in time is dependent upon the judgment of the Chief Financial Officer as supported by the Asset/Liability Committee. Liquidity is monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis using a variety of measurement tools and indicators. Regulatory liquidity, as required by the WDFI, is based on current liquid assets as a percentage of the prior month’s average deposits and short-term borrowings. Minimum primary liquidity is equal to 4.0% of deposits and short-term borrowings and minimum total regulatory liquidity is equal to 8.0% of deposits and short-term borrowings. The Bank’s primary and total regulatory liquidity at December 31, 2020 were 12.2% and 23.1%, respectively.
Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and repayment of loans, sales of loans held for sale, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competitors. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term, interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Additional sources of liquidity used to manage long- and short-term cash flows include advances from the FHLB.
A portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $94.8 million and $74.3 million, respectively, of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the calls and maturities of debt and mortgage related securities, increases in deposit accounts, Federal funds purchased and advances from the FHLB.
Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, we originated $4.33 billion and $2.85 billion in loans for sale and sold loans of $4.40 billion and $2.90 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, loan repayments net of loan originations resulted in a positive cash flows of $12.4 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, loan originations net of loan repayments resulted in a negative cash flows of $9.9 million. Cash received from the principal repayments of debt and mortgage related securities and maturity and calls of debt securities totaled $50.5 million and $40.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We purchased $29.5 million and $28.9 million in debt securities and mortgage related securities classified as available for sale during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net increases in deposits were $117.1 million and $29.3 million for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019. We received a $9.6 million death benefit on a bank owned life insurance policy in 2020. There was a net increase in borrowings of $24.5 million and $48.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased common stock of $36.2 million and $22.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we paid cash dividends on common stock of $31.5 million and $26.0 million, respectively.
Deposits increased by $117.1 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The increase was driven by an increase of $97.4 million in money market and savings deposits and $58.2 million in demand deposits offset by a decrease of $38.4 million in time deposits. Deposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates, market conditions and products offered by local competitors and other factors.
Liquidity management is both a daily and longer-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB which provide an additional source of funds. At December 31, 2020, we had $29.0 million in short term advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2020, we had $470.0 million in long term advances from the FHLB with contractual maturity dates in 2027, 2028, and 2029. The 2027 advance has a contractual maturity date in December 2027. There are two 2028 advances that have contractual maturities in 2028. The remaining 2028 advance maturities have single call options in March 2021, and May 2021, along with two advances that have quarterly call options beginning in June 2020 and September 2020. The 2029 advance maturities have quarterly call options currently available and the other options that began in November 2020, beginning in August 2021, and beginning in May 2022. As an additional source of funds, the mortgage banking segment has a repurchase agreement. At December 31, 2020, we had $9.1 million outstanding under the repurchase agreement with a total outstanding commitment of $55.0 million.
At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans receivable of $23.9 million. In addition, at December 31, 2020, we had unfunded commitments under construction loans of $74.2 million, unfunded commitments under business lines of credit of $19.2 million and unfunded commitments under home equity lines of credit and standby letters of credit of $14.9 million. At December 31, 2020, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled $576.9 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window or brokered deposits to maintain our level of assets. However, such borrowings may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, if and when needed. Alternatively, we would reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale in order to meet funding needs. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal.
Capital
Shareholders’ equity increased by $19.4 million, or 4.9%, to $413.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $393.7 million at December 31, 2019. Shareholders' equity increased primarily due to net income, additional paid-in capital as stock options were exercised and equity awards vested, an increase in fair value of the security portfolio, and unearned ESOP shares vesting. Partially offsetting the increases, there were decreases due to the declaration of regular and special dividends and the repurchase of stock.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program in the third quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had repurchased 10.7 million shares at an average price of $14.39 under previously approved stock repurchase plans.
Waterstone Financial, Inc. and WaterStone Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2020, Waterstone Financial, Inc. and WaterStone Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and are considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See “Supervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements” and Note 9 - Regulatory Capital of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation.
Quarterly Financial Information
