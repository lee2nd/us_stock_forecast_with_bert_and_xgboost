Management’s Discussion and Analysis
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations analyzes the major elements of Mid Penn’s consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation and Notes thereto and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The comparability of the results of operations for the year ended 2020, compared to 2019 and 2018, in general, have been materially impacted by the acquisition of The Scottdale Bank and Trust Company, which closed on January 8, 2018, and the acquisition of First Priority Financial Corp., which closed on July 31, 2018. For comparative purposes, some 2019 and 2018 balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on net income available to common shareholders or shareholders’ equity.
Mid Penn is not aware of any current trends, events, uncertainties or any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on Mid Penn’s or the Bank’s liquidity, capital resources, or operations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Mid Penn’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the banking industry for smaller reporting public companies. Application of certain principles involves significant judgments and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates used in applying these principles are based on historical experiences and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and estimates that have been made, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported results of operations.
Management of the Corporation considers the accounting judgments relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the evaluation of the Corporation’s investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, the valuation of the Corporation’s goodwill for impairment, and the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments.
The allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience adjusted for subjectively determined qualitative factors, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet. Throughout the remainder of this report, the terms “loan” or “loans” refers to both loans and leases.
Valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, investment valuation is based on pricing models, quotes for similar investment securities, and observable values based upon yield curves and spreads. In addition to valuation of securities, management must assess whether there are any declines where the fair value is below the carrying value of any investments such that the decline should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income.
Certain intangible assets generated in connection with acquisitions are periodically assessed for impairment. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, and if certain events occur which indicate goodwill might be impaired between annual tests, such as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, goodwill must be tested when such events occur. In making this assessment, Mid Penn considers a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, current market data, stock price, etc. Similarly, the amortized basis of the core deposit intangible asset and trade name intangible are periodically assessed for impairment. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and Mid Penn’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of core deposit intangible, trade name intangible, and goodwill impairment. Future changes in economic and operating conditions could result in goodwill or core deposit intangible or trade name intangible impairment in subsequent periods.
Valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. In many cases, determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires Mid Penn to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to result from these assets and liabilities and to discount these cash flows at appropriate rates of interest, which require the utilization of significant estimates and judgment in accounting for the acquisition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Financial Summary
2020 versus 2019
Mid Penn’s net income to common shareholders (earnings) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $26,209,000 or $3.11 per common share basic and $3.10 per share diluted, compared to earnings of $17,701,000 or $2.09 per common share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2019. The results for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the recognition of $13,137,000 of PPP loan processing fees generated as a result of Mid Penn’s participation in the PPP. These PPP fees are recognized into interest income over the term of the respective loan (most have a 24-month maturity), or sooner if the loans are forgiven by the Small Business Administration or the borrowers otherwise pay down principal prior to a loan’s stated maturity.
Total assets of Mid Penn were $2,998,948,000 as of December 31, 2020, reflecting an increase of $767,773,000 or 34 percent compared to total assets of $2,231,175,000 as of December 31, 2019. Included in this increase is the significant volume of $388,313,000 of Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans outstanding, net of deferred fees, as of December 31, 2020. Total core banking loans (total loans excluding both the PPP portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale) increased to $1,995,728,000 as of December 31, 2020, representing an annualized core loan growth rate of over 13 percent since the end of 2019. The asset growth was funded primarily by both (i) $562,186,000 of deposit growth, representing an annual deposit growth rate of over 29 percent, including an increase of $226,188,000 in noninterest-bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020; and (ii) a $167,829,000 net increase in borrowings, including $125,617,000 of funding obtained from the Federal Reserve through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”). Under the PPPLF, the Federal Reserve supplies financing to the Bank at a rate of 35 basis points (0.35%) for a term and amount determined based on the principal amount of PPP loans fully and specifically pledged as collateral in support of the PPPLF borrowings. Draws of PPPLF funds must be repaid to the Federal Reserve immediately after the specific PPP loans collateralizing the related draws are repaid to the Bank.
As part of the annual increase in borrowings, long-term debt increased from $32,903,000 at December 31, 2019 to $75,115,000 at December 31, 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, Mid Penn executed a new Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) two-year term lower-cost borrowing of $70,000,000 to fund anticipated core loan growth. This increase was partially offset by the prepayment of $27,500,000 of higher-cost long-term FHLB borrowings. Mid Penn recognized $165,000 of FHLB prepayment penalties, which were recorded within other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Mid Penn recognized $93,000 of FHLB prepayment penalties during the year ended December 31, 2019 attributable to the prepayment of $20,000,000 of higher-cost FHLB borrowings.
Subordinated Debt
Subordinated debt outstanding increased $17,510,000 or 65 percent, from $27,070,000 at December 31, 2019 to $44,580,000 at December 31, 2020. The year-over-year increase reflects the net impact of three subordinated debt transactions:
•
In March 2020, Mid Penn issued an aggregate of $15,000,000 of Subordinated Notes due March 2030 (the “March 2020 Notes”) to accredited investors. The March 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4 percent per year for the first five years and then float at the Wall Street Journal’s Prime Rate, and are intended to be treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.
•
In December 2020, Mid Penn issued an aggregate of $12,150,000 of Subordinated Notes due December 2030 (the “December 2020 Notes”) to accredited investors. The December 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5 percent per year for the first five years and then float at the Wall Street Journal’s Prime Rate, and are intended to be treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.
•
Also, during the fourth quarter of 2020, Mid Penn redeemed $9,500,000 in subordinated debt assumed in 2018 in conjunction with Mid Penn’s acquisition of First Priority Bank. The First Priority Bank subordinated debt paid a high fixed rate of interest of 7 percent, and was redeemed promptly following the expiration of the noncallable period and after receiving the required regulatory approval for the redemption. Mid Penn recognized prepayment fees of $143,000 related to the early redemption, which are included in other noninterest expenses.
Mid Penn’s return on average shareholders’ equity (“ROE”), a widely recognized performance indicator in the financial industry, was 10.76% in 2020 and 7.67% in 2019. Return on average assets (“ROA”), another performance indicator, was 0.95% in 2020 and 0.82% in 2019.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Mid Penn’s tax-equivalent net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.48 percent versus 3.57 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased from 4.83 percent for 2019 to 4.25 percent for 2020. The net interest margin and yields on loans and interest-earning assets reflect the recognition of PPP loan processing fees in total interest income. Though the average balance of interest-earning assets increased year over year, the yields on interest-earning assets declined due to both (i) the significant average balance of PPP loans, which earn interest at a rate of 1 percent while outstanding, and (ii) reductions in market interest rates and the impact on the yields of loans, investments, and overnight funds subsequent to December 2019 as a result of the 1.50 percent of combined Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) rate cuts during March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The total cost of deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 favorably decreased to 0.72 percent compared to 1.19 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the aforementioned growth in noninterest-bearing deposits, and from deposit rate decrease adjustments made during the year, including those made in response to the March 2020 FOMC rate cuts. Further discussion of the net interest margin can be found in the Net Interest Income section below.
Mid Penn’s allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2020 was $13,382,000 or 0.56% of total loans (less unearned discount), as compared to $9,515,000 or 0.54% at December 31, 2019. Mid Penn had net loan charge-offs of $333,000 and $272,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Further discussion of these items can be found in the Provision for Loan and Lease Losses section below.
Total nonperforming assets were $15,644,000 at December 31, 2020, an increase compared to nonperforming assets of $12,157,000 at December 31, 2019. Further discussion of the components of nonperforming assets can be found in the Credit Quality, Credit Risk, and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses section below.
The Corporation’s regulatory capital measures of Tier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets) of $188,501,000 or 9.6%, and Total Capital (to risk weighted assets) of $246,529,000 or 12.6%, at December 31, 2020, are above the regulatory “well capitalized” requirements. Tier 1 Capital consists primarily of Mid Penn’s shareholders' equity less the value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and excluding the impact of the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component. Total Capital includes the Tier 1 Capital, as well as Mid Penn’s qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, within permitted regulatory limits. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various levels of risk, in accordance with regulatory risk-weighting definitions, to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet activities.
2019 versus 2018
Mid Penn’s net income available to common shareholders (“earnings”) was $17,701,000 or $2.09 per common share basic and diluted, compared to earnings of $10,494,000 or $1.49 per common share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $4,790,000 of merger and acquisition expenses resulting from both (i) Mid Penn’s acquisition of First Priority Financial Corp. (“First Priority”) on July 31, 2018, and (ii) Mid Penn’s acquisition of The Scottdale Bank & Trust Company (“Scottdale”) on January 8, 2018.
Total assets of Mid Penn grew $153,194,000 or 7 percent in 2019 to close the year at $2,231,175,000, compared to total assets of $2,077,981,000 as of December 31, 2018. Asset growth during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to net organic loan growth, an increase in liquid assets from demand deposit growth, and the recording of operating and finance lease right of use assets as a result of Mid Penn’s adoption of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842 - Leases effective January 1, 2019. Please reference Note 25, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, within Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding the adoption of ASC 842.
Decreases in short-term and long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2019 were the result of both (i) the paydown of $43,100,000 of short-term borrowings during 2019, and (ii) the prepayment of $20 million of FHLB fixed rate borrowings originally due in 2020. Mid Penn recognized a prepayment penalty of $93,000 related to these early payoffs. The prepayment penalty is included in other expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Mid Penn’s return on average shareholders’ equity (“ROE”), a widely recognized performance indicator in the financial industry, was 7.67% in 2019 and 5.98% in 2018. Return on average assets (“ROA”), another performance indicator, was 0.82% in 2019 and 0.63% in 2018.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Net interest margin was 3.57% in 2019 versus 3.67% in 2018. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to $71,012,000 in 2019 from $56,824,000 in 2018, as the 2019 net interest income reflected the full year impact of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities from the two 2018 acquisitions. Despite year-over-year increases in yields on interest-earning assets and growth in noninterest-bearing deposits, the decrease in net interest margin was driven by both (i) the higher cost of deposits and borrowed funds as a result of higher short-term rates for much of 2019 and defensive deposit rate increase responsive to strong bank and nonbank competition for retail deposit customer market share, and (ii) the full-year impact of the higher-cost wholesale funding sources assumed effective July 31, 2018 with the First Priority acquisition, including brokered time deposits and subordinated debt. Further discussion of net interest margin can be found in the Net Interest Income section below.
Mid Penn’s allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2019 was $9,515,000 or 0.54% of total loans (less unearned discount), as compared to $8,397,000 or 0.52% at December 31, 2018. Mid Penn had net loan charge-offs of $272,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net recoveries of $291,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. The net charge-off position in 2019 was primarily due to a $205,000 charge-off taken on one relationship during the second quarter of 2019. The favorable net recovery position during 2018 was driven by the recovery of $777,000 of principal from the successful workout of a commercial real estate relationship that originally had a large partial charge-off in 2009. Further discussion of these items can be found in the Provision for Loan and Lease Losses section below.
Total nonperforming assets were $12,157,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to nonperforming assets of $12,283,000 at December 31, 2018. Further discussion of the components of nonperforming assets can be found in the Credit Quality, Credit Risk, and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses section below.
The Corporation’s regulatory capital measures of Tier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets) of $168,146,000 or 9.8%, and Total Capital (to risk weighted assets) of $204,811,000 or 11.9%, at December 31, 2019, are above the regulatory “well capitalized” requirements. Tier 1 Capital consists primarily of Mid Penn’s shareholders' equity less the value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and excluding the impact of the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component. Total Capital includes the Tier 1 Capital, as well as Mid Penn’s qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, within permitted regulatory limits. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various levels of risk, in accordance with regulatory risk-weighting definitions, to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet activities.
The average balances, effective interest differential, and interest yields for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and the components of net interest income are presented below in Table 1. Table 2 provides a comparative presentation of the changes in net interest income for 2020 compared to 2019, and 2019 compared to 2018, by reflecting changes in interest income and interest expense caused by the volume and rate components of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, Mid Penn's primary source of earnings, represents the difference between interest income received on loans, investments, and overnight funds, and interest expense paid on deposits and short- and long-term borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and changes in average balances (volume) in the various interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Interest and average rates in Table 1 above are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent adjustments were calculated using statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For purposes of calculating loan yields, average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Loan fees of $15,795,000, $2,153,000 and $1,038,000 are included with loan interest income in Table 1 above for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Mid Penn recognized $13,137,000 of PPP fees which are included in loan fees. Similar fees were not recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.

The effect of changing volume and rate, which cannot be segregated, has been allocated entirely to the rate column. Tax-exempt income is shown on a tax equivalent basis using a statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Mid Penn’s tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.48% versus 3.57% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 3.67% for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2020, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $17,828,000 or 25 percent compared to 2019. During 2019, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $14,188,000 or 25 percent compared to 2018. The primary sources of the increased taxable equivalent net interest income for the 2020 year included (i) $2,292,000 of interest income from core loan growth, (ii) reduced interest expense due to a lower cost of deposits, and (iii) the recognition of $13,137,000 of PPP loan processing fees generated as a result of Mid Penn’s participation in the PPP. These PPP fees are recognized into interest income over the term of the respective loan (most have a 24-month maturity), or sooner if the loans are forgiven by the Small Business Administration or the borrowers otherwise pay down principal prior to a loan’s stated maturity.
The yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 4.25% in 2020, from 4.83% in 2019 and 4.50% in 2018. Though the average balance of interest-earning assets increased year over year, the yields on interest-earning assets declined due to both (i) the significant average balance of PPP loans, which earn interest at a rate of 1 percent while outstanding, and (ii) reductions in market interest rates and the impact of the yields on loans, investments, and overnight funds subsequent to December 2019 consisting of 1.50 percent of combined Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) rate cuts during March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Interest expense for 2020 decreased by $5,437,000 or 22 percent when compared to 2019. Interest expense for 2019 increased by $12,444,000 or 98 percent when compared to 2018. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.99% in 2020 from 1.56% in 2019 and 1.02% in 2018. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2020 was due to an increase of $226,188,000 in noninterest-bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020, and from deposit rate decrease adjustments made during the year, including those made in response to the March 2020 FOMC rate cuts.
Further changes to the future mix of the loan, investment, and deposit products in the Bank's portfolios, and the volume of variable rate and fixed rate instruments based upon new loan originations and investment purchases, may significantly change the net interest margin and the yields on earning-assets and the costs of interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, net interest income may be impacted by further interest rate actions of the Federal Reserve or other movements in market rates and the yield curve. Management continues to monitor the net interest margin closely.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
The provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. Mid Penn’s provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management’s monthly reviews of the loan portfolio throughout each year. The purpose of the monthly reviews is to assess loan quality, identify impaired loans and leases, analyze delinquencies, ascertain loan and lease growth, evaluate actual and potential charge-offs and recoveries, assess general economic conditions in the markets we serve, and determine appropriate loan loss provisions to maintain an adequate allowance.
Mid Penn has maintained the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with Mid Penn’s portfolio credit risk and potential loss assessment process, which took into consideration the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio, shifting collateral values, and the assessment of other relevant qualitative factors from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision for loan and lease losses was $4,200,000 representing an increase of over 200 percent compared to a provision for loan losses of $1,390,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses and the related provision reflect Mid Penn’s continued application of the incurred loss method for estimating credit losses as Mid Penn is not yet required to adopt the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) accounting standard. The increase in the loan loss reserves and the provision was primarily the result of (i) providing for the year-to-date core loan growth (excluding PPP loans), which was over 13 percent during the year ended December 31, 2020, and (ii) an increase in the values of qualitative factors applied related to economic and external conditions when compared to prior periods, with such changes driven by the potential for ongoing financial implications from the COVID-19 pandemic on Mid Penn’s customers and market area. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.56% at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.54% at December 31, 2019 and 0.52% at December 31, 2018.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Mid Penn had net charge-offs of $333,000 and $272,000, respectively, compared to net recoveries of $291,000 during the same period of 2018. Loans charged off during 2020 were comprised of four commercial real estate, construction, and land development loans totaling $265,000, three commercial and industrial loans for $45,000, one mortgage loan for $4,000, twelve consumer loans to unrelated borrowers totaling $37,000, and $21,000 of overdrawn deposit account charge-offs.
Mid Penn may need to make future adjustments to the allowance and the provision for loan and lease losses if economic conditions or loan credit quality or other relevant qualitative factors differ substantially from the assumptions used in making Mid Penn’s evaluation of the level of the allowance for loan losses as compared to the balance of outstanding loans.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, noninterest income totaled $17,908,000, an increase of $5,287,000 or 42 percent, compared to noninterest income of $12,621,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Mortgage banking income was $9,682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5,911,000 or more than double the mortgage banking income of $3,771,000 recorded during 2019. As mortgage interest rates declined and remained low for most of 2020, Mid Penn significantly increased residential mortgage originations (both purchase and refinance activity) and secondary-market loan sales and gains during 2020.
ATM debit card interchange income was $1,960,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $366,000 or 23 percent compared to interchange income of $1,594,000 for 2019. The increase resulted from increasing card-based transaction usage across our expanding checking account customer base.
Income from fiduciary and wealth management activities was $1,694,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $278,000 or 20 percent, compared to fiduciary income of $1,416,000 for 2019. The increased revenues in 2020 were attributed to growth in trust assets under management and increased sales of retail investment products.
Net gains on sales of investment securities were $467,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1,411,000 compared to net gains on sales of securities of $1,878,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, Mid Penn adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments and, as part of the adoption, Mid Penn reclassified several held-to-maturity debt securities with an aggregate amortized cost of $67,100,000 to the available-for-sale category. Through implementation of planned organic hedging activities as part of Mid Penn’s interest rate risk management, all the reclassified securities were subsequently sold, and Mid Penn realized a pre-tax gain on the sales of $1,779,000 in 2019. Investment sales and gains during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 reflect the continued implementation of asset/liability management strategies, which included effectively using some of these gains to offset $165,000 of debt prepayment penalties, recorded within other noninterest expenses, associated with the early redemption of higher-cost FHLB advances.
Service charges on deposits were $637,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting a decrease of $247,000 or 28 percent when compared to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to less overdraft activity and decreased nonsufficient funds fees charged to deposit customers.
Net gains on sales of SBA loans were $442,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $389,000 or 47 percent compared to net gains on sales of SBA loans of $831,000 during 2019. Much of the decrease is due to the temporary shift of the resources in our SBA lending function to focus on the SBA-administered PPP loan processing, funding, and forgiveness during 2020.
Other income was $2,333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $813,000 compared to other income of $1,520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in other income was primarily driven by higher volumes of fee-based income, including loan-level swap fees, wire transfer fees, letter of credit fees, and credit card program referrals and royalties.

2019 versus 2018
For the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest income totaled $12,621,000, an increase of $5,159,000 or 69 percent, compared to noninterest income of $7,462,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Mortgage banking income was $3,771,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $3,020,000 or over 400 percent compared to mortgage banking income of $751,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Mid Penn expanded its team of residential mortgage originators in southeastern Pennsylvania during 2019, contributing to the larger volume of mortgage loans originated and sold during the year. Additionally, longer-term mortgage interest rates have declined significantly over the past twelve months, resulting in a higher level of mortgage originations and secondary-market loan sales during 2019.
Net gains on sales of securities were $1,878,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,741,000 compared to net gains on sales of securities of $137,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. As previously reported on a Form 8-K dated November 20, 2019, Mid Penn early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments), and as part of the adoption, Mid Penn reclassified 113 held-to-maturity debt securities with an aggregate amortized cost of $67,096,000 to the available-for-sale category. Through implementation of planned organic hedging activities as part of Mid Penn’s interest rate risk management, all 113 securities were subsequently sold during the fourth quarter of 2019, and Mid Penn realized a pre-tax gain on the sales of $1,779,000 which offset some of the market impact of lower earning-asset yields in the second half of 2019.
Income from fiduciary activities was $1,416,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $261,000 or 23 percent, compared to fiduciary income of $1,155,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. These additional revenues were attributed to growth in trust assets under management and increased sales of retail investment products, as a result of successful continued business development efforts by Mid Penn’s trust and wealth management team.
ATM debit card interchange income was $1,594,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $341,000 or 27 percent compared to interchange income of $1,253,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase resulted from increasing card-based transaction usage across our customer base, as well as the full-year impact of the added volume from demand deposit accounts assumed in the 2018 First Priority acquisition.
Net gains on sales of SBA loans were $831,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $270,000 or 48 percent compared to net gains on sales of SBA loans of $561,000 during 2018. The increase reflects Mid Penn’s continued growth in SBA loan production, reflective of both the Bank’s expanded footprint and its reputation as a preferred small business lender.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, merchant services income totaled $413,000, an increase of $66,000 or 19 percent, compared to $347,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase in the volume of business customers utilizing Mid Penn’s merchant services to process their debit card transactions, cash advances, and other related products. Mid Penn also established a relationship with a new merchant services vendor that has resulted in more favorable retention of revenues for the Bank.
Other income was $1,520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $519,000 compared to other income of $2,039,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the full-year 2018, Mid Penn recognized $737,000 of defined benefit pension plan settlement gains from certain plan participants receiving lump sum benefit payouts (the plan and related liabilities were assumed as a result of the Scottdale acquisition in January 2018). During the year ended December 31, 2019, a lower amount of pension plan lump sum payouts occurred, with related settlement gains totaling $34,000. Pension settlement gains are not expected to be a recurring item on a going-forward basis.

Noninterest Expense
2020 versus 2019
For the year ended December 31, 2020, noninterest expense totaled $70,577,000, an increase of $10,624,000 or 18 percent, compared to noninterest expense of $59,953,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Salaries and employee benefits were $37,758,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5,398,000 or 17 percent, versus 2019, with the increase primarily attributable to (i) increased commissions expense, commensurate with the mortgage loan origination and sales success of the mortgage banking group; (ii) increased compensation expense for the substantial time and effort devoted to the PPP loan initiative by many of our business development officers and staff members during 2020; and (iii) the addition of private banking and insurance business development professionals in our new nonbank subsidiaries.
Software licensing and utilization costs were $5,286,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $892,000 or 20 percent compared to $4,394,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase reflects the additional costs from both transaction volume-based charges, and licensing fees related to the addition of new staff and locations added since December 31, 2019, as well as costs associated with ensuring secure connectivity for an increased volume of employees working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Additionally, Mid Penn continued to invest in upgrades to internal systems, networks, storage capabilities, cybersecurity management, and data security mechanisms to enhance data management and security capabilities responsive to both the larger company profile and increasing complexity of information technology management.
FDIC assessment expense was $1,680,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $841,000 or more than double the $839,000 of FDIC assessment expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower assessment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected the receipt of $492,000 of FDIC small bank assessment credits in 2019. Similar credits were not received in 2020. Additionally, the total base assessment expense increased for 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily due to the significant year-over-year increase in total average assets of the Bank on which the assessment is based.

Community and charitable contributions qualifying for State tax credits totaled $1,342,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $587,000 compared to similar program contributions of $755,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Mid Penn was approved by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to contribute an increased tax-credit-qualifying amount to participants within Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development (“DCED”) Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program (“EITC”), and to moderate-to-low income housing projects in the DCED’s Neighborhood Assistance Program (“NAP”) during the year ended December 31, 2020. These EITC and NAP contributions in 2020 generated tax credits totaling $1,132,000 to be applied to Mid Penn’s Pennsylvania bank shares tax liability. These contributions and programs are also key elements of Mid Penn’s Community Reinvestment Act compliance activities.
Pennsylvania bank shares tax expense was $583,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $194,000 or 25 percent compared to $777,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in shares tax expense generally reflects the aforementioned larger dollar volume of EITC and NAP donations made, which qualified for PA shares tax credits.
Mortgage banking profit-sharing expense totaled $2,004,000 for payments accrued for or made to third-party principals commensurate with the record-level of earnings success within the Southeastern Pennsylvania mortgage banking group at Mid Penn for the year ended December 31, 2020. Similar expenses were not recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 as the group did not generate sufficient earnings in 2019 to qualify for profit-sharing to the third-party principals.
Marketing and advertising expense was $542,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $364,000 or 40 percent compared to $906,000 during the same period in 2019. The year of 2019 reflected additional advertising expense and promotional items expense to increase regional recognition and knowledge of Mid Penn’s First Priority Bank division and expanded mortgage origination operations in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Similar expenses were not recognized in 2020. Additionally, as a result of the pandemic, in-person promotional events were significantly reduced in 2020, resulting in less advertising and promotional items expense.
The loss on the sale or write-down of foreclosed assets was $333,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a gain on the sale of foreclosed assets of $15,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 expense is attributable to write-downs taken on two related foreclosed assets totaling $358,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. These write-downs were partially offset by $25,000 of collective gains on the sale of certain smaller foreclosed real estate properties during 2020.
2019 versus 2018
For the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest expense totaled $59,953,000, an increase of $9,782,000 or 20 percent, compared to noninterest expense of $50,171,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in noninterest expense for the twelve month period was driven by both (i) the full-year impact of the staff, facilities, and technology licensing costs added as a result of the acquisition of First Priority in July 2018, (ii) the 2019 expansion of Mid Penn’s mortgage banking division in the southeastern Pennsylvania market, and (iii) the addition of business development professionals, primarily in our recently-acquired markets, to better take advantage of new market opportunities to increase our revenues from lending and wealth management activities.
Salaries and employee benefits expenses were $32,360,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $8,498,000 or 36 percent, versus the same period in 2018, with the increase primarily attributable to (i) the full-year impact of the compensation and benefit costs of the commercial business officers and the retail staff from the First Priority acquisition, effective July 31, 2018, (ii) the personnel added as a result of the significant expansion of the mortgage banking division in 2019, and (iii) staff added as part of the new Hazle Township office opened during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Occupancy expenses increased $1,333,000 or 33 percent during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Similarly, equipment expense increased $461,000 or 21 percent during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. These increases related to (i) the full-year impact of the incremental facilities operating costs, including rent, utilities, and depreciation expense associated with the acquisition of First Priority, and (ii) expansion of the corporate administrative facilities to include expanded employee education facilities, and to realize additional efficiencies after the two 2018 mergers by further centralizing several back-office functions supporting the broader franchise.
Pennsylvania bank shares tax expense was $777,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $552,000 or over 200 percent compared to $225,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in assessment expense generally reflects the larger total shareholder equity balance upon which the tax is based (from both acquisition and organic growth activity) as of the tax measurement date of January 1, 2019 when compared to January 1, 2018. Both years also reflected the impact of Pennsylvania tax credits generated from the Bank’s Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) and Neighborhood Assistance Program (NAP) community giving, with these donations totaling $755,000 and $585,000 in 2019 and 2018 respectively, resulting in tax credits totaling $677,000 in 2019 and $522,000 in 2018.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
FDIC assessment expense was $839,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $67,000 or 9 percent compared to $772,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, Mid Penn received notification from the FDIC that the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio met a threshold resulting in the FDIC providing the Bank with a $492,000 credit, which was applied to assessment liability accruals for both the second and third quarters of 2019. The credit received during 2019 partially offset an increase in total assessment expense when comparing to the full year of 2018, primarily due the year-over-year increase in total average assets of the Bank on which the assessment is based.
Legal and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $562,000 or 50 percent compared to the same period in 2018 due to the increased size of the franchise and related expanded use and increased costs of third-party providers for information technology support, human resources services, external audit, and loan review services.
Software licensing and utilization costs were $4,394,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $785,000 or 22 percent compared to $3,609,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The year-over-year increase is a result of additional transaction volume-based costs and licensing fees related to the addition of the locations, staff and accounts for the First Priority offices acquired in July 2018, the expansion of the mortgage banking division during 2019, and the addition of the Hazle Township branch added in 2019. Additionally, Mid Penn continued to invest in upgrades to internal systems, networks, storage capabilities, and data security mechanisms to enhance data management and security capabilities responsive to both the larger company profile and increasing complexity of information technology management.
Intangible amortization increased from $1,224,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1,430,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the full-year impact of amortization resulting from the core deposit intangible asset added from the First Priority acquisition on July 31, 2018.
Other expenses were $4,009,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2,632,000 or 52 percent compared to other expense of $2,632,000 for the same period in 2018. As the First Priority acquisition and organic growth have significantly increased the organization’s geographic profile and employee base, several categories within other expense experienced related increases, including stationery and supplies, postage, printing, subscriptions, and employee relations.
No merger expenses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, merger and acquisition expenses totaling $4,790,000 were recorded including investment banking fees, merger-related legal and professional fees, severance costs, and information technology conversion/termination costs incurred for the two 2018 acquisitions of First Priority and Scottdale.
Investments
Mid Penn’s investment portfolio is utilized primarily to support overall liquidity and interest rate risk management, to provide collateral supporting pledging requirements for public funds on deposit, and to generate additional interest income within reasonable risk parameters. Mid Penn’s investment portfolio includes both held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities.
Mid Penn’s portfolio of held-to-maturity securities, recorded at amortized cost, decreased $8,185,000 to $128,292,000 as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $136,477,000 as of December 31, 2019. Mid Penn’s total available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased $31,261,000 or 84 percent, from $37,009,000 at December 31, 2019 to $5,748,000 at December 31, 2020. The year ended December 31, 2020 reflected a higher volume of calls of both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities as market yields dropped due to both changes in the yield curve and from the FOMC reducing rates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to certain U.S. Agencies and other security issuers to execute calls on some higher coupon securities. Additionally, Mid Penn initiated some sales of available-for-sale investment securities for both strategic portfolio and asset liability management objectives.
The debt securities in Mid Penn’s available-for-sale portfolio are recorded at fair value, which is generally based upon a market price relative to other debt investments of the same type with similar maturity dates. As the interest rate environment and overall market yield curve changes, the fair value of securities changes accordingly. The fair values of securities can also be impacted by changing market supply and demand for certain types of securities.
At December 31, 2020, the unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities resulted in a decrease in shareholders’ equity of $2,000 (comprised of a gross unrealized loss on securities of $3,000 net of a deferred income tax benefit of $1,000). At December 31, 2019, the unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities resulted in a decrease in shareholders’ equity of $127,000 (comprised of a gross unrealized loss on securities of $161,000 net of a deferred income tax benefit of $34,000). Mid Penn does not have any significant concentrations of non-governmental securities within its investment portfolio.

Loans
Total loans at December 31, 2020 were $2,384,041,000 compared to $1,762,756,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $621,285,000 or 35 percent since year-end 2019. Much of the growth is attributable to the funding of PPP loans during the second and third quarters of 2020, with $388,313,000 of PPP loans still outstanding as of December 31, 2020, net of deferred PPP processing fees of $7,746,000. The annual loan growth also reflects an increase of $232,972,000 in core (non-PPP) loans, or a 13 percent organic loan growth rate, primarily in commercial real estate credits, and commercial and industrial loans.
At December 31, 2020, loans (net of unearned income) represented 85 percent of earning assets, compared to 86 percent and 85 percent at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The majority of the Bank's loan portfolio is to businesses and individuals located within the Bank's primary market area of the Pennsylvania counties of Berks, Bucks, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Fayette, Lancaster, Luzerne, Montgomery, Northumberland, Schuylkill and Westmoreland. Commercial real estate, construction, and land development loans are collateralized mainly by mortgages on the income-producing real estate or land involved. Commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans are primarily made to business entities and may be secured by business assets, including commercial real estate, or may be unsecured. Residential real estate loans are secured by liens on the residential property. Consumer loans include installment loans, lines of credit and home equity loans. The Bank has no significant concentration of credit to any one borrower. The Bank’s highest concentration of credit by loan type is in commercial real estate financings.
A distribution of the Bank's loan portfolio according to major loan classification is shown in Table 8, and the maturity and rate sensitivity information related to the loan portfolio is reflected in Table 9.

Credit Quality, Credit Risk, and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
Other than as described herein, Mid Penn does not believe there are current significant credit-related trends, events or uncertainties relating to its loan portfolio that are reasonably expected to have a material impact on future results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Mid Penn recognizes that the effects of current and past economic conditions and other unfavorable business conditions, including the potential impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may eventually adversely influence certain borrowers’ abilities to comply with their repayment terms. Mid Penn regularly monitors the financial strength of its borrowers, including those at higher risk of credit stress from the pandemic or its economic effects, and does not engage in practices which may be used to artificially shield certain borrowers from the negative economic or business cycle effects that may compromise their ability to repay. Mid Penn does not normally structure construction loans with interest reserve components, or perform commercial real estate or other type of loan workouts whereby an existing loan was restructured into multiple new loans. Also, Mid Penn does not extend loans at maturity solely due to the existence of guarantees, without recognizing the credit as impaired. While the existence of a guarantee may be a mitigating factor in determining the proper level of allowance once impairment has been identified, the guarantee does not affect the impairment analysis.
TABLE 10: NONPERFORMING ASSETS
Mid Penn assesses a specific allocation for both commercial loans and commercial real estate loans prior to partially or fully charging off the loan. If a partial charge off is taken, the remaining balance remains a nonperforming loan with the original terms and interest rate intact and is not treated as a restructured credit.
Foreclosed real estate decreased $62,000 from $196,000 at December 31, 2019 to $134,000 at December 31, 2020, driven by the sale of several smaller foreclosed real estate properties in 2020. During 2020, nonperforming loans increased $3,487,000 from $12,157,000 at December 31, 2019, to $15,644,000 at December 31, 2020. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily the result of one loan relationship totaling $2,331,000 being reclassified to nonaccrual status (see Loan relationship no. 2 below).
Loan relationship no. 1 - At December 31, 2020, the contractual outstanding principal balance of this nonaccrual loan relationship was $7,354,000 and consisted of two commercial and industrial loans and one commercial real estate credit acquired in 2018 which were transferred from accrual to nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2019. Given that the fair value of the collateral, primarily comprised of a significant amount of commercial real estate, exceeds the outstanding principal balance, no specific allowance allocation has been currently assigned to this relationship. Management is diligently pursuing its full rights given its priority liens to the collateral under the loan agreements to collect the remaining outstanding balance.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Loan relationship no. 2 -The contractual outstanding principal balance of this nonaccrual loan relationship was $2,331,000 and was comprised of two loans acquired in 2018. These loans were transferred from accrual to nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2020. These loans are collateralized primarily by commercial real estate, and, given that the fair value of the remaining collateral exceeds the outstanding principal balance, no specific allowance allocation has been currently assigned to this relationship. Management expects to recover the remaining outstanding balance through the sale of real estate collateral pledged in support of the loans.
Mid Penn’s troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2020 totaled $1,479,000 of which $463,000 were accruing loans in compliance with the terms of the modification and $1,017,000 are included in the balance of total nonaccrual loans.
Mid Penn entered into forbearance agreements on all loans currently classified as troubled debt restructured loans, and these agreements have resulted in additional principal repayment. The terms of these forbearance agreements vary and may include reductions in principal payments, reductions in interest rates, and/or repayment of the loan as collateral is sold.
Further discussion of troubled debt restructured loans can be found in Note 7, Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, within Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2020, there were no defaulted troubled debt restructured loans, as all troubled debt restructured loans were current with respect to their associated forbearance agreements.
The following table provides additional analysis of partially charged off loans:
TABLE 11: PARTIALLY CHARGED OFF LOANS
Mid Penn has not experienced any additional charge-offs on loans for which a partial charge-off had originally been taken during the periods presented.
Mid Penn considers a commercial loan or commercial real estate loan to be impaired when it becomes 90 days or more past due and the collection efforts indicate that receipt of all contractual amounts due is not probable. Impairment may occur before a 90-day or more period of delinquency when it is probable, based upon the facts and circumstances, that Mid Penn will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due. This methodology assumes the borrower cannot or will not continue to make additional payments. At that time, the loan would likely be considered collateral dependent as the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method would indicate no operating income is available to add to the respective loan’s collateral position; therefore, most impaired loans are deemed to be collateral dependent.
Mid Penn evaluates loans for charge-off on a monthly basis. Policies that govern the recommendation for charge-off are unique to the type of loan being considered. Commercial loans rated as nonaccrual or lower will first have a collateral evaluation completed in accordance with the guidance on impaired loans. Once the collateral evaluation has been completed, a specific allocation of allowance is made based upon the results of the evaluation. The balance remains a nonperforming loan with the original terms and interest rate intact (not restructured). In the event the loan is unsecured, the loan would have been charged-off at the recognition of impairment. Commercial real estate loans rated as impaired will also have an initial collateral evaluation completed in accordance with the guidance on impaired loans. An updated real estate valuation is ordered and the collateral evaluation is modified to reflect any variation in value. A specific allocation of allowance is made for any anticipated collateral shortfall. The balance remains a nonperforming loan with the original terms and interest rate intact (not restructured). The process of charge-off for residential mortgage loans begins upon a loan becoming delinquent for 90 days and not in the process of collection. The existing appraisal is

reviewed and a lien search is obtained to determine lien position and any instances of intervening liens. A new appraisal of the property will be ordered if deemed necessary by management and a collateral evaluation is completed. The loan will then be charged down to the value indicated in the evaluation. Consumer loans are recommended for charge-off after reaching delinquency of 90 days and the loan is not in the process of collection. The collateral shortfall of the consumer loan is recommended for charge-off at this point.
As noted above, Mid Penn assesses a specific allocation for both commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The balance remains a nonperforming loan with the original terms and interest rate intact (not restructured). In addition, Mid Penn takes a preemptive step when any commercial loan or commercial real estate loan becomes classified under its internal classification system. A preliminary collateral evaluation in accordance with the guidance on impaired loans is prepared using the existing collateral information in the loan file. This process allows Mid Penn to review both the credit and documentation files to determine the status of the information needed to make a collateral evaluation. This collateral evaluation is preliminary, but allows Mid Penn to determine if any potential collateral shortfalls exist.
Larger groups of small-balance loans, such as residential mortgages and consumer installment loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, individual consumer and residential loans are not separately identified for impairment disclosures unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement.
Mid Penn’s loan rating system assumes any loans classified as substandard nonaccrual to be impaired, and most of these loans are considered collateral dependent; therefore, most of Mid Penn’s impaired loans, whether reporting a specific allocation or not, are considered collateral dependent.
It is Mid Penn’s policy to obtain updated third-party valuations on all impaired loans collateralized by real estate as soon as practicable following the credit being classified as substandard non-accrual. Prior to receipt of the updated real estate valuation Mid Penn will use any existing real estate valuation to determine any potential allowance issues; however, no allowance recommendation will be made until such time as Mid Penn is in receipt of the updated valuation. The Asset Recovery department employs an electronic tracking system to monitor the receipt of and need for updated appraisals. To date, there have been no material time lapses noted with the above processes.
In some instances, Mid Penn is not holding real estate as collateral and is relying on business assets (personal property) for repayment. In these circumstances, a collateral inspection is performed by Mid Penn personnel to determine an estimated value. The value is based on net book value, as provided by the financial statements, and discounted accordingly based on determinations made by management. Occasionally, Mid Penn will employ an outside service to provide a fair estimate of value based on auction or private sales. Management reviews the estimates of these third parties and discounts them accordingly based on management’s judgment, if deemed necessary.
For impaired loans with no valuation allowance required, Mid Penn’s practice of obtaining independent third party market valuations on the subject property as soon as practicable following being placed on nonaccrual status sometimes indicates that the loan to value ratio is sufficient to obviate the need for a specific allocation, despite significant deterioration in real estate values in Mid Penn’s primary market area. These circumstances are determined on a case by case analysis of the impaired loans.
Mid Penn actively monitors the values of collateral on impaired loans. This monitoring may require the modification of collateral values over time or changing circumstances by some factor, either positive or negative, from the original values. All collateral values will be assessed by management at least every 12 months for possible revaluation by an independent third party.
Mid Penn had loans with an aggregate balance of $15,510,000 which were deemed by management to be impaired at December 31, 2020, including $1,742,000 in loans from previous mergers which were acquired with credit deterioration. Of the $13,768,000 of impaired loan relationships excluding the loans acquired with credit deterioration, $1,452,000 were commercial and industrial relationships, $9,102,000 were commercial real estate relationships, $818,000 were residential relationships, $31,000 were commercial real estate - construction relationships, and $2,365,000 were home equity relationships. As of December 31, 2020, there were specific loan loss reserve allocations of $533,000 against the commercial and industrial relationships and $274,000 against the commercial real estate relationships. Management currently believes that the specific reserves are adequate to cover probable future losses related to these relationships.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established in the form of a provision expense for loan and lease losses and is reduced by loan charge-offs net of recoveries. In addition to a loan review function that operates independently of the lending function, management monitors the loan portfolio at least monthly to identify changes to the credit risks in the portfolio so that an appropriate allowance is maintained. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, management presents a monthly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses to the Board of Directors, indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review. In making the evaluation, management considers the results of recent regulatory examinations, which typically include a review of the allowance for loan and lease losses as an integral part of the examination process. As part of the examination process, federal or state regulatory agencies may require Mid Penn to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management.
In establishing the allowance, management evaluates on a quantitative basis individual classified loans and nonaccrual loans, and determines an aggregate reserve for those loans based on that review. In addition, an allowance for the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio is determined based on historical loss experience, adjusted by qualitative factors determined by management, within certain components of the portfolio.
This determination inherently involves a higher degree of subjectivity, and considers risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in historical loss experience. These factors include:
•
changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments;
•
changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;
•
changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans;
•
changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;
•
changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses;
•
changes in the quality of the institution's loan review system;
•
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans;
•
the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution's existing portfolio; and
•
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.
While the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level believed to be adequate by management to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates and consideration of the above-noted qualitative factors which may be susceptible to significant change. Changes in these estimates may impact the provisions charged to expense in future periods. Management believes, based on information currently available, that the allowance for loan and lease losses of $13,382,000 as of December 31, 2020 is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable.
The allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses among the major classifications is shown in Table 12 as of December 31 of each of the past five years.
TABLE 12: ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES
The increase in the allowance balance was the result of both organic loan growth during 2020, and from increases in the values of qualitative factors for both economic conditions and external factors given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic impact. Management continues to monitor the portfolio very closely for pandemic-related stresses. See also the discussion in the Provision for Loan and Lease Losses section.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2020 was $13,382,000 or 0.56% of total loans (less unearned discount), as compared to $9,515,000 or 0.54% at December 31, 2019, and $8,397,000 or 0.52% at December 31, 2018.
Deposits and Other Funding Sources
Mid Penn's primary source of funds are retail deposits from businesses, public funds depositors, and consumers in its market area. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total deposits increased by $562,186,000 or over 29 percent. Deposits as of year-end 2019 had increased by $186,386,000 or 11 percent since December 31, 2018. Deposit growth during the year ended December 31, 2020 was led by substantial increases in noninterest-bearing balances and money market deposits, primarily due to both new and expanded cash management and commercial deposit account relationships, including those from new customers established as a result of Mid Penn’s PPP loan activities. Deposit growth from year-end 2018 to year-end 2019 was led by increases in money market deposits and noninterest-bearing balances, primarily due to both new and expanded cash management and commercial deposit account relationships. Average balances and average interest rates applicable to the classifications of deposits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are presented in Table 13.
Mid Penn had no brokered time deposits as of December 31, 2020, compared to $13,326,000 in brokered time deposits at December 31, 2019 and $56,188,000 as of December 31, 2018. The decrease in brokered certificates of deposits during both 2019 and 2020 was the result of brokered certificates of deposit assumed in the First Priority and Phoenix acquisitions which matured and were not replaced.
TABLE 13: DEPOSITS BY MAJOR CLASSIFICATION
The maturity distribution of time deposits of $100,000 or more is reflected in Table 14.
TABLE 14: MATURITY OF TIME DEPOSITS $100,000 OR MORE
Short-term borrowings of $125,617,000 at December 31, 2020 consisted entirely of Mid Penn’s utilization of the Federal Reserve’s PPPLF. The PPPLF allows banks to pledge PPP loans as collateral to borrow funds for up to a term of five years (to match the term of the respective PPP loans) at an interest rate of 0.35 percent. Mid Penn held no short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank had long-term debt outstanding in the amount of $75,115,000 and $32,903,000, respectively, consisting primarily of FHLB fixed rate advances as well as a finance lease liability executed in 2019.
Capital Resources
Shareholders' equity, or capital, is evaluated in relation to total assets and the risk associated with those assets. The detailed computation of Mid Penn’s regulatory capital ratios can be found in Note 19, Regulatory Matters, within Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The greater the Corporation’s capital resources, the more likely it is to meet its cash obligations and absorb unforeseen losses. Capital management practices have been, and will continue to be, of paramount importance to the Corporation in support of both its regulatory capital requirements and its shareholders.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Shareholders’ equity increased by $17,814,000 or 7 percent from $237,874,000 as of December 31, 2019 to $255,688,000 as of December 31, 2020. The increase in shareholders’ equity primarily reflects the growth in retained earnings through year-to-date net income, net of dividends paid and declared. Some of the year-over-year increase in shareholders’ equity was offset by the initiation of Mid Penn’s treasury stock repurchase program, which reflected total common stock buybacks of $1,795,000 as of December 31, 2020. A total of 92,652 common shares were repurchased at a discount to tangible book value per share, with an average cost of $19.37 per share.
Shareholders’ equity increased by $14,664,000 or 7 percent from $223,209,000 as of December 31, 2018 to $237,874,000 as of December 31, 2019. The increase in shareholders’ equity during 2019 reflected (i) the growth in retained earnings through year-to-date net income of $17,701,000 net of dividends paid totaling $6,688,000, (ii) a $316,000 favorable prior period adjustment posted as part of the adoption of the new GAAP leasing standard, and (iii) other comprehensive income from the significant after-tax appreciation in the available-for-sale portfolio, much of which had been realized from securities sales during 2019.
Shareholders’ equity more than doubled, from $75,703,000 at December 31, 2017 to $223,209,000 at December 31, 2018, primarily due to (i) the issuance of 1,878,827 shares of Mid Penn common stock on January 8, 2018 in connection with the acquisition of Scottdale; and (ii) the issuance of 2,320,800 shares of Mid Penn common stock on July 31, 2018, in connection with the acquisition of First Priority. Additionally, shareholders’ equity reflects the growth in retained earnings through $10,494,000 of net income available to common shareholders for 2018, less dividends declared during the year of $3,453,000. These increases were partially offset by other comprehensive losses, primarily due to the after-tax impact of the unrealized reduction in market value within the available-for-sale investment portfolio since December 31, 2017.
Mid Penn’s dividend payout philosophy looks to provide reasonable quarterly cash returns to shareholders while still retaining sufficient earnings to finance future growth and maintain sound capital levels. For additional information, see “Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities - Dividends”. Dividends paid and declared on common shares totaled $0.77 and $0.82, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Dividends paid and declared on common shares totaled $0.79 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Dividends paid and declared on common shares totaled $0.70 and $0.45, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The dividend payout ratio, which represents the percentage of annual net income returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, was 24.80% for 2020 and 37.80% for 2019.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Mid Penn maintained regulatory capital levels, leverage ratios, and risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as follows:
(a)
Minimum amounts and ratios include the full phase in of the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent required by the BASEL III framework.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Effective in the third quarter of 2018, the Federal Reserve raised the consolidated asset limit to be considered a small bank holding company from $1 billion to $3 billion. A company that qualifies as a small bank holding company is not subject to the Federal Reserve’s consolidated capital rules, although a company that so qualifies may continue to file reports that include such capital amounts and ratios. Mid Penn has elected to continue to report those amounts and ratios.

Subordinated Debt Assumed July 2018 with the First Priority Acquisition
On July 31, 2018, Mid Penn completed its acquisition of First Priority and assumed $9,500,000 of Subordinated Notes (the “First Priority Notes”). In accordance with purchase accounting principles, the First Priority Notes were assigned a fair value premium of $247,000. The notes were treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory reporting purposes.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The First Priority Notes agreements were entered into by First Priority on November 13, 2015 with five accredited investors pursuant to which First Priority issued subordinated notes totaling $9,500,000. The First Priority Notes had a maturity date of November 30, 2025, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.00% per annum. The Notes were non-callable for an initial period of five years and included provisions for redemption pricing between 101.5% and 100.5% of the liquidation value if called after five years but prior to the stated maturity date.
On December 18, 2020, Mid Penn redeemed the $9,500,000 of subordinated debt assumed in 2018 in conjunction with Mid Penn’s acquisition of First Priority Bank. The First Priority subordinated debt was redeemed promptly following the expiration of the noncallable period and after receiving the required regulatory approval for the redemption. Mid Penn recognized redemption pricing fees of $143,000 related to the early redemption, which are included in other noninterest expenses.
Subordinated Debt Issued December 2017

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Series D Preferred Stock
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 16, 2018 between Mid Penn and First Priority (the “Merger Agreement”), each share of First Priority Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the “First Priority Preferred Stock”) outstanding as of July 31, 2018 was converted into the right to receive one share of Mid Penn Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, having a $1,000 liquidation preference per share (the “Mid Penn Preferred Stock”). In connection with the First Priority Merger, Mid Penn issued 3,404 shares of Mid Penn Preferred Stock totaling $3,404,000.
The terms of the Mid Penn Preferred Stock were no less favorable than those of the First Priority Preferred Stock as in effect immediately prior to the Merger. The Mid Penn Preferred Stock was redeemable at the option of Mid Penn, subject to the prior receipt of any requisite regulatory approval.
Dividends were payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. The dividend rate on the Mid Penn Preferred Stock was fixed at 9%.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank approved Mid Penn’s request to redeem all 3,404 shares of Mid Penn Preferred Stock at the $1,000 liquidation value. The redemption of the $3,404,000 of the Mid Penn Preferred Stock was completed and the final dividend payment was made on December 14, 2018. Accordingly, no preferred stock was outstanding, and no preferred dividends were paid, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Preferred dividends of $102,000 were paid in 2018.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $5,130,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,405,000 or 38 percent compared to $3,725,000 for the same period in 2019. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects an effective Federal tax rate of 16.8%, compared to an effective Federal tax rate of 17.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The full-year 2020 tax provision and effective tax rate reflects (i) the impact of tax-free income earned on municipal investments and loans, (ii) the impact of certain CARES Act provisions allowing for the carryback of federal tax net operating losses (NOLs) to prior periods in which the Federal tax rate was 34 percent totaling $318,000, (iii) the full-year impact of tax credits recognized related to Mid Penn’s investment in a low-income housing project in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania totaling $861,000, and (iv) state income taxes that Mid Penn pays to the states of New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware for revenues sourced in those respective states.
Income tax expense for 2019 was $3,725,000, compared to $2,129,000 for 2018. The provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 reflects (i) an effective federal tax rate of 17.8%, with the difference from the statutory tax rate of 21% mostly related to tax-exempt income on municipal securities and loans; (ii) a favorable adjustment to federal income tax expense of $277,000 for certain permanent nonrecurring tax benefits recorded during 2019; and (iii) New Jersey income tax expense of $185,000 attributable to increased New Jersey sourced income, primarily from First Priority legacy customers. Federal income tax expense in 2018 reflects the reduction in the maximum corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent, legislated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in December 2017, with the rate change effective January 1, 2018.
Liquidity
Mid Penn's asset-liability management policy addresses the management of Mid Penn's liquidity position and its ability to raise sufficient funds to meet deposit withdrawals, fund loan growth and meet other operational needs. In addition to its cash and equivalents, Mid Penn utilizes its investments as a source of liquidity, along with deposit growth and increases in borrowings. For additional information, see Deposits and Other Funding Sources, which appears earlier in this discussion. Liquidity from investments is provided primarily through investment calls, sales of available-for-sale securities, prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, and from investments and interest-bearing balances with maturities of one year or less.
The Bank can obtain funds from overnight borrowings, short-term borrowings, and long-term borrowings from the FHLB, up to the Bank’s maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB, which was $852,568,000 at December 31, 2020. FHLB borrowings require the Bank to make certain restricted stock purchases in accordance with FHLB requirements. Borrowings with the FHLB are collateralized by certain qualifying loans and investment securities of the Bank. The Bank also has unused lines of credit with other correspondent banks amounting to $35,000,000 at December 31, 2020.
Major sources of cash in 2020 came from the $562,186,000 net increase in deposits, $348,756,000 of proceeds from sales of mortgage loans originated for sale, and proceeds from short-term PPPLF borrowings of $125,617,000.
MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Major uses of cash in 2020 were $623,153,000 to fund net portfolio loan growth (primarily commercial PPP loans), $356,158,000 to fund mortgage loans originated for sale, and $178,630,000 to fund the purchase of investment securities.
Major sources of cash in 2019 came from the $186,368,000 net increase in deposits, $160,279,000 of proceeds from sales of mortgage loans originated for sale, and $154,307,000 in proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale investments securities.
Major uses of cash in 2019 were $163,228,000 to fund mortgage loans originated for sale, $139,430,000 to fund net portfolio loan growth (primarily commercial loans) and $79,254,000 to fund the purchase of investment securities.

We are not aware of any other commitments or contingent liabilities which may have a material adverse impact on Mid Penn’s liquidity or capital resources.
Effects of Inflation
A bank's asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature. Management believes the impact of inflation on its financial results depends principally upon Mid Penn's ability to measure its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and to take appropriate actions, as needed or controllable by the Bank, to mitigate the impacts of inflation on performance. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same magnitude as the prices of other goods and services. As discussed previously, management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.
Information included elsewhere in this report will assist in the understanding of how Mid Penn is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends. In particular, the previously discussed risk factors, the composition of and yields on loans and investments, and the composition and costs of deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, should be considered.
Off-Balance Sheet Items
Mid Penn makes contractual commitments to extend credit and extends lines of credit, which are subject to Mid Penn's credit approval and monitoring procedures. As of December 31, 2020, commitments to extend credit amounted to $654,977,000 compared to $435,553,000 as of December 31, 2019.
Mid Penn also issues standby letters of credit to its customers. The risk associated with standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in loan extensions to customers. Standby letters of credit increased to $39,468,000 at December 31, 2020, from $26,574,000 at December 31, 2019.
