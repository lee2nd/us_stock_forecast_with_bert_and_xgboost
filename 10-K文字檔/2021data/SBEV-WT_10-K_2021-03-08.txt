Business Overview
Splash Beverage Group (“SBG”), f/k/a Canfield Medical Supply, Inc. (the “CMS”), was incorporated in the State of Ohio on September 3, 1992, and changed domicile to Colorado on April 18, 2012. CMS is in the business of home health services, primarily the selling of durable medical equipment and medical supplies to the public, nursing homes, hospitals and other end users.
On December 31, 2019, CMS entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SBG Acquisition Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Nevada Corporation wholly-owned by CMS, and Splash Beverage Group, Inc. a Nevada corporation (“Splash”) pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Splash (the “Merger”) with Splash as the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CMS. The Merger was consummated on March 31, 2020.
As the owners and management of Splash have voting and operating control of CMS following the Merger, the Merger transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition (that is with Splash as the acquiring entity), followed by a recapitalization.
Splash specializes in the manufacturing, distribution, and sales & marketing of various beverages across multiple channels. Splash operates in both the non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverage segments. Additionally, Splash operates its own vertically integrated B-to-B and B-to-C e-commerce distribution platform called Qplash, further expanding its distribution abilities and visibility.
In July 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Splash Beverage Group Inc. On July 31, 2020, we received approval from FINRA regarding our name change.
On December 24, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Copa di Vino Corporation an Oregon company for a purchase price of $5,980,000.
