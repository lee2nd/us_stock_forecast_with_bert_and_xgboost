The United States has been operating under a state of emergency related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic since March 13, 2020. The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction in economic activity that severely hampered the ability for businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations. The effects of the pandemic contributed to a significant increase in the Company’s provision for credit losses during 2020. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers, creates a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans, protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency, and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings to account for the effects of COVID-19. The bank regulatory agencies likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. That guidance, with concurrence of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and provisions of the CARES Act allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief, to not be treated as troubled debt restructurings nor be reported as past due. Modifications may include payment deferrals (including maturity extensions), fee waivers and covenant waivers. The Company has been working with its customers affected by COVID-19 and has granted modifications across many of its loan portfolios. To the extent that such modifications meet the criteria previously described, the modified loans have not been classified as troubled debt restructurings nor reported as past due.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company’s significant accounting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Company’s reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. The more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:
•
Accounting for credit losses - Effective January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance that impacts how the allowance for credit losses is determined. Under the new accounting guidance, the allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets, including loans and leases, to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio, borrower-specific financial data and macro-economic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. For certain loan pools
that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to estimate amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations. Such models consider historical correlations of credit losses with various macroeconomic assumptions including unemployment, gross domestic product and real estate prices. These forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases of the models. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company utilizes longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans. Prior to 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in management’s judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to 2020 did not consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that could have affected the collectability of the reported amounts. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining management’s estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods. A discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses, as well as the new accounting guidance, is included herein under the heading “Provision for Credit Losses” and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.
•
Valuation methodologies - Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations, capitalized servicing assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, estimated residual values of property associated with leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include certain investments, capitalized servicing assets, goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 18, 19 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.
•
Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements - Information regarding the Company’s commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Company’s results of operations is included in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were
inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. Information regarding the Company’s income taxes is presented in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the relative significance of the Company’s financial interests in those entities and the degree to which the Company can influence the most important activities of the entities. Information relating to the Company’s involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Overview
Net income recorded by the Company in 2020 was $1.35 billion or $9.94 of diluted earnings per common share, representing declines of 30% and 28%, respectively, from $1.93 billion or $13.75 of diluted earnings per common share in 2019. Basic earnings per common share decreased 28% to $9.94 in 2020 from $13.76 in 2019. Net income in 2018 totaled $1.92 billion, while diluted and basic earnings per common share were $12.74 and $12.75, respectively. Expressed as a rate of return on average assets, net income in 2020 was 1.00%, compared with 1.61% in 2019 and 1.64% in 2018. The return on average common shareholders’ equity was 8.72% in 2020, 12.87% in 2019 and 12.82% in 2018.
Effective January 1, 2020, M&T adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. That guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The new accounting guidance replaced the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a $132 million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020. Additional information on the new accounting guidance is provided under the heading “Provision for Credit Losses” and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Financial results for 2020 have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Large portions of the U.S. economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and, as a result, many commercial and consumer customers were adversely impacted. Specifically, those adverse economic impacts, coupled with the accounting change noted previously, resulted in the Company recognizing significantly higher provisions for credit losses during 2020 as compared with previous years. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the provision for credit losses totaled $800 million, $176 million and $132 million, respectively. The 2020 period reflects the new accounting guidance for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments. Prior to 2020, the provision for credit losses reflected incurred losses only. In response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has taken action to lower interest rates that has negatively affected the Company’s net interest income. Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.88 billion, $4.15 billion and $4.09 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The CARES Act and applicable extensions provide relief to borrowers, including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing, and also provide funding opportunities for small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) from approved Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lenders, including M&T Bank. For commercial and consumer customers, the Company has provided a host of relief options, including payment deferrals (including maturity extensions), loan covenant waivers and low interest rate loan
products. M&T Bank funded approximately $7.0 billion of PPP loans during 2020, of which $5.4 billion remained outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Updated economic forecasts at the end of each of the quarters of 2020 resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the Company’s loan portfolio than at January 1, 2020, resulting in higher levels of the provision for credit losses in each of those quarters as compared with the comparable 2019 periods. Specifically, the level of the provision in 2020 reflects the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors, the uncertainty at December 31, 2020 as to the sufficiency and effectiveness of economic stimulus provided by the U.S. government to the economy, and concerns about ultimate collectability of real estate loans where the borrowers are requesting re-payment forbearance. The Company expects that it will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic after December 31, 2020. Specifically, the Company expects that the following balance sheet and income statement categories could be affected:
• Net interest income and net interest margin - the low interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect the Company’s net interest margin;
• Provision for credit losses - although the economy has seen some signs of recovery, it is possible that deteriorating economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could result in higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses. In addition, the impact on borrowers’ ability to repay loans could be negatively affected, potentially leading to increased charge-offs;
• Significant portions of noninterest income could be adversely affected. For example, consumer deposit service charge fees may continue to be lower than historical levels due to lower customer transaction activity; credit card interchange volumes may be lower than historical norms, resulting in lower fees, until the economy returns to pre-pandemic activity levels; and portions of trust income may be reduced due to fee waivers associated with proprietary money market mutual fund management fees; and
• A resurgence of the pandemic in large parts of the country may result in government mandates that could impact customer demand for many of the Company’s credit-related products and other services.
The national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees. The Company has taken actions designed to help provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways. Examples of those actions include:
• The deployment of a Pandemic Response Plan to manage the pandemic’s effects on operations, employees and customers, including seeking to ensure employee safety, maintaining continuity of operations and service levels for customers, preserving the Company’s financial strength, and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Actions have included placing restrictions on travel, implementing social distancing, health screening, sanitation and other protocols, and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home where possible. The Company continues to assess the appropriateness of employees returning to the office while seeking to ensure a safe work environment;
• Nearly all M&T Bank branches remain open, with open lobbies and normal access to drive-through windows and ATMs;
• The vast majority of the Company’s non-branch employees continue to work remotely;
• Many loan customers are receiving COVID-19 related relief in various forms as noted herein.
• Commercial - balances of $1.7 billion, including $96 million of commercial loans and $790 million of commercial real estate loans for which a payment deferral has been requested;
• Residential real estate - balances of $2.8 billion for which a payment deferral has been requested;
• Consumer - including automobile, recreational finance, home equity lines and loans, credit cards and personal loans - balances of $97 million for which a payment deferral has been requested;
• Paycheck Protection Program - At December 31, 2020 outstanding loans totaled $5.4 billion; and
• Waiving certain types of transaction and maintenance fees for consumer and small business deposit account relationships.
When comparing the Company’s financial results in 2020 with 2019, there were several notable matters during 2019 that impacted that year’s results. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized an expense of $50 million (reflected in “other costs of operations”) to increase its reserve for legal matters associated with a subsidiary’s role as trustee of Employee Stock Ownership Plans in its Institutional Client Services business. That expense, on an after-tax basis, reduced net income by $37 million, or $.27 of diluted earnings per common share. Also during that quarter, M&T received a $37 million distribution from Bayview Lending Group LLC (“BLG”), increasing net income by $28 million, or $.20 of diluted earnings per common share. Similar distributions received in 2020 totaled $53 million, increasing net income by $40 million, or $.31 of diluted earnings per common share.
In July 2019, M&T agreed to sell its non-controlling interest in an asset manager obtained in the 2011 acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation (“WT Corp.”) that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, as a result, as of June 30, 2019 recorded a $48 million charge (reflected in “other costs of operations”) to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated net realizable value. Similar to other active investment managers, the investee entity had experienced a decrease in assets under management and during the second quarter of 2019 the entity’s chief executive and investment officer announced his retirement. Following that announcement, successor management submitted a proposal to M&T to restructure the organization of the entity. The after-tax impact of the charge was a reduction in net income of $36 million, or $.27 of diluted earnings per common share. The sale of M&T’s interest in the asset manager was effective September 30, 2019.
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new accounting guidance for leases. The new guidance requires lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases with a term greater than twelve months. The accounting applied by lessors is largely unchanged, however, the guidance eliminates the accounting model for leveraged leases that commenced after December 31, 2018. The Company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements which, prior to January 1, 2019, were not reflected in its consolidated balance sheet. As of January 1, 2019, the Company recorded right-of-use assets of $394 million and increased lease liabilities of $399 million in its consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated statement of income during 2019. For additional information on leases, see notes 3 and 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.
There were also several notable items in 2018. The Company adopted amended accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 to separately report equity securities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet (which were previously reported as investment securities available for sale) with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income rather than through other comprehensive income. Net unrealized gains on investments in equity securities in 2019 totaled $18 million, compared with net unrealized losses of $9 million in 2020 and $6 million in 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the Company increased its reserve for legal matters by $135 million in anticipation of the settlement of a civil litigation matter by WT Corp. that related to periods prior
to the acquisition of WT Corp. by M&T. The increase, on an after-tax basis, reduced net income by $102 million or $.71 of diluted earnings per common share in 2018. That matter received final court approval and was settled in 2018.
Reflecting the matters discussed previously, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $3.88 billion in 2020, 6% lower than $4.15 billion in 2019. That decline resulted from a 68 basis point (hundredths of one percent) narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets, to 3.16% in 2020 from 3.84% in 2019, partially offset by the impact of an increase in average earning assets to $122.9 billion in 2020 from $108.2 billion in 2019. Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 1% in 2019 from $4.09 billion in 2018. That improvement resulted predominantly from an increase in average earning assets in 2019 from $106.8 billion in 2018 and a slight expansion of the net interest margin from 3.83% in 2018.
The provision for credit losses rose significantly to $800 million in 2020 from $176 million in 2019. The provision in 2018 was $132 million. Net charge-offs in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $247 million, $144 million and $130 million, respectively.
Other income aggregated $2.09 billion and $2.06 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared with $1.86 billion in 2018. Comparing 2020 with 2019, a 24% rise in mortgage banking revenues, higher trust income and increased income from BLG in 2020 were partially offset by declines in service charges on deposit accounts, trading account and foreign exchange gains and loan syndication fees. As compared with 2018, growth in 2019 was experienced in most major sources of noninterest income, led by higher residential and commercial mortgage banking revenues and trust income.
Other expense decreased 2% to $3.39 billion in 2020 from $3.47 billion in 2019. Other expense in 2018 totaled $3.29 billion. Included in those amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be “nonoperating” in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $15 million, $19 million and $25 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses totaled $3.37 billion in 2020, compared with $3.45 billion in 2019 and $3.26 billion in 2018. Contributing to the lower level of such expenses in 2020 as compared with 2019 were decreased costs for professional and outside services, legal-related matters, advertising and marketing, travel and entertainment, and a $48 million charge in the second quarter of 2019 associated with the sale of an equity investment in an asset manager. Those factors were partially offset by higher costs for salaries and employee benefits, outside data processing and software, increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and $14 million of expenses related to the planned transition of the support for the Company’s retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of LPL Financial. The higher level of noninterest operating expenses in 2019 as compared with 2018 resulted from increased costs for salaries and employee benefits, equipment and net occupancy, outside data processing and software, and professional services, and the $48 million charge associated with the sale of the equity investment in an asset manager. Those factors were partially offset by lower costs associated with legal-related matters and contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation, and a decline in FDIC assessments.
The efficiency ratio measures the relationship of noninterest operating expenses to revenues. The Company’s efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses (as previously defined) divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 56.3% in 2020, compared with 55.7% and 54.8% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The calculations of the efficiency ratio are presented in table 2.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 23.5% in each of 2020 and 2018 and 24.3% in 2019.

Interest income data are on a taxable-equivalent basis. The taxable-equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 26% in 2018-2020 and 39% in prior years.
Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations
As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $4.6 billion at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019, consisting predominantly of goodwill. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after-tax effect, totaled $11 million, $14 million and $18 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a “net operating” or “tangible” basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and gains (when realized) and expenses (when incurred) associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such items are considered by management to be “nonoperating” in nature. There were no such merger-related gains or expenses in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Although “net operating income” as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T’s management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.
Net operating income was $1.36 billion in 2020 and $1.94 billion in each of 2019 and 2018. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $10.02 in 2020, $13.86 in 2019 and $12.86 in 2018.
Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.04% in 2020, compared with 1.69% in 2019 and 1.72% in 2018. Net operating income represented a return on average tangible common equity of 12.79% in 2020, compared with 19.08% in 2019 and 19.09% in 2018.
Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in table 2.

Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities
Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis aggregated $3.88 billion in 2020, down 6% from $4.15 billion in 2019. That decline primarily resulted from a 68 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin, largely the result of declines in yields on loans and balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the Federal Reserve to decrease its target Federal funds rate three times in the second half of 2019 (each by a .25% increment) and twice in March of 2020 (first by .50%, then another by 1.0%). The lower net interest margin was partially offset by the impact of a $14.6 billion, or 14%, increase in average earning assets to $122.9 billion in 2020 from $108.2 billion in 2019 that reflected increases in average loan and lease balances of $7.1 billion and in interest-bearing deposits at banks of $8.5 billion, partially offset by a decline in average balances of investment securities of $3.4 billion.
Average loans and leases rose 8% to $96.6 billion in 2020 from $89.5 billion in 2019. Average balances of commercial loans and leases increased $4.2 billion or 18% to $27.5 billion in 2020 from $23.3 billion in 2019. That increase was the result of average outstanding PPP loans of $4.4 billion that were predominantly funded in the second quarter of 2020. Average commercial real estate loan balances were up $2.1 billion or 6% to $37.0 billion in 2020 from $34.9 billion in 2019. Consumer loans averaged $15.9 billion in 2020, up $1.2 billion or 9% from $14.6 billion in 2019, due to growth in recreational finance loans (consisting predominantly of loans secured by recreational vehicles and boats) and, to a lesser extent, automobile loans that was partially offset by declines in outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit. Average residential real estate loans were $16.2 billion and $16.7 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting the ongoing repayments of loans by customers, partially offset by repurchases of government-guaranteed loans from Ginnie Mae pools that are serviced by the Company. The Company repurchases government-guaranteed loans to reduce associated servicing costs, namely a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors, including payments deferred under COVID-19 forbearance arrangements. The loans repurchased from Ginnie Mae pools averaged $2.6 billion in 2020, up from $889 million in 2019.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income in 2019 was up 1% from $4.09 billion in 2018. That growth resulted from a $1.5 billion or 1% increase in average earning assets to $108.2 billion in 2019 from $106.8 billion in 2018 that reflected increases in average loan and lease balances of $2.1 billion and in interest-bearing deposits at banks of $1.2 billion, partially offset by a decline in average balances of investment securities of $2.1 billion. Also contributing to the improvement was a widening of the net interest margin to 3.84% in 2019 from 3.83% in 2018.
Average loans and leases rose $2.1 billion, or 2%, in 2019 from $87.4 billion in 2018. Average balances of commercial loans and leases increased $1.5 billion or 7% to $23.3 billion in 2019 from $21.8 billion in 2018. Average commercial real estate loan balances were up $1.2 billion or 4% to $34.9 billion in 2019 from $33.7 billion in 2018. Consumer loans averaged $14.6 billion in 2019, up $1.1 billion or 8% from $13.6 billion in 2018, due to growth in recreational finance loans and automobile loans that was partially offset by declines in outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit. Average residential real estate loans declined $1.7 billion or 9% to $16.7 billion in 2019 from $18.3 billion in 2018, predominantly due to ongoing repayments of loans obtained in the 2015 acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (“Hudson City”).

Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate, totaled $27.6 billion at December 31, 2020, representing 28% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents information on commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2020 relating to geographic area, size, borrower industry and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $27.6 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2020, approximately $19.9 billion, or 72%, were secured, while 36%, 18% and 30% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and in the Mid-Atlantic area (which includes Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia), respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2020 aggregated $1.1 billion, of which 48% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 14% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania and another 18% were secured by collateral in the Mid-Atlantic area.

International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $100 million and $121 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in such loans were $94 million and $93 million, respectively, of loans at M&T Bank’s commercial banking office in Ontario, Canada. The remaining international loans are predominantly to domestic companies with foreign operations.
Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 59% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2020, compared with 63% and 65% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately $37.6 billion of commercial real estate loans (including $278 million originated for sale), $16.8 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties (including $777 million of loans originated for sale) and $4.0 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $35.5 billion, $16.2 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Included in commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were construction loans of $10.0 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, including amounts due from builders and developers of residential real estate aggregating $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Commercial real estate loans included loans held for sale totaling $278 million and $28 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. International loans included in commercial real estate loans totaled $60 million at December 31, 2020 and $54 million at December 31, 2019.
Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include both fixed and variable rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity. Maturity dates generally range from five to ten years and, for borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer following maturity at the then-current market rate of interest. Adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 74% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio at the 2020 year-end. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2020. New York City area commercial real estate loans totaled $9.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The $8.3 billion of investor-owned commercial real estate loans in the New York City area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties, retail space and office space. The Company’s experience has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 66% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $30 million or less, while loans of more than $50 million made up approximately 19% of the total.
Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business (owner-occupied). Approximately 91% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $30 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, approximately 82% and 76%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $30 million or less.
Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and New York State comprised 21% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2020.

Includes $351 million of construction loans.
Commercial real estate construction and development loans made to investors presented in table 6 totaled $9.6 billion at December 31, 2020, or 10% of total loans and leases. Approximately 93% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at the 2020 year-end were $1.3 billion of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multifamily residential housing, retail space and other commercial development.
M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a commercial real estate lending subsidiary of M&T Bank, participates in the Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS”) program of Fannie Mae, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. The Company’s maximum credit risk for recourse associated with sold commercial real estate loans was approximately $4.0 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, commercial real estate loans serviced by the Company for other investors were $22.2 billion and $21.0 billion, respectively. Reflected in commercial real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others that had outstanding balances of $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties were $16.8 billion at December 31, 2020, including approximately 36% secured by properties located in New York State, 7% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania, 20% secured by properties in New Jersey and 15% secured by properties located in other Mid-Atlantic areas. Included in residential real estate loans were loans repurchased by the Company from Ginnie Mae pools as previously described. Those repurchased loans totaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $807 million at December 31, 2019. The Company’s portfolio of limited documentation residential real estate loans held for investment totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020, down from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019. That portfolio consisted predominantly of limited documentation loans acquired with the Hudson City transaction. Such loans represent loans that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional residential real estate loans. Hudson City loans that were eligible for limited documentation processing were available in amounts up to 65% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the property. Hudson City discontinued its limited documentation loan program in January 2014. Loans to individuals to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties totaled $77 million at December 31, 2020 and $94 million at December 31, 2019, or approximately .1% of total loans and leases at each of those dates. Information about the credit performance of the Company’s residential real estate loans is included herein under the heading “Provision For Credit Losses.”
Consumer loans comprised approximately 17% of total loans and leases at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Outstanding balances of recreational finance loans represented the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and totaled $7.1 billion or approximately 7% of total loans, up from $5.5 billion or 6% at December 31, 2019. That growth reflects increased consumer demand for such loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $4.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Approximately 40% of home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020 were secured by properties in New York State, 23% in Maryland, 21% in Pennsylvania and 4% in New Jersey. Outstanding automobile loan balances rose to $4.1 billion at
December 31, 2020 from $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019. That increase reflects continued consumer demand for motor vehicles.
Table 7 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2020, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other states.

Includes Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
The investment securities portfolio averaged $8.2 billion in 2020, down from $11.6 billion and $13.7 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decline in average balances of investment securities in 2020 and 2019 was predominantly due to maturities and pay downs of mortgage-backed securities and maturities of U.S. Treasury notes. There were no significant purchases of investment securities during 2020. During 2019 and 2018, the Company purchased $500 million and $450 million, respectively, of U.S. Treasury notes. Sales of investment securities were not significant in 2020, 2019 or 2018. The Company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on the amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities.
The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its liquidity position and its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. The Company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual
or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination. The amounts of investment securities held by the Company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments, demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.
Fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Net unrealized losses on such equity securities were $9 million in 2020 and $6 million in 2018, compared with net unrealized gains of $18 million in 2019. Those gains and losses were predominantly related to the Company’s holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock.
The Company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of credit-related losses. In light of such reviews, there were no credit-related losses on debt investment securities recognized in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Based on management’s assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of December 31, 2020, the Company did not expect to incur any material credit-related losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities. A further discussion of fair values of investment securities is included herein under the heading “Capital.” Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes 2 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Other earning assets include interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $18.1 billion in 2020, $7.2 billion in 2019 and $5.7 billion in 2018. Interest-bearing deposits at banks averaged $15.3 billion in 2020, compared with $6.8 billion in 2019 and $5.6 billion in 2018. The amounts of interest-bearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trust-related deposits of commercial entities, purchases or maturities of investment securities, or borrowings to manage the Company’s liquidity. The higher amount in 2020 as compared with 2019 and 2018 reflects increased commercial and consumer deposit balances. Agreements to resell securities averaged $2.7 billion and $327 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Holdings of agreements to resell securities were insignificant during 2018. The higher average balance in 2020 reflects the temporary investment by the Company of increased customer deposit levels.
The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits. The Company considers noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less as core deposits. The Company’s branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Average core deposits were $105.7 billion in 2020, compared with $87.9 billion in 2019 and $87.3 billion in 2018. Average balances of savings and interest-checking core deposits rose $7.9 billion or 15% in 2020 to $59.8 billion from $51.9 billion in 2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $10.9 billion or 35% to $41.7 billion in 2020 from $30.8 billion in 2019. Those increases were largely due to higher average deposits of commercial customers, but also reflect higher levels of consumer deposits and deposits associated with residential mortgage servicing activities. The higher commercial deposits reflect liquidity and economic concerns of customers resulting in continued deposit retention. Average core deposits in 2019 were up 1% as compared with 2018. Average savings and interest-checking core deposit balances rose $1.7 billion or 3% in 2019 from $50.1 billion in 2018. That increase was predominantly due to higher residential mortgage escrow deposits, resulting from additions to the Company’s servicing and sub-servicing portfolios in 2019, and higher commercial and trust deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2019 declined $1.1 billion or 4% from $31.9 million in 2018. Contributing to that decline were lower deposits associated with commercial and trust customers, partially offset by higher
mortgage escrow deposits. The lower commercial deposits were largely due to a shift of such deposits from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing products. Funding provided by core deposits represented 86% of average earning assets in 2020, compared with 81% in 2019 and 82% in 2018. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2020 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. Core deposits totaled $114.2 billion and $89.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Table 8
AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS
The Company also receives funding from other deposit sources, including branch-related time deposits over $250,000, deposits associated with the Company’s Cayman Islands office, and brokered deposits. Time deposits over $250,000, excluding brokered deposits, averaged $683 million in 2020, $956 million in 2019 and $675 million in 2018. The decline in such deposits from 2019 to 2020 was predominantly the result of maturities of time deposits and, due to the low interest rate environment, a reduced demand from customers for time deposit products. The increase in such deposits from 2018 to 2019 was predominantly the result of the generally higher interest rate environment in 2019 and customers’ desire to earn a higher return on their deposits. Cayman Islands office deposits averaged $1.1 billion in 2020, $1.4 billion in 2019 and $394 million in 2018. The decrease in such deposits in 2020 as compared with 2019 reflects customer reaction to the declines in short-term interest rates that followed actions by the Federal Reserve in March 2020. The increase in such deposits in 2019 from 2018 resulted from customers’ desire to sweep their deposit balances into the then higher earning products. The Company had brokered savings and interest-bearing transaction accounts that averaged $3.8 billion in 2020, $2.7 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018. Brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding in any of the three years discussed herein. Additional amounts of Cayman Islands office deposits or brokered deposits may be added in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.
Table 9 summarizes average total deposits for 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Table 9
AVERAGE DEPOSITS
The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the FHLB of New York, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings represent arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less. Average short-term borrowings were $62 million in 2020, $1.1 billion in 2019 and $331 million in 2018.
Long-term borrowings averaged $5.8 billion in 2020, $7.7 billion in 2019 and $8.8 billion in 2018. Average balances of outstanding senior notes were $3.8 billion in 2020, compared with $5.3 billion and $5.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Unsecured senior notes totaled $2.8 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020, M&T Bank redeemed $2.1 billion of fixed rate senior notes that were within thirty days of scheduled maturity and, thereby, eligible for redemption. During January 2018, M&T Bank issued $650 million of 2.625% fixed rate and $350 million of variable rate senior notes that pay interest quarterly and are indexed to the three-month LIBOR. The variable rate notes mature in 2021 and the fixed rate notes that were due to mature on January 25, 2021 were redeemed on December 28, 2020. On December 31, 2018, M&T Bank redeemed $750 million of fixed rate senior notes that were due to mature on January 31, 2019. In addition, in July 2018 M&T issued $750 million of senior notes that mature in July 2023, of which $500 million have a 3.55% fixed interest rate and $250 million have a variable rate paid quarterly at rates that are indexed to the three-month LIBOR. Also included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed from FHLBs of $2 million in 2020, compared with $241 million and $577 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and subordinated capital notes of $1.4 billion in 2020 and
2019, compared with $1.5 billion in 2018. During December 2020, $409 million of subordinated capital notes of M&T Bank matured. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $527 million in 2020, $524 million in 2019 and $521 million in 2018. Also included in long-term borrowings were agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged $58 million in 2020, $245 million in 2019 and $415 million during 2018. The repurchase agreement held at December 31, 2019 totaled $102 million and matured in 2020. There were no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020. Additional information regarding long-term borrowings, including information regarding contractual maturities of such borrowings, is provided in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately $1.65 billion of outstanding fixed rate long-term borrowings. Additionally, interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $17.35 billion were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as discussed herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.00% in 2020, compared with 3.48% in 2019 and 3.55% in 2018. The yield on the Company’s earning assets decreased 110 basis points to 3.43% in 2020 from 4.53% in 2019 and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 62 basis points to .43% in 2020 from 1.05% in 2019. The narrowing of the net interest spread in 2020 compared with 2019 reflects the impact of the decreases in short-term interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve during the second half of 2019 and in March 2020. During 2018, the yield on earning assets was 4.33% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was .78%. The higher rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities in 2019 as compared with 2018 predominantly reflect the effect of increases in short-term interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve during 2018, partially offset in 2019 by decreases in such rates initiated during 2019. The increase in rates paid in 2019 on interest-bearing liabilities also reflects higher rates paid on mortgage escrow deposits associated with growth in the Company’s residential mortgage servicing activities. The rates paid on those deposits are often indexed to the federal funds rate or LIBOR, and are higher than the rates paid on most other savings and interest-checking deposit accounts.
Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest-free funds averaged $47.3 billion in 2020, $37.2 billion in 2019 and $39.1 billion in 2018. The increase in net interest-free funds in 2020 compared with 2019 reflects higher average balances of noninterest-bearing deposits. The decrease in average net interest-free funds in 2019 as compared with 2018 reflects declines in balances of noninterest-bearing deposits. Those deposits averaged $41.7 billion in 2020, $30.8 billion in 2019 and $31.9 billion in 2018. The increase in such balances from 2019 to 2020 was largely due to higher levels of deposits of commercial customers. Shareholders’ equity averaged $16.0 billion, $15.7 billion and $15.6 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $4.6 billion in each of 2020 and 2019 and $4.7 billion in 2018. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.8 billion in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in “other revenues from operations.” The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .16% in 2020, .36% in 2019 and .28% in 2018. The reduced contribution of
net interest-free funds to net interest margin in 2020 reflects the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value net interest-free funds.
Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interest-free funds as described herein, the Company’s net interest margin was 3.16% in 2020, 3.84% in 2019 and 3.83% in 2018. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Company’s net interest income and net interest margin.
Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $19.0 billion (excluding $32.1 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2020, $17.2 billion (excluding $40.4 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2019 and $7.3 billion (excluding $12.6 billion of forward-starting swap agreements) at December 31, 2018. Under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements, the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. At December 31, 2020, interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $17.35 billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans, compared with $13.35 billion at December 31, 2019 and $2.85 billion at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, interest swap agreements with notional amounts of $1.65 billion, $3.80 billion and $4.45 billion, respectively, were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate long-term borrowings. The Company has entered into the forward-starting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges, and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans.
In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted for similar to that associated with fair value hedges. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations. Information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information regarding the effective portion of cash flow hedges is presented in note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 10.

Computed as a percentage of average earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities.
(b)

(c)

In addition to interest rate swap agreements, the Company had entered into interest rate floor agreements that were accounted for in the trading account rather than as hedging instruments but, nevertheless, provided the Company with protection against the possibility of future declines in interest rates on its earning assets. Outstanding notional amounts of such agreements totaled $15.6 billion at each of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The agreements outstanding at the 2019 year-end matured in January and February 2020. The fair value of the interest rate floor agreements was not material at either December 31, 2019 or 2018.
Provision for Credit Losses
As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. That guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The new guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a $132 million increase in the allowance for credit losses at January 1, 2020. Increases in the allowance for residential real estate loans and consumer loans, reflecting the longer-dated maturities of such portfolios, were offset somewhat by net decreases in the allowance for commercial loans resulting from lower loss estimates on demand loan products due to the assumption that the Company could require full repayment of such loans in the near-term. Table 11 depicts the changes in the allowance for credit losses by loan category resulting from the adoption of the amended guidance.
Table 11
IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF AMENDED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The amended guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to be reflected in the allowance for credit losses. Previously, such losses were netted in the carrying value of the loans unless there was an increased loss expectation subsequent to their acquisition. The gross-up of the estimated losses on loans acquired at a discount that was previously not recognized in the allowance for credit losses was $18 million on January 1, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company generally recognized interest income on loans acquired at a discount regardless of the borrowers’ repayment status. Effective with the adoption of the new accounting guidance, the Company’s nonaccrual loan policy now applies to loans acquired at a discount. Loans acquired at a discount at December 31, 2019 included $171 million of loans that, effective with the adoption of the new guidance, were classified as non-accrual loans on January 1, 2020.
A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $800 million in 2020, compared with $176 million in 2019 and $132 million in 2018. As noted earlier, the significant increase in the provision in 2020 as compared with 2019 and 2018 follows the adoption of new accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 and reflects economic assumptions and projections that considered the macroeconomic outlook associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s estimates of expected losses reflect the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity, generally, and concerns about commercial real estate values and the ultimate collectability of commercial real estate loans where borrowers are requesting repayment forbearance. Net charge-offs of loans were $247 million in 2020, $144 million in 2019 and $130 million in 2018. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding were .26% in 2020, compared with .16% in 2019 and .15% in 2018. A summary of the Company’s loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 12 and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.

LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Nonaccrual loans aggregated $1.89 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $963 million and $894 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding, nonaccrual loans represented 1.92% at December 31, 2020, compared with 1.06% and 1.01% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The higher level of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019 reflects the addition of $530 million of loans associated with hotels in 2020 as well as other additions that, in general, resulted from the economic conditions in 2020.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $859 million or .87% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2020. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (excluding loans acquired at a discount) were $519 million or .57% at December 31, 2019 and $223 million or .25% at December 31, 2018. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $798 million, $480 million and $192 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual
mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans that are guaranteed by government-related entities totaled $764 million at December 31, 2020, $452 million at December 31, 2019 and $165 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in such loans at the end of 2020 as compared with the prior dates resulted from higher levels of loans repurchased during 2020. The remaining accruing loans past due 90 days or more not guaranteed by government-related entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal. In addition to the past due loans, the Company has also repurchased $1.6 billion of government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans during 2020 that are not considered delinquent because the borrower has requested and received a COVID-19 related payment deferral. Those loans were also repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs as described above and also remain covered by the insurance or guarantee of the applicable government-related entity. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due, renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 13.

NONPERFORMING ASSET AND PAST DUE, RENEGOTIATED AND IMPAIRED LOAN DATA
(a)
Predominantly residential real estate loans. Prior to 2020, excludes loans acquired at a discount
(b)
Prior to 2020, loans acquired at a discount that were recorded at fair value at acquisition date. This category does not include purchased impaired loans that are presented separately.
(c)
Prior to 2020, accruing loans acquired at a discount that were impaired at acquisition date and recorded at fair value.
Loans that were 30-89 days past due were $662 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and $866 million at December 31, 2018. The lower level of such past due loans at the end of 2020 reflects the impact of loan paydowns, many of which resulted in return to current status, and migrations of loans to nonaccrual status. COVID-19 related payment deferral modifications resulted in such loans being classified as current in accordance with regulatory guidance and, as a result, did not contribute in incremental additions to loans categorized as 30-89 days past due. Information about delinquent loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard on January 1, 2020, the Company reported purchased impaired loans. Those loans were impaired at the date of acquisition, were recorded at estimated fair value and were generally delinquent in payments, but, in accordance with GAAP, the Company continued to accrue interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows associated with the loans. The amended accounting guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to now be reflected in the allowance for credit losses and effective with the adoption of the guidance, the Company’s nonaccrual loan policy now applies to such loans. The carrying amount of purchased impaired loans was $228 million at December 31, 2019.
The United States has been operating under a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 13, 2020. The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction in economic activity that severely hampered the ability of some businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations. The CARES Act, in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers, created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans, protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency, and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. The banking regulatory agencies likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are, or may be, unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. That guidance, with concurrence of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and provisions of the CARES Act, allows modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief, to not be treated as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings. Modifications may include payment deferrals (including extensions of maturity dates), covenant waivers and fee waivers. The Company has worked with its customers affected by COVID-19 and, as previously noted, has granted modifications across many of its loan portfolios. To the extent that such modifications met the criteria previously described, such modifications have not been classified as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings.
The Company also modified the terms of select loans in an effort to assist borrowers that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and a concession was granted, the Company considered such modifications as troubled debt restructurings. Loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. Information about modifications of loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Residential real estate loans modified under specified loss mitigation programs prescribed by government guarantors that were not related to the COVID-19 pandemic have not been included in renegotiated loans because the loan guarantee remains in full force and, accordingly, the Company has not granted a concession with respect to the ultimate collection of the original loan balance. Such
loans totaled $342 million and $203 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Charge-offs of commercial loans and leases, net of recoveries, aggregated $119 million in 2020, $34 million in 2019 and $33 million in 2018. The higher level of such charge-offs in 2020 was largely experienced in the fourth quarter and related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrower’s ability to repay loans associated with malls and transportation services. Commercial loans and leases in nonaccrual status were $307 million at December 31, 2020, $347 million at December 31, 2019 and $234 million at December 31, 2018.
Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans totaled $31 million during 2020, compared with $9 million during 2019 and net recoveries of previously charged-off commercial real estate loans of $9 million in 2018. Reflected in the 2018 amount was a $13 million recovery associated with a hotel property. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonaccrual were $891 million at December 31, 2020, $195 million at December 31, 2019 and $231 million at December 31, 2018. Nonaccrual commercial real estate loans included construction-related loans of $115 million, $37 million and $27 million at the end of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status at the 2020 year-end as compared with December 31, 2019 was largely due to the addition of $530 million of hotel loans in 2020.
Net charge-offs of residential real estate loans totaled $3 million in 2020, $5 million in 2019 and $9 million in 2018. Residential real estate loans in nonaccrual status at December 31, 2020 were $513 million, compared with $319 million and $318 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase at the most recent year-end as compared with the prior year dates reflects the impact of the adoption of the amended accounting guidance as noted earlier and the effect of recent economic conditions on borrowers. Nonaccrual limited documentation first mortgage loans aggregated $147 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $83 million and $85 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Limited documentation first mortgage loans represent loans secured by residential real estate that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional loans. The Company no longer originates limited documentation loans. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest (excluding loans acquired at a discount prior to 2020) totaled $793 million at December 31, 2020, $487 million at December 31, 2019 and $190 million at December 31, 2018. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government-related entities, including the previously noted higher level of repurchases of loans associated with the Company’s loan servicing portfolio. However, loans that have been granted forbearances related to COVID-19 are not considered to be past due in accordance with the previously noted regulatory guidance and provisions of the CARES Act. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented in table 14.

Includes Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
Net charge-offs of consumer loans aggregated $93 million in 2020, compared with $97 million in each of 2019 and 2018. Included in net charge-offs of consumer loans were: automobile loans of $22 million in 2020, $24 million in 2019 and $33 million in 2018; recreational finance loans of $27 million, $26 million and $17 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively; and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of $3 million in 2020, $6 million in 2019 and $7 million in 2018. Nonaccrual consumer loans were $183 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $102 million and $110 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in nonaccrual consumer loans at the 2020, 2019 and 2018 year-ends were: automobile loans of $39 million, $21 million and $23 million, respectively; recreational finance loans of $26 million, $14 million and $11 million, respectively; and outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit of $79 million, $63 million and $71 million, respectively. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and lines of credit as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented in table 14. Information about past due and nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is also included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled $35 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $86 million at December 31, 2019 and $78 million at December 31, 2018. The decline in 2020 is largely reflective of foreclosure moratoriums imposed by government authorities in numerous jurisdictions. Net gains or losses associated with real estate and other foreclosed assets were not material in 2020, 2019 or 2018. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s holding of residential real estate-related properties comprised approximately 80% of foreclosed assets.
Beginning in 2020, management determines the allowance for credit losses under new accounting guidance that requires estimating the amount of current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio. Prior to 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in management’s judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A description of the methodologies used by the Company to estimate its allowance for credit losses in 2020 can be found in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.
In establishing the allowance for credit losses subsequent to December 31, 2019, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by type. At the time of the Company’s analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020, there existed substantial concerns about the national and regional economic decline related to the COVID-19 pandemic; the ultimate effectiveness of economic stimulus being provided by the U.S. government; the volatile nature of global markets, including the impact international economic conditions could have on the U.S. economy; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; the extent to which additional repayment forbearance might be requested by borrowers, in particular commercial real estate borrowers; and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions (approximately 49% of the Company’s loans and leases are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania) that could see lingering effects of the economic downturn. The Company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. Loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible “pass” loan grades and through the loss estimation modeling and other techniques used by the Company are generally considered to possess lower expected losses when determining the allowance for credit losses. Loans with an elevated level of credit risk are classified as “criticized” and are ascribed higher expected loss amounts when determining the allowance for credit losses. A criticized loan may be classified as “nonaccrual” if the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent
90 days or more. During 2020, the Company re-graded a significant portion of its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, particularly those that were modified as a result of COVID-19 impacts. Criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2018. The rise in criticized loans compared with the two prior year-ends reflects the impact of the pandemic on borrowers’ financial condition and the re-grading of loans by the Company.
The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses led to a significant reduction in economic activity that has been detrimental to many borrowers across the Company’s geographic regions. Borrowers have been and will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Summaries of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020 for which borrowers have been granted a COVID-19 related forbearance and loans extended under the PPP are provided in table 15. Of the COVID-19 related modifications with payment deferrals at December 31, 2020, substantially all are scheduled to expire during the first half of 2021.
As commercial loans and commercial real estate loans were approved for modifications related to COVID-19, loan officers and credit department personnel reviewed and reassigned loan grades, as deemed appropriate. The Company assessed loans considering the credit worthiness of the borrower, collateral values, the financial condition of any guarantors, and the expected collectability of contractual principal and interest payments. Loan-to-collateral values on investor-owned loans are generally relatively low and oftentimes the loans include some form of recourse. Loans secured by residential real estate with a COVID-19 payment forbearance were evaluated for collectability based on the borrower’s ability to repay considering past performance and estimated collateral values. If collectability was considered doubtful, loans were classified as nonaccrual.
Loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the Company’s credit department personnel continuously review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions. The Company re-assessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and expects that loans will continue to be re-graded in subsequent periods as more information becomes available. At least annually, however, updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis is performed. On a quarterly basis, the Company’s centralized credit department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than $1 million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade, including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing. For criticized nonaccrual loans, additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships. In analyzing criticized loans, borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrower’s outlook, and other pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the Company’s potential courses of action are contemplated.

With regard to residential real estate loans, the Company’s loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the Company’s residential real estate loans is located. For residential real estate-related loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual. Loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the Company is notified of such filings. At December 31, 2020, approximately 60% of the Company’s home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit. Of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio, approximately 60% (or approximately 24% of the aggregate home equity portfolio) consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the Company. To the extent known by the Company, if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency, even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the Company, the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the Company is placed on nonaccrual status. In monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent charge-off experience. When evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property. Home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years. At December 31, 2020, approximately 84% of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period, the weighted-average remaining draw periods were approximately five years, and approximately 6% were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal.
Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.
The Company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. To estimate expected losses, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company’s approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 included utilizing macro-economic assumptions to project losses over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company reverted to longer-term historical loss experience, over a period of one year, to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life. Forward-looking estimates of certain macro-economic variables are determined by the M&T Scenario Development Group, which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists. Changes in the forecasted economic assumptions from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 primarily reflect the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The assumptions utilized as of December 31, 2020 included the national unemployment rate continuing at elevated levels, on average 6.9% through 2021, followed
by a gradual return to long-term historical averages by the end of 2022. The forecast also assumed gross domestic product to grow at a 4.1% annual rate during 2021 resulting in a return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. Commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by 6.8% in 2021, followed by improvement. Residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly. The forecast considered approved government stimulus at the end of 2020, but not any further fiscal or monetary actions. The assumptions utilized as of January 1, 2020 at the time of adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe. Those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under 4% and steady growth in gross domestic product of 3.3% over the eight-quarter forecast period. Forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant. The assumptions utilized were based on information available to the Company at or near December 31, and January 1, 2020 at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates.
In establishing the allowance for credit losses the Company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations, changes in underwriting practices, product expansions into new markets, imprecision in its economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process. Geopolitical conditions assessed at the end of 2020 included the potential impact of COVID-19 on economic activity that could influence the ability of customers to repay loan amounts in accordance with their contractual obligations. With respect to economic forecasts, the Company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the two-year reasonable and supportable time period and of more negative or positive outcomes on its allowance for credit losses. Economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of COVID-19. Generally, an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product, commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses.
Prior to 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in management’s judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance was determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the current economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. The estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to 2020 did not consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that could have affected the collectability of the reported amounts.
A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 16. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodologies described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect the impact of the new accounting rules effective January 1, 2020 as well as changes in management’s estimate of credit losses in light of economic developments, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Furthermore, the Company’s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Table 16
ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES
Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.74 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $1.18 billion at January 1, 2020 when the new pronouncement became effective. The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.05 billion at December 31, 2019 and $1.02 billion at December 31, 2018. The increases in the allowance in 2020 as compared with the 2019 and 2018 year-ends reflected the $132 million addition attributable the adoption of the new accounting standard as well as the expected impact of forecasted economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers’ abilities to repay loans. As a percentage of loans outstanding, the allowance was 1.76% at December 31, 2020, 1.16% at December 31, 2019 and 1.15% at December 31, 2018. Excluding the impact of $5.4 billion of government-guaranteed PPP loans originated by the Company in the second quarter of 2020, the allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2020 was 1.86%. The level of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein. Should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should management’s assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The reported level of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date.
The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2020, however residential real estate loans comprised approximately 17% of the loan portfolio. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers aggregated $170 million at December 31, 2020, or .2% of total loans and leases.
Other Income
Other income aggregated $2.09 billion in 2020, up from $2.06 billion and $1.86 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The growth experienced from 2019 to 2020 reflected higher mortgage banking revenues and trust income, partially offset by declines in service charges on deposit accounts, trading account and foreign exchange gains and letter of credit and other credit-related fees. The 11% rise in other income from 2018 to 2019 was largely attributable to higher mortgage banking revenues, trust income, trading account and foreign exchange gains and valuation gains on investment securities.
Mortgage banking revenues aggregated $567 million in 2020, $458 million in 2019 and $360 million in 2018. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Company’s involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multifamily loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments, residential real estate loan servicing fees, and other residential real estate loan-related fees and income, were $424 million in 2020, up significantly from $317 million in 2019 and $239 million in 2018. The higher residential mortgage banking revenues in 2020 as compared with the two prior years resulted from higher gains associated with loans held for sale, reflecting higher origination volumes and improved margins.
New commitments to originate residential real estate loans to be sold rose to approximately $4.5 billion in 2020 from $2.7 billion in 2019 and $2.2 billion in 2018. Realized gains from sales of residential real estate loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans aggregated to gains of $191 million in 2020, $72 million in 2019 and $44 million in 2018.
Loans held for sale that were secured by residential real estate totaled $777 million and $414 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Commitments to sell residential real estate loans and commitments to originate residential real estate loans for sale at pre-determined rates totaled $1.47 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020, $713 million and $423 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and $364 million and $245 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Net recognized unrealized gains on residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans and commitments to originate loans for sale were $52 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $12 million at December 31, 2019 and $7 million at December 31, 2018. Changes in such net unrealized gains are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net increases in revenue of $40 million and $5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared with a net decrease in revenue of $3 million in 2018.
Revenues from servicing residential real estate loans for others totaled $233 million in 2020, compared with $245 million in 2019 and $195 million in 2018. Residential real estate loans serviced for others aggregated $94.4 billion at December 31, 2020, $95.1 billion a year earlier and $79.1 billion at December 31, 2018. On January 31, 2019, the Company purchased servicing rights for residential real estate loans that had outstanding principal balances at that date of approximately $13.3 billion. The purchase price of such servicing rights was approximately $144 million. Reflected in residential real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $68.1 billion, $62.8 billion and $56.8 billion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenues earned for sub-servicing such loans totaled $129 million in 2020, compared with $125 million in 2019 and $114 million in 2018. The Company added approximately $21.1 billion to its residential real estate loan sub-servicing portfolio during 2020. In 2019 and 2018, the Company added $17.6 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, of residential real estate loans sub-serviced for others. The contractual servicing rights associated with loans sub-serviced by the Company were predominantly held by affiliates of BLG. Information about the Company’s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $201 million at December 31, 2020 (net of a $30 million valuation allowance), compared with $237 million (net of a $7 million valuation allowance) and $121 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Provisions for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $23 million and $7 million were recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of
capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflected the impact of lower interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage loan prepayments. Additional information about the Company’s capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented in note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $143 million in 2020, compared with $141 million in 2019 and $121 million in 2018. Included in such amounts were revenues from loan origination and sales activities of $84 million in 2020, $81 million in 2019 and $64 million in 2018. The higher revenues in 2020 and 2019 as compared with 2018 were due to higher origination volumes and wider margins on loans originated for sale. Commercial real estate loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $3.4 billion in 2020, compared with $4.0 billion in 2019 and $2.4 billion in 2018. Loan servicing revenues totaled $59 million in 2020, $60 million in 2019 and $57 million in 2018. Capitalized commercial mortgage servicing assets were $133 million at December 31, 2020, $131 million at December 31, 2019 and $115 million at December 31, 2018. Commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors totaled $22.2 billion at December 31, 2020, $21.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and $18.2 billion at December 31, 2018, and included $4.0 billion at December 31, 2020, $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2018 of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectable. Included in commercial real estate loans serviced for others were loans sub-serviced for others of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Commitments to sell commercial real estate loans and commitments to originate commercial real estate loans for sale aggregated $641 million and $364 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020, $193 million and $164 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and $577 million and $229 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Commercial real estate loans held for sale were $278 million, $28 million and $347 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The higher balances at December 31, 2020 and 2018 reflect loans originated later in each year that had not been delivered to investors by year end.
Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $371 million in 2020, compared with $433 million in 2019 and $429 million in 2018. The decline in such service charges in 2020 as compared with 2019 and 2018 reflects lower consumer service charges, predominantly resulting from COVID-19 related fee waivers and lower customer transaction activity, and decreased commercial service charges, largely due to higher customer deposit levels that can be used by those customers to offset transaction-related fees.
Trust income includes fees related to two significant businesses. The Institutional Client Services (“ICS”) business provides a variety of trustee, agency, investment management and administrative services for corporations and institutions, investment bankers, corporate tax, finance and legal executives, and other institutional clients who: (i) use capital markets financing structures; (ii) use independent trustees to hold retirement plan and other assets; and (iii) need investment and cash management services. The Wealth Advisory Services (“WAS”) business offers personal trust, planning, fiduciary, asset management, family office and other services designed to help high net worth individuals and families grow, preserve and transfer wealth. Trust income was $602 million in 2020, compared with $573 million in 2019 and $538 million in 2018. Revenues associated with the ICS business were $342 million in 2020, $311 million in 2019 and $275 million in 2018. The increases in ICS revenue in 2020 and 2019 reflect sales activities and increased retirement services income resulting from growth in collective fund balances. Revenues attributable to WAS totaled $233 million in each of 2020 and 2019 and $237 million in 2018. As compared with 2019, revenue in 2020 reflected an increase related to equity market performance that was offset by proprietary fund money market fee waivers as a result of the current interest rate environment. The decline in such revenues in 2019 from 2018 reflects, in part, lower recurring fees due to product mix, competitive factors and lower sales. Trust assets under management were $135.8 billion and $113.0 billion at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Trust assets under management include the Company’s proprietary mutual funds’ assets of $12.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Additional trust income from investment management activities was $27 million, $29 million and $26 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and includes fees earned from retail customer investment accounts and in 2019 and 2018 also includes fees from an affiliated asset manager. The Company’s trust income associated with the affiliated asset manager that was sold in September 2019 was not material during 2019 or 2018.
Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $47 million in 2020, compared with $49 million in 2019 and $51 million in 2018. The decline in brokerage services income in each of the last two years resulted largely from lower income from sales of annuities. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $41 million in 2020, $62 million in 2019 and $33 million in 2018. Increased activity related to interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of commercial customers was the largest factor resulting in the higher gains in 2019 as compared with 2020 and 2018. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading “Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity.”
The Company recognized net losses on investment securities of $9 million in 2020 and $6 million in 2018, compared with net gains of $18 million in 2019. The gains and losses represented unrealized gains and losses on investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock.
Other revenues from operations totaled $471 million in 2020, compared with $469 million in 2019 and $451 million in 2018. Higher income received from BLG during 2020 was offset by declines in letter of credit and credit-related fees, predominantly loan syndication fees. The increase from 2018 to 2019 largely reflects higher income from BLG.
Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees totaled $109 million, $124 million and $125 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decreased level of such fees in 2020 resulted from lower loan syndication fees. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $111 million in 2020 and $117 million in each of 2019 and 2018. The lower level of such revenues in 2020 was the result of lower customer transaction activity reflecting the impact of the pandemic. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received, aggregated $48 million in each of 2020 and 2018, compared with $50 million in 2019. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $47 million in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. Automated teller machine usage fees aggregated $9 million in 2020, $13 million in 2019 and $14 million in 2018. The lower revenues in 2020 reflect waived fees resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
M&T’s investment in BLG resulted in income of $53 million in 2020, $37 million in 2019 and $24 million in 2018. The higher amount in 2020 reflects distributions from BLG of $23 million in the first quarter and $30 million in December 2020. In 2019 and 2018, BLG made distributions in the first quarter of those years. The Company believes that the distribution declared and paid by BLG in December 2020 likely occurred in lieu of a 2021 first quarter distribution. During 2017, the operating losses of BLG resulted in M&T reducing the carrying value of its investment in BLG to zero. Subsequently, M&T has received cash distributions from BLG that resulted in the recognition of income by M&T. M&T expects cash distributions from BLG in the future, but the timing and amount of those distributions cannot be estimated. BLG is entitled to receive distributions from affiliates that provide asset management and other services that are available for distribution to BLG’s owners,
including M&T. Information about the Company’s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Other Expense
Other expense aggregated $3.39 billion in 2020, compared to $3.47 billion in 2019 and $3.29 billion in 2018. Included in those amounts are expenses considered to be “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $15 million, $19 million and $25 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $3.37 billion in 2020, $3.45 billion in 2019 and $3.26 billion in 2018. Contributing to the lower level of noninterest operating expenses in 2020 as compared with the prior year were decreased costs for professional and outside services, legal-related matters, advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment. Additionally, a $48 million charge was recorded in 2019 to reduce the carrying value of an investment in an asset manager that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting to its estimated realizable value. Those factors were partially offset by higher costs for salaries and employee benefits, outside data processing and software, increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and $14 million of expenses related to the planned transition of the support for the Company’s retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of LPL Financial. The rise in noninterest operating expenses in 2019 as compared with 2018 was largely attributable to increased costs for salaries and employee benefits, outside data processing and software, equipment and net occupancy, and the $48 million charge associated with the sale of an equity investment in an asset manager. Partially offsetting those factors were lower costs associated with increases to the reserve for Wilmington Trust-related legal matters ($56 million in 2019 and $135 million in 2018), lower contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation of $29 million and a decline in FDIC assessments of $27 million.
Salaries and employee benefits expense aggregated $1.95 billion in 2020, compared with $1.90 billion and $1.75 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The higher levels of expenses in 2020 as compared with 2019 reflect the impact of merit and other increases for employees and higher employee benefits expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The increase in salaries and employee benefits from 2018 to 2019 reflects increased staffing levels, the impact of merit and other increases for employees and higher incentive and stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation totaled $80 million in 2020, compared with $76 million in 2019 and $66 million in 2018. The number of full-time equivalent employees were 17,076 and 17,503 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared with 16,938 at December 31, 2018.
The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits for its employees, including pension, retirement savings and post-retirement benefit plans. Expenses related to such benefits totaled $118 million in 2020, $76 million in 2019 and $85 million in 2018. The amounts recorded in salaries and employee benefits expense and other costs of operations, respectively, from the preceding sentence were as follows: $118 million and ($329,000) in 2020; $98 million and ($22) million in 2019; and $92 million and ($7) million in 2018. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was $60 million in 2020, $31 million in 2019 and $45 million in 2018. Information about the Company’s pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The Company’s retirement savings plan (“RSP”) is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. RSP expense reflecting the Company’s employer matching contribution totaled $62 million in 2020, $48 million in 2019 and $43 million in 2018.
Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses were $1.42 billion in 2020, $1.55 billion in 2019 and $1.51 billion in 2018. The decrease in such
expenses in 2020 as compared with 2019 reflects declines in expenditures for professional and outside services, legal-related matters, advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment. Additionally, the $48 million charge from the 2019 sale of an investment in an asset manager contributed to the higher expenses in 2019. Those factors were partially offset by higher costs for outside data processing and software, increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and $14 million of expenses related to the planned transition of the support for the Company’s retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of LPL Financial. The rise in nonpersonnel operating expenses in 2019 as compared with 2018 was predominantly the result of higher expenses for outside data processing and software, equipment and net occupancy, professional services, and the $48 million charge in 2019 associated with the sale of an equity investment in an asset manager. Those factors were partially offset by lower costs associated with legal-related matters and contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation, and a decline in FDIC assessments. As noted previously, during 2019 the Company increased its reserve for legal matters, predominantly related to a subsidiary’s role as trustee of Employee Stock Ownership Plans in its Institutional Client Services business. In addition, during 2018 WT Corp. reached an agreement related to alleged conduct of that subsidiary prior to its acquisition by M&T that led to the Company adding $135 million to its reserve for legal matters 2018. The Company made contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation of $8 million and $29 million in 2020 and 2018, respectively. There were no similar contributions in 2019.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $416 million in 2020, $618 million in 2019 and $590 million in 2018. The effective tax rates were 23.5% in each of 2020 and 2018 and 24.3% in 2019. The effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large discrete or infrequently occurring items. The Company’s effective tax rate in future periods will also be affected by any change in income tax laws or regulations and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company’s interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.
International Activities
Assets and revenues associated with international activities represent less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. International assets included $170 million and $186 million of loans to foreign borrowers at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Deposits in the Company’s office in the Cayman Islands aggregated $652 million at December 31, 2020 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand, which decreased in 2020 largely due to customers’ reactions to the decline in interest rates. Loans at M&T Bank’s commercial banking office in Ontario, Canada included in international assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $149 million and $143 million, respectively. Deposits at that office were $32 million at December 31, 2020 and $23 million at December 31, 2019. The Company also offers trust-related services in Europe. Revenues from providing such services during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $36 million, $32 million and $29 million, respectively.
Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity
As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.
The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the Company’s businesses. Nevertheless, the Company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 88% of the Company’s earning assets at December 31, 2020, compared with 83% at December 31, 2019 and 78% at December 31, 2018.
The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including overnight federal funds purchased, short-term advances from the FHLB of New York, brokered deposits, Cayman Islands office deposits and longer-term borrowings. At December 31, 2020, M&T Bank had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $19.0 billion. Outstanding borrowings under FHLB credit facilities totaled $2 million at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Such borrowings were secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank had an available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that totaled approximately $13.0 billion at December 31, 2020. The amount of that line is dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under such line of credit at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Senior notes issued and outstanding totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2019. The decline at December 31, 2020 as compared with the 2019 year-end reflects redemptions of borrowings during 2020. On January 7, 2020 M&T Bank redeemed $750 million of senior notes that were due to mature in February 2020. In addition, M&T Bank redeemed $750 million of senior notes on July 17, 2020 that were due to mature on August 17, 2020. Finally, M&T Bank redeemed $650 million of senior notes on December 28, 2020 that were due to mature on January 21, 2021.
The Company has, from time to time, issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company’s junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities have been phased-out of the definition of Tier 1 capital but, similar to other subordinated capital notes, are considered Tier 2 capital and are includable in total regulatory capital. Information about the Company’s borrowings is included in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.
In addition to satisfying customer demand, Cayman Islands office deposits may be used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Cayman Islands office deposits totaled $652 million and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits. The Company has brokered savings and interest-bearing checking deposit accounts that aggregated $4.5 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates.
The Company’s ability to obtain funding from these other sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available
capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 17. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.
Table 17
DEBT RATINGS
Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (“VRDBs”). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading account assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Company’s trading account was not material at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. The total amount of VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit was $725 million and $857 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

The data do not include nonaccrual loans.
The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2020 are summarized in table 19. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 19 summarizes the Company’s other commitments as of December 31, 2020 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.
Table 19
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
(a)
Amounts exclude discretionary funding commitments to commercial customers of $10.4 billion that the Company has the unconditional right to cancel prior to funding.
M&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any bank subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of that test, at December 31, 2020 approximately $1.3 billion was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries. M&T also may obtain funding through long-term borrowings. Outstanding senior notes of M&T at December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019 were $783 million and $770 million, respectively. Junior subordinated debentures of M&T associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 totaled $528 million and $525 million, respectively.

Management closely monitors the Company’s liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.
Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company’s core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a “value of equity” model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was $19.0 billion. In addition, the Company has entered into $32.1 billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading “Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities” and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The Company’s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-
parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market-implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.
Table 22 displays as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.
Table 22
SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES
The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelve-month period as compared with the base scenario. In the declining rate scenario, the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. The sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates increased as of December 31, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019 due to the low interest rate environment and composition of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, in particular the increased balance of interest-bearing deposits at banks.
Table 23 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered
into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement.
Table 23
CONTRACTUAL REPRICING DATA
Changes in fair value of the Company’s financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the Company’s investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes 2 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The Company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the Company’s obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account. The fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note 18 of
Notes to Financial Statements. The amounts of gross and net trading account positions, as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&T’s Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Company’s trading account activities.
The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled $37.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $48.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes were $776 million and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the unsettled fair values of all financial instruments used for trading account activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $1.1 billion and $117 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and $470 million and $80 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The fair value asset and liability amounts at December 31, 2020 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $6 million and $806 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2019 by contractual settlements of $43 million and $281 million, respectively. The higher balance of trading account assets at December 31, 2020 as compared with 2019 was largely the result of increased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments. Included in trading account assets at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $21 million of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as “trading account and foreign exchange gains” in the consolidated statement of income. Included in “other liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $24 million and $25 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in “other costs of operations” in the consolidated statement of income. Also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the Company was required to hold under terms of certain non-qualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the Company in various acquisitions. Those assets totaled $29 million and $28 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Given the Company’s policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading account activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the Company’s trading account activities. Additional information about the Company’s use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Capital
Shareholders’ equity was $16.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and represented 11.35% of total assets, compared with $15.7 billion or 13.11% at December 31, 2019 and $15.5 billion or 12.87% at December 31, 2018.
Included in shareholders’ equity was preferred stock with financial statement carrying values of $1.25 billion at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and $1.23 billion at December 31, 2018. On July 30, 2019, M&T issued 40,000 shares of Series G Perpetual Fixed-Rate Reset Non-cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share and liquidation preference of $10,000 per share. Through July 31, 2024 holders of the Series G preferred stock are entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by M&T’s Board of Directors, non-cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.0%, payable semiannually in arrears. Subsequent to July 31, 2024 holders will be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by M&T’s Board of Directors, non-cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of the five-year U.S. Treasury Rate plus 3.174%, payable semiannually in arrears. The Series G
preferred stock may be redeemed at M&T’s option, in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date on or after August 1, 2024 or, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event whereby the full liquidation value of the shares no longer qualifies as “additional Tier 1 capital.” On August 30, 2019 M&T redeemed the 230,000 shares of the Series A and 151,500 shares of the Series C Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $1,000 liquidation preference per share, having received the approval of the Federal Reserve to redeem such shares after issuing the Series G preferred stock. Further information concerning M&T’s preferred stock can be found in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Common shareholders’ equity totaled $14.9 billion, or $116.39 per share, at December 31, 2020, compared with $14.5 billion, or $110.78 per share, at December 31, 2019 and $14.2 billion, or $102.69 per share, at December 31, 2018. Tangible equity per common share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $80.52 at December 31, 2020, compared with $75.44 and $69.28 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 7.49% at December 31, 2020, compared with 8.55% and 8.31% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reconciliations of total common shareholders’ equity and tangible common equity and total assets and tangible assets as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented in table 2. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the ratio of average total shareholders’ equity to average total assets was 11.80%, 13.14% and 13.36%, respectively. The ratio of average common shareholders’ equity to average total assets was 10.88%, 12.08% and 12.31% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Shareholders’ equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, remaining unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities transferred from available for sale that have not yet been amortized, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized gains on investment securities reflected in shareholders’ equity, net of applicable tax effect, were $145 million, or $1.13 per common share, at December 31, 2020 and $37 million, or $.29 per common share, at December 31, 2019, compared with net unrealized losses of $148 million, or $1.06 per common share, at December 31, 2018. Changes in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities are predominantly reflective of the impact of changes in interest rates on the values of such securities. Information about unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is included in note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Reflected in the carrying amount of available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2020 were pre-tax effect unrealized gains of $211 million on securities with an amortized cost of $4.5 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized losses of $9 million on securities with an amortized cost of $125 million. Information concerning the Company’s fair valuations of investment securities is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Each reporting period the Company reviews its available-for-sale investment securities for declines in value that might be indicative of credit-related losses through an analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuer or the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond. If the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a debt security a credit loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. A loss is also recognized if the Company intends to sell a bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell a bond before recovery of the amortized cost basis.
As of December 31, 2020, based on a review of each of the securities in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, the Company concluded that it expected to realize the amortized cost basis of each security. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any securities for which fair value was less than the
amortized cost basis of the security. The Company intends to continue to closely monitor the performance of its securities because changes in their underlying credit performance or other events could cause the amortized cost basis of those securities to become uncollectable.
On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted amended accounting guidance that requires investment securities held to maturity to be presented at their net carrying value that is expected to be collected over their contractual term. The Company estimated no material allowance for credit losses for its investment securities classified as held-to-maturity at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 as the substantial majority of such investment securities were obligations backed by the U.S. government or its agencies. The Company assessed the potential for expected credit losses on privately issued mortgage-backed securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio by performing internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash flows considering recent performance of the mortgage loan collateral and utilizing assumptions about future defaults and loss severity. These bond-specific cash flows also reflect the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining subordination levels. In total, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had in its held-to-maturity portfolio privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis of $77 million and $93 million, respectively, and a fair value of $70 million and $87 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, 82% of the mortgage-backed securities were in the most senior tranche of the securitization structure. The mortgage-backed securities are generally collateralized by residential and small-balance commercial real estate loans originated between 2004 and 2008. Given the securitization structure, some of the bonds held by the Company may defer interest payments in certain circumstances, but after considering the repayment structure and estimated future collateral cash flows of each individual bond, the Company has concluded that as of December 31, 2020, it expected to recover the amortized cost basis of those privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Nevertheless, it is possible that adverse changes in the estimated future performance of mortgage loan collateral underlying such securities could impact the Company’s conclusions.
Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $481 million, or $3.75 per common share, at December 31, 2020, $342 million, or $2.62 per common share, at December 31, 2019 and $261 million, or $1.89 per common share, at December 31, 2018. Information about the funded status of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Pursuant to previously approved capital plans and authorizations by M&T’s Board of Directors, M&T repurchased 2,577,000 common shares for $374 million in the first quarter of 2020. During 2019, M&T repurchased 8,257,000 common shares for $1.3 billion. In 2018, M&T repurchased 12,295,817 common shares for $2.2 billion. On January 20, 2021, M&T’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan to repurchase up to $800 million of shares of M&T’s common stock subject to all applicable regulatory limitations.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, M&T’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $1.10 per common share from the previous rate of $1.00 per common share. During 2018, M&T’s Board of Directors authorized increases in the quarterly common stock dividend to $.80 per common share in the second quarter from the previous rate of $.75 per common share and to $1.00 per common share in the third quarter. Cash dividends declared on M&T’s common stock totaled $569 million in 2020, compared with $552 million and $511 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Dividends per common share totaled $4.40 in 2020, compared with $4.10 and $3.55 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Dividends of $68 million in 2020, $72 million in 2019 and $73 million in 2018 were declared on preferred stock in accordance with the terms of each series.
M&T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. Pursuant to those regulations, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:
•
4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations);
•
6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations);
•
8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets (each as defined in the capital regulations); and
•
4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”), as defined in the capital regulations.
In addition, capital regulations require a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% composed entirely of CET1 on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued rules that allow banks and bank holding companies to phase-in the impact of adopting the expected credit loss accounting model on regulatory capital. Those rules allow banks and bank holding companies to delay for two years the day one impact on retained earnings of adopting the expected loss accounting standard and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses subsequent to the initial adoption, followed by a three-year transition period. M&T and its subsidiary banks adopted these rules and the impact is reflected in regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2020. The regulatory capital amounts and ratios of M&T and its bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 are presented in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements. A detailed discussion of the regulatory capital rules is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Capital Requirements.”
The Company is subject to the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, which includes examinations by a number of regulators. Regulation of financial institutions such as M&T and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and the banking and financial system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors. Changes in laws, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to the Company’s operations can increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive environment in which the Company operates, all of which could have a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and in M&T’s ability to pay dividends. For additional information concerning this comprehensive regulatory framework, refer to Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
Fourth Quarter Results
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $471 million, compared with $493 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were each $3.52 in the final 2020 quarter, compared with diluted and basic earnings per common share of $3.60 in the corresponding quarter of 2019. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common shareholders’ equity for the final quarter of 2020 were 1.30% and 12.07%, respectively, compared with 1.60% and 12.95%, respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2019.
Net operating income during 2020’s fourth quarter was $473 million, compared with $496 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.54 and $3.62 in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in the final three months of 2020 were 1.35% and 17.53%, respectively, compared with 1.67% and 19.08%, respectively, in the similar 2019
period. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2020 and 2019 are provided in table 25.
Taxable-equivalent net interest income aggregated $993 million in the final quarter of 2020, compared with $1.01 billion in the year-earlier period. That decline was predominantly attributable to a 64 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin to 3.00% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 3.64% in the final three months of 2019. Partially offsetting the impact of the lower net interest margin was a 19% rise in average earning assets, from $110.6 billion in 2019 to $131.9 billion in 2020. The $21.3 billion rise in average earning assets was driven by a $13.3 billion increase in low-yielding deposit balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other banks and an $8.4 billion increase in loans outstanding. The narrowing of the net interest margin reflects the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the Federal Reserve to decrease its target Federal funds rate three times in the second half of 2019 (each by a .25% increment) and twice in March of 2020 (first by .50%, then another by 1.0%). Average balances of commercial loans and leases were $27.7 billion in the recent quarter, up $4.2 billion or 18% from $23.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. That increase was due to PPP loans originated in 2020 that averaged $6.2 billion in the final 2020 quarter. Average commercial real estate loan balances aggregated $37.7 billion in the final quarter of 2020, up $2.7 billion or 8% from $35.0 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Included in those totals were average balances of loans held for sale of $307 million in the final three months of 2020, compared with $201 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Average residential real estate loan balances increased $431 million to $16.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $16.3 billion in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting repurchases of government-guaranteed loans from Ginnie Mae pools that are serviced by the Company that were partially offset by ongoing repayments of loans obtained in the acquisition of Hudson City. Also contributing to the increase were loans held for sale that averaged $645 million and $382 million in the final quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Consumer loans averaged $16.5 billion in the last three months of 2020, $1.2 billion or 8% higher than in the year-earlier quarter. That increase resulted from higher average balances of recreational finance loans of $1.6 billion and automobile loans of $145 million, offset, in part, by a $485 million decline in average balances of home equity loans and lines of credit. The net interest spread narrowed in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 2.90%, down 40 basis points from 3.30% in the corresponding quarter of 2019. The yield on earning assets in the last three months of 2020 was 3.15%, down 112 basis points from the year-earlier quarter. That decline reflects the impact of decreases in short-term interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2019 and in March 2020 that contributed to lower yields on loans and leases. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in the 2020’s final quarter was .25%, down 72 basis points from .97% in the similar quarter of 2019. That decrease reflects the low interest rate environment and its impact on rates paid on deposits, as well as repayments of long-term borrowings. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the Company’s net interest margin was .10% and .34% in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, the Company’s net interest margin narrowed to 3.00% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 3.64% in the year-earlier period.
The provision for credit losses was $75 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared with $54 million in the year-earlier period. Net loan charge-offs were $97 million in the last three months of 2020, representing an annualized .39% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $41 million or .18% during the similar 2019 period. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 included: net recoveries of residential real estate loans of $1 million in 2020 and net charge-offs of less than $1 million in 2019; net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans of $12 million in 2020, compared with $1 million in 2019; net charge-offs of commercial loans of $67 million in 2020 and $14 million in 2019; and net charge-offs of consumer loans of $19 million in 2020 and $27 million in 2019.
Other income rose to $551 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $521 million in the similar 2019 period. That improvement reflects a $30 million distribution from BLG and higher mortgage banking revenues, partially offset by declines in service charges on deposit accounts, loan syndication fees and trading account and foreign exchange gains. The rise in mortgage banking revenues predominantly reflects higher origination income from the residential and commercial mortgage banking businesses.
Other expense totaled $845 million during the recent quarter, compared with $824 million in the final quarter of 2019. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be “nonoperating” in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $3 million and $4 million during the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $842 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $819 million in the corresponding 2019 quarter. The higher level of expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 was largely attributable to increased costs for salaries and employee benefits, changes in the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and $14 million of expenses related to the planned transition of the support for the Company’s retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of LPL Financial, partially offset by lower costs for professional and outside services, advertising and marketing, and travel and entertainment. The last two categories reflect reduced business activities stemming from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s efficiency ratio during the final quarters of 2020 and 2019 was 54.6% and 53.1%, respectively. Table 25 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense and the calculation of the efficiency ratio for each of the quarters of 2020 and 2019.
Segment Information
In accordance with GAAP, the Company’s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.
The financial information of the Company’s segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Company’s segments is presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.
The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services to small businesses and professionals within markets served by the Company through the Company’s branch network, business banking centers and other delivery channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and automated teller machines. Services and products offered by this segment include various business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit products, and financial services such as cash management, payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credit. The Business Banking segment recorded net income of $159 million in 2020, compared with $168 million in 2019. That 6% decline resulted from a $10 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, a $9 million increase in the
provision for credit losses, due largely to higher net charge-offs, and higher personnel-related costs of $7 million. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by an $11 million increase in net interest income. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts reflected the impact of the pandemic that has resulted in reduced customer transaction activity and higher customer deposit levels that can be used to offset transaction-related fees. The growth in net interest income reflected an increase in average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $3.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 89 basis points and 17 basis points, respectively. The growth in average deposits reflects customers’ desire for liquidity given the low interest rate environment and the pandemic. The rise in average loan balances reflects PPP loans originated during 2020, which averaged $2.4 billion in 2020 in this segment. The Business Banking segment contributed net income of $168 million in 2018. Higher net interest income of $17 million in 2019 was largely offset by increases of $11 million in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Business Banking segment and $6 million in the provision for credit losses, primarily due to higher net charge-offs. The higher net interest income reflected a six basis point widening of the net interest margin on deposits, higher average deposit balances of $192 million and higher average outstanding loan balances of $151 million.
The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment contributed net income of $508 million in 2020, down from $520 million in 2019. The decline in net income from 2019 was predominantly driven by a $48 million increase in the provision for credit losses, due to higher loan balances and net charge-offs. Also contributing to the lower net income was a $9 million write-down of equipment in 2020 that was leased to customers. Offsetting the noted unfavorable factors were a $35 million increase in net interest income and an $11 million decrease in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Commercial Banking segment. The increased net interest income reflected higher average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $6.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, partially offset by an 84 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits. The increase in average deposits reflects customers’ desire for liquidity given the low interest rate environment and the pandemic. The rise in average loan balances reflects average PPP loans of $2.0 billion in this segment in 2020. Net income for the Commercial Banking segment totaled $539 million in 2018. The 3% decline in net income in 2019 as compared with 2018 resulted from an $18 million increase in centrally-allocated costs, largely associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Commercial Banking segment, a higher provision for credit losses of $17 million primarily due to lower recoveries of previously charged-off loans, and higher personnel-related costs of $6 million. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were lower FDIC assessments of $11 million and a $7 million rise in net interest income. The increase in net interest income reflected higher average outstanding loan balances of $1.4 billion and a five basis point widening of the net interest margin on deposits offset, in part, by a narrowing of the net interest margin on loans of seven basis points and lower average deposit balances of $612 million.
The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. Commercial real estate loans held for sale are included in this segment. Net income of the Commercial Real Estate segment aggregated $382 million in 2020, down 21% from $486 million in 2019. That decline resulted from a $106 million rise in the provision for credit losses, due to higher
loan balances and net charge-offs, a decrease in net interest income of $19 million, higher salaries and employee benefits expense of $11 million, largely reflecting increased incentive compensation costs, and lower trading account and foreign exchange gains of $9 million, resulting from decreased activity related to interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of commercial customers. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors was a $10 million rise in commercial mortgage banking revenues, due in part to wider margins on loans originated for sale. The lower net interest income was largely attributable to a narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits and loans of 76 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, partially offset by higher average outstanding loan balances of $1.7 billion. Net income for this segment was $453 million in 2018. The 7% increase in net income from 2018 to 2019 resulted from a $27 million increase in net interest income, reflecting higher average outstanding loan balances of $914 million, higher mortgage banking revenues of $15 million, due largely to increased origination activities, higher trading account and foreign exchange gains of $13 million, resulting from increased activity related to interest rate swap agreements executed on behalf of commercial customers, and reduced FDIC assessments of $13 million. Those favorable factors were partially offset by a $25 million increase in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Commercial Real Estate segment and an $11 million rise in personnel-related expenses, reflecting merit and other increases and higher incentive-based compensation.
The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading account securities, residential real estate loans and other assets, short-term and long-term borrowed funds, brokered deposits, and Cayman Islands office deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of $327 million in 2020 and $144 million in 2019. That significant increase was driven by a $277 million rise in net interest income, reflecting additional income from interest rate swap agreements utilized as part of the Company’s management of interest rate risk. Partially offsetting that factor were valuation losses associated with marketable equity securities (compared with gains in the 2019 period) representing a change of $25 million. Net income of the Discretionary Portfolio segment aggregated $116 million in 2018. The 24% rise in the 2019’s net income as compared with 2018 was predominantly due to $18 million of unrealized valuation gains associated with marketable equity securities (compared with unrealized losses of $6 million in 2018), higher trading account and foreign exchange gains of $7 million resulting from lower valuation losses on interest rate floor contracts and a $7 million decline in FDIC assessments, partially offset by lower net interest income of $18 million, reflecting lower average outstanding loan balances.
The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. The Company periodically purchases the rights to service loans and also sub-services residential real estate loans for others. Residential real estate loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment’s net income rose 85% to $134 million in 2020 from $72 million in 2019. That improvement resulted from a $131 million increase in revenues associated with mortgage origination and sales activities (including intersegment revenues) and higher net interest income of $33 million, reflecting increased average outstanding balances of deposits and loans of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Offsetting those favorable factors were higher servicing-related costs (including intersegment costs and increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights) of $37 million, higher personnel-related costs of $22 million, reflecting increased headcount and higher commissions, lower revenues of $17 million associated with servicing and sub-servicing residential real estate loans (including intersegment revenues), and a $14 million rise in centrally-allocated costs associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment’s net income in 2019 was up 59%
from the $45 million earned in 2018. That improvement was attributable to higher revenues of $47 million associated with servicing and sub-servicing residential real estate loans (including intersegment revenues), a $37 million rise in revenues from mortgage origination and sales activities (including intersegment revenues), and higher net interest income of $6 million, reflecting a widening of the net interest margin on deposits of 22 basis points and higher average deposit balances of $751 million, offset, in part, by a narrowing of the net interest margin on loans of 73 basis points. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a $24 million increase in servicing-related costs (including intersegment costs and increases to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights), higher outside data processing and software expenses of $14 million, and an $8 million rise in personnel-related costs.
The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers through several delivery channels which include branch offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York State, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, automobile and recreational finance loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and credit cards. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts, investment products, including mutual funds and annuities, and other services. Net income for the Retail Banking segment was $365 million in 2020, down 31% from $528 million in 2019. That decrease was predominantly attributable to a $185 million decline in net interest income, reflecting a 74 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits partially offset by higher average outstanding deposit and loan balances of $2.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, and a $51 million decrease in consumer service charges on deposit accounts. The lower consumer service charges reflect fee waivers and lower transaction activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those unfavorable factors were offset, in part, by a $17 million decrease in advertising and marketing expenses due to reduced business activities related to the pandemic and a $14 million decline in the provision for credit losses. Net income for the Retail Banking segment totaled $541 million in 2018. Factors contributing to the decline in net income from 2018 to 2019 included a $20 million rise in personnel-related costs due largely to merit and other increases, higher professional services and other operating expenses of $15 million, a $10 million rise in the provision for credit losses, due to higher net charge-offs and loan balances, and a $9 million increase in centrally-allocated costs, largely associated with data processing, risk management and other support services provided to the Retail Banking segment. Those factors were partially offset by increases of $39 million in net interest income and $8 million in service charges on deposit accounts. The net interest income growth reflected higher average outstanding loan balances of $1.2 billion and a widening of the net interest margin on deposits of 10 basis points, partially offset by lower average deposit balances of $1.2 billion.
The “All Other” category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions, distributions from BLG, merger-related expenses resulting from acquisitions (when incurred) and the net impact of the Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The “All Other” category also includes trust income of the Company that reflects the ICS and WAS business activities. The various components of the “All Other” category resulted in a net loss of $523 million in 2020, compared with net income of $11 million and $55 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net loss in 2020 as compared with 2019’s net income resulted from a $476 million increase in the provision for credit losses, the unfavorable impact from the Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s reportable segments, and a $29 million increase in outside data processing and software costs. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by a $112 million decrease in professional and outside services, a $49 million decrease in accruals for legal matters, a $48 million charge in 2019 from the sale of an affiliated asset manager, higher trust income of $29 million, and increased income from BLG during 2020 of $16 million. As compared with 2018, the lower net income in 2019 resulted from the $48 million charge from the sale of the affiliated asset manager and higher expenses for salaries and employee benefits, equipment and net occupancy, and professional services (net of allocations of centralized support services to other segments). Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by lower accruals for legal matters of $79 million ($56 million in 2019, compared with $135 million in 2018), higher trust income of $35 million, the favorable impact from the Company’s allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits
associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Company’s reportable segments, lower contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation of $29 million, and a $13 million increase in income from BLG.
Recent Accounting Developments

Forward-Looking Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company’s business, management’s beliefs and assumptions made by management. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement, including statements regarding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” “positions,” “prospects” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors”) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company assumes no duty to update forward-looking statements.
Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; risks and uncertainties relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues; legislation and/or regulation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively, including tax legislation or regulation; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, regulatory agencies or legislation; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes; protection and validity of intellectual
property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and its subsidiaries' future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition and investment activities compared with M&T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements.
These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors.
Further, statements about the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond the Company’s control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on customers, clients, third parties and the Company.
