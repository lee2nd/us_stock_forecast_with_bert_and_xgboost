MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are not historical facts and include expressions about Management’s confidence and strategies and Management’s expectations about new and existing programs and products, investments, relationships, opportunities and market conditions. These statements may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as “expect,” “look,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “may,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:
•
our inability to successfully grow our business and implement our strategic plan, including an inability to generate revenues to offset the increased personnel and other costs related to the strategic plan;
•
the impact of anticipated higher operating expenses in 2021 and beyond;
•
our inability to successfully integrate wealth management firm acquisitions;
•
our inability to manage our growth;
•
our inability to successfully integrate our expanded employee base;
•
an unexpected decline in the economy, in particular in our New Jersey and New York market areas;
•
declines in our net interest margin caused by the interest rate environment and/or our highly competitive market;
•
declines in value in our investment portfolio;
•
higher than expected increases in our allowance for loan and lease losses;
•
higher than expected increases in loan and lease losses or in the level of nonperforming loans;
•
changes in interest rates;
•
decline in real estate values within our market areas;
•
legislative and regulatory actions (including the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Basel III and related regulations) that may result in increased compliance costs;
•
successful cyberattacks against our IT infrastructure and that of our IT and third-party providers;
•
higher than expected FDIC insurance premiums;
•
adverse weather conditions;
•
our inability to successfully generate new business in new geographic markets;
•
our inability to execute upon new business initiatives;
•
our lack of liquidity to fund our various cash obligations;
•
reduction in our lower-cost funding sources;
•
our inability to adapt to technological changes;
•
claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility, environmental laws and other matters;
•
our inability to retain key employees;
•
demand for loans and deposits in our market areas;
•
adverse changes in securities markets;
•
changes in accounting policies and practices; and
•
other unexpected material adverse changes in our operations or earnings.
Further, given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and when and whether the gradual reopening of businesses will result in a meaningful increase in economic activity. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:
•
demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;
•
if the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;
•
collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;
•
our allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which will adversely affect our net income;
•
the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;
•
as the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board’s target federal funds rate to near 0%, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;
•
a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;
•
our wealth management revenues may decline with continuing market turmoil;
•
a worsening of business and economic conditions or in the financial markets could result in an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;
•
the unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak, which could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy, especially as we may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors;
•
we may face litigation, regulatory enforcement and reputation risk as a result of our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties;
•
our cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; and
•
FDIC premiums may increase if the agency experience additional resolution costs.
Except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the Company’s expectations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
OVERVIEW: The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide information about the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and supplemental financial information appearing elsewhere in this report.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded net income of $26.19 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.37 compared to $47.43 million and $2.44, respectively, for 2019, reflecting decreases of $21.24 million, or 45 percent, and $1.07 per share, or 44 percent, respectively. During 2020, the Company continued to focus on executing its Strategic Plan - known as “Expanding Our Reach” - which focuses on the client experience and organic growth across all lines of business. The Strategic Plan called for expansion of the Company’s wealth management business, organically and through acquisitions, and also expansion of the Company’s commercial and industrial (“C&I”) lending platform, through the use of private bankers, who lead with deposit gathering and wealth management discussions.
The following are select highlights for 2020:
•
At December 31, 2020, the market value of assets under management and/or administration at Peapack Private was $8.8 billion, reflecting an increase of 17 percent from $7.5 billion at December 31, 2019.
•
Fee income from Peapack Private totaled $40.9 million for 2020, growing from $38.4 million for 2019.
•
At December 31, 2020, total C&I loans (including equipment finance and PPP loans) comprised 45 percent of the total loan portfolio.
•
Total “customer” deposits (defined as deposits excluding brokered CDs and brokered “overnight” interest-bearing demand deposits) at December 31, 2020 were $4.67 billion, reflecting an increase of $644.9 million, or 16 percent, when compared to $4.03 billion at December 31, 2019.
•
Asset quality metrics continued to be strong at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020 were $11.46 million, or 0.19 percent of total assets. Total loans past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing were $5.1 million or 0.11 percent of total loans at December 31, 2020.
•
The Bank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2020 remain well above regulatory well capitalized standards.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.
Management believes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of complexity and requires Management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could materially impact the Company’s results of operations. These critical policies and their application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
The provision for loan losses is based upon Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance, including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio, giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, level of delinquencies, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, the existence and estimated fair value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans, and current economic and market conditions. Although Management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant judgment and change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to record additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, the majority of the Company’s loans are secured by real estate in the State of New Jersey and the New York City area. Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the Company’s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may experience adverse economic conditions. Future adjustments to the provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the Company’s control.
The Company accounts for its debt securities in accordance with “Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, “Investments - Debt Securities” and its equity security in accordance with ASC 321, “Investments - Equity Securities”. All securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, with the exception of the Company’s investment in a CRA investment fund which is classified as an equity security. In accordance with ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments” unrealized holding gains and losses are marked to market through the income statement.
EARNINGS SUMMARY:
The following table presents certain key aspects of our performance for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
2020 compared to 2019
The Company recorded net income of $26.19 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.37 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net income of $47.43 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.44 for the year ended December 31, 2019. These results produced a return on average assets of 0.45 percent and 0.99 percent for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a return on average shareholders’ equity of 5.11 percent and 9.70 percent for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The decrease in net income for 2020 was due to a $32.40 million provision for loan losses primarily due to the economic environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased qualitative loss factors when calculating the allowance for loan losses and increased operating expenses. This $32.40 million compared to a $4.00 million provision for 2019. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020 caused by the changes in the treatment of tax net operating losses (“NOL”) under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. Increased operating expenses were due to the
Point View Wealth Management acquisition in 2019, prepayment of FHLB advances ($4.78 million), valuation allowance for a loan held for sale ($4.43 million) and the consolidation of two private banking offices ($210,000). Higher operating expenses were also due to costs associated with the implementation of the Strategic Plan, described in the “Overview” section above.
NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN
The major source of the Company’s operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on interest-earning assets and fees earned on loans, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities, interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing checking, savings and time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, subordinated debt and other borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the difference between the average yields earned on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities (“net interest spread”) and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income as a percent of total interest-earning assets. The Company’s net interest income, spread and margin are affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand and deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets.
The following table summarizes the Company’s net interest income and margin, on a fully tax-equivalent basis “FTE”, for the periods indicated:

The effect of volume and rate changes on net interest income (on a FTE) for the periods indicated are shown below:
2020 compared to 2019
Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, grew $6.5 million, or 5 percent, in 2020 to $129.3 million from $122.9 million in 2019. The net interest margin was 2.31 percent and 2.63 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 32 basis points year over year. The growth in net interest income was due to increases in the average balance of the Company’s interest-earning assets, especially C&I loans (including PPP loans), and a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and by a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets.
On a fully tax-equivalent basis, interest income on average interest-earning assets decreased $15.8 million, or 9 percent, to $167.5 million in 2020 from $183.3 million in 2019. Average interest- earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $5.59 billion compared to $4.67 billion for 2019, an increase of $923.5 million or 20 percent. The average rate earned on earning assets was 3.00 percent in 2020, compared to 3.93 percent in 2019, a decrease of 93 basis points. The decrease in average yields on interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to a declining rate environment, lower yielding PPP loans and elevated levels of interest-bearing cash and investment securities at lower yields. The one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) has declined by approximately 150 basis points from the beginning of the year. The Federal Open Market Committee also reduced the target Federal Funds rate to 0 percent from 0.25 percent in March 2020 due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. With the transformation to a commercial bank balance sheet and business model, the Company’s interest rate sensitivity models indicate the Company is asset sensitive as of December 31, 2020, and that net interest income would improve in a rising rate environment as our adjustable rate assets have little room to re-price in this low rate environment. The Company believes that our adjustable rate assets will not reprice lower given the floors instituted on our portfolio.
The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019 reflects an increase in the average balance of loans, particularly, in the average balance of C&I and commercial mortgage portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the average balance of the commercial portfolio increased $471.0 million, or 31 percent, from 2019. The increase in this portfolio was primarily attributable to the Company’s participation in the PPP program. The Company originated $596.0 million of PPP loans during the second quarter of 2020, which was partially offset by the sale of $355.0 million of PPP loans in the third quarter of 2020. The Company has also supported growth in the C&I portfolio through: the addition of seasoned bankers including a new EVP, Head of Commercial Banking and an equipment finance team in 2017; a
continued focus on client service and value-added aspects of the lending process; and a continued focus on markets outside of the immediate branch service area, including markets around the Teaneck and Princeton private banking offices. The average balance of the commercial mortgage portfolio was $1.96 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.86 billion in the same period of 2019. The increase in the commercial mortgage portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2020 was to maintain the size of the portfolio in anticipation of maturities in the portfolio in the latter part of 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of the residential mortgage portfolio of $37.2 million to $528.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The average balance of investment securities totaled $519.7 million for 2020 compared to $406.6 million for 2019, reflecting an increase of $113.1 million, or 28 percent. The increase in the average balance of investment securities was due to the purchase of securities to maintain the size of the portfolio in anticipation of maturities for the fourth quarter of 2020 and to utilize excess liquidity generated by the sale of PPP loans in the third quarter of 2020.
The average balance of interest-earning deposits totaled $504.8 million for 2020 compared to $223.6 million for 2019, reflecting an increase of $281.1 million or 126 percent. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits for 2020 was primarily to increase the Company’s balance sheet liquidity in the event of significant depositor withdrawals and/or significant borrower draws on existing unused credit lines due to the environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company plans on reducing the level of interest-earning deposits in 2021 through increased loan originations and investment purchases as liquidity has become less of a concern.
Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $4.32 billion, an increase of $596.1 million, or 16 percent, from $3.73 billion for 2019. The average rate paid decreased 74 basis points to 0.88 percent for 2020 from 1.62 percent for 2019. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was principally due to growth in customer deposits (excluding brokered CDs and brokered interest-bearing demand but including funds from reciprocal deposits) of $467.5 million for 2020 from our branch network; a focus on providing high-touch client service; new deposit relationships related to PPP; and a full array of treasury management products that support core deposit growth. This growth was partially offset by a decline of $45.3 million of brokered deposits.
Average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits for 2020 were 0.74 percent compared to 1.46 percent for 2019, reflecting a decrease of 72 basis points. The decrease in the average rate paid on deposits was principally due to repricing of our deposit base to align with the recent Fed rate decreases.
The average balance of borrowings was $308.8 million for 2020 compared to $137.0 million during 2019, an increase of $171.8 million. The increase in the average balance of borrowings was principally due to the Company’s participation in the PPP Lending Facility (“PPPLF”) as well as a $500.0 million one-month FHLB advance entered in March 2020, which matured in April 2020. The average rates paid on total borrowings decreased to 1.29 percent during 2020 compared to 2.88 percent during 2019, a decrease of 159 basis points. The average rate paid on borrowings was lower for 2020 as the PPPLF borrowings rate was 0.35 percent.
In December 2020, the Company issued $100.0 million of subordinated debt ($98.2 million net of issuance costs) bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.50 percent for the first five years, and thereafter at an adjustable rate until maturity in December 2025 or earlier redemption. In December 2017, the Company issued $35.0 million of subordinated debt ($34.1 million net of issuance costs) bearing interest at an annual rate of 4.75 percent for the first five years, and thereafter at an adjustable rate until maturity in December 2027 or earlier redemption. In June 2016, the Company issued $50.0 million of subordinated debt ($48.7 million net of issuance costs) bearing interest at an annual rate of 6 percent for the first five years, and thereafter at an adjustable rate until maturity in June 2026 or earlier redemption.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES: Investment securities available for sale are purchased, sold and/or maintained as a part of the Company’s overall balance sheet, liquidity and interest rate risk management strategies, and in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, prepayment speeds and/or other factors. These securities are carried at estimated fair value, and unrealized changes in fair value are recognized as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are recognized in income at the time the securities are sold. Equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in non-interest income.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had investment securities available for sale with a fair value of $622.7 million compared with $390.8 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was due to purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government-sponsored securities and SBA pool securities with excess liquidity as deposits and borrowings exceeded loan growth. A net unrealized gain (net of income tax) of $5.5 million and net unrealized loss (net of income tax) of $1.0 million were included in shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company had one equity security (a CRA investment security) with a fair value of $15.1 million and $10.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recorded a $281,000 unrealized gain in securities gains/losses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a $117,000 unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The carrying value of investment securities available for sale at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are shown below:
At December 31, 2020, the Company did not own any securities of any issuer, the aggregate book value of which exceeded 10 percent of shareholders’ equity.

Federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits are an additional part of the Company’s liquidity and interest rate risk management strategies. The combined average balance of these investments during 2020 was $504.9 million compared to $223.7 million in 2019.
LOANS: The loan portfolio represents the largest portion of the Company’s interest-earning assets and is the primary source of interest and fee income. Loans are primarily originated in New Jersey and the boroughs of New York City and, to a lesser extent, Pennsylvania and Delaware. As of December 31, 2020, 45 percent of the total loan portfolio was concentrated in C&I loans (including equipment financing), 26 percent in multifamily loans and 16 percent in commercial mortgages.
Total loans were $4.37 billion and $4.39 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $21.7 million, over the previous year. During 2020, commercial mortgages decreased $70.0 million due to increased paydowns and lower levels of originations compared to 2019. Commercial loans, which includes equipment financing, totaled $1.95 billion at December 31, 2020, increasing $194.5 million, or 11 percent, from 2019. The increase in this portfolio was attributed to loans issued under the PPP, a program under the CARES Act. The December 31, 2020 commercial loan balance includes PPP loans of $195.6 million. Multifamily mortgage loans were $1.13 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $83.1 million or 7 percent when compared to 2019 due to increased paydowns and lower levels of originations compared to 2019.
In late 2015, the Company began originating loans that are partially guaranteed by the SBA, for the purposes of providing working capital and/or, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and that could be used for start-up businesses. All SBA loans are underwritten and documented as prescribed by the SBA. The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans in the secondary market, with the non-guaranteed portion held in the loan portfolio. During 2020, the Bank sold $17.8 million of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans into the secondary market. As of December 31, 2020, the balance of the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans held on our balance sheet totaled $23.7 million and is included in commercial loans.

The Bank believes it addresses the key elements in the risk management framework laid out by its regulators for the effective management of CRE concentration risks.
GOODWILL:
At December 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $33.1 million, an increase of $2.9 million from $30.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in goodwill was due to the acquisitions of wealth management teams and related books of business from Noyes Capital Management and Lucas Capital Management completed in December 2020. The Bank intends to continue to grow its wealth management business through acquisition, as well as organically.
DEPOSITS: At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company reported total deposits of $4.82 billion and $4.24 billion, an increase of $575.0 million, or 14 percent, year over year. The Company’s strategy is to fund a majority of its loan growth with core deposits, which is an important factor in the generation of net interest income. The Company’s average deposits for 2020 increased $703.8 million, or 18 percent, over 2019 average levels to $4.71 billion. The Company saw the largest dollar growth in noninterest-bearing demand and interest-bearing checking balances. The growth in customer deposits (excluding brokered CD and brokered interest-bearing demand deposits, but including reciprocal funds discussed below) has come from an increase in retail deposits from our branch network; a focus on providing high-touch client service; new deposit relationships related to our participation in the PPP; and a full array of treasury management products that support core deposit growth. The Company has also successfully focused on:
•
Growth in deposits associated with its private banking activities, including lending activities; and
•
Business and personal core deposit generation, particularly noninterest-bearing demand and checking.
The Company continues to maintain brokered interest-bearing demand deposits matched to interest rate swaps, thereby extending their duration. Such deposits are generally a more cost-effective alternative to wholesale borrowings and do not require pledging of collateral, as the borrowings do. These deposits decreased to $110.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $180.0 million at the same period in 2019. The Company ensures ample
available collateralized liquidity as a backup to these short-term brokered deposits. At December 31, 2020, there were $110.0 million of notional principal interest rate swaps matched to these deposits for interest rate risk management purposes.
The following table sets forth information concerning the composition of the Company’s average balance of deposits and average interest rates paid for the following years:
The Company is a participant in the Reich & Tang Demand Deposit Marketplace (“DDM”) program and the Promontory Program. The Company uses these deposit sweep services to place customer funds into interest-bearing demand (checking) accounts issued by other participating banks. Customer funds are placed at one or more participating banks to ensure that each deposit customer is eligible for the full amount of FDIC insurance. As a program participant, the Company receives reciprocal amounts of deposits from other participating banks. Reciprocal deposits of $652.5 million, $423.8 million and $434.5 million are included in the Company’s interest-bearing checking deposits as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
The following table shows the maturity for certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES AND OTHER BORROWINGS: As part of our overall funding and liquidity management program, from time to time we borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank. During 2020, the Company also borrowed funds from the Federal Reserve’s PPPLF.
The following table provides a summary of our borrowings as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Short term borrowings consisted of a one-month FHLB advance totaling $15.0 million with a rate of 0.34 percent for the period ended December 31, 2020. The one-month FHLB advance is part of an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge. The cash flow hedge has a term of three years. The Company did not have any overnight borrowings as of December 31, 2020.
The Company prepaid $105.0 million of FHLB advances which had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.20 percent resulting in a prepayment penalty of $4.8 million during 2020. The repayment of the FHLB advances is expected to provide a benefit to interest expense greater than the prepayment penalty over the remaining life of the advances.
The Company had $177.1 million in borrowings from the Federal Reserve’s PPPLF as of December 31, 2020. The borrowings have a rate of 0.35 percent, primarily all of which have a 2-year maturity. The Company utilized the PPPLF to fund PPP loan production earlier in the year. The borrowings are fully pledged by PPP loans as of December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2019, FHLB advances were secured by blanket pledges of certain 1-4 family residential mortgages totaling $347.5 million and multifamily mortgages totaling $773.1 million, while at December 31, 2018, the fixed rate advances were secured by 1-4 family residential mortgages totaling $496.1 million and multifamily mortgages totaling $1.0 billion. Of the FHLB borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019, $113.1 million were short-term borrowings maturing within one year. At December 31, 2019, there was $113.1 million with a rate of 1.81 percent of overnight borrowings with the FHLB, including a one-month FHLB advance for $15.0 million with a rate of 1.79 percent, which is part of an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge. At December 31, 2018, there were no overnight borrowings with the FHLB.
At December 31, 2020, unused short-term or overnight borrowing commitments totaled $1.8 billion from the FHLB, $22.0 million from correspondent banks and $987.7 million at the Federal Reserve Bank.
SUBORDINATED DEBT: In June 2016, the Company issued $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating subordinated notes (the “2016 Notes”) to certain institutional investors. The 2016 Notes are non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of June 30, 2026, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0 percent per year until June 30, 2021. From June 30, 2021 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a level equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 485 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. Debt issuance costs incurred totaled $1.3 million and are being amortized to maturity.
Approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2016 Notes were contributed by the Company to the Bank in the second quarter of 2016. The remaining funds (approximately $10 million) were retained by the Company for operational purposes.
In December 2017, the Company issued $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating subordinated notes (the “2017 Notes”) to certain institutional investors. The 2017 Notes are non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of December 15, 2027, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.75 percent per year until December 15, 2022. From December 16, 2022 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a level equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 254 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. Debt issuance costs incurred totaled $875 thousand and are being amortized to maturity.
Approximately $29.1 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2017 Notes were contributed by the Company to the Bank in the fourth quarter of 2017. The remaining funds of approximately $5 million, representing three years of interest payments, were retained by the Company for operational purposes.
In December 2020, the Company issued $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating subordinates notes (the “2020 Notes”) to certain institutional investors. The 2020 Notes are non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of December 22, 2030, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.50 percent per year until December 22, 2025 From December 23, 2025 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a level equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 326 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. Debt issuance costs incurred totaled $1.8 million and are being amortized to maturity.
The Company plans for the proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes could include stock repurchases, redemption of the 2016 Notes and acquisitions of wealth management firms.
Subordinated debt is presented net of issuance cost on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The subordinated debt issuances are included in the Company’s regulatory total capital amount and ratio.
In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, the Company obtained ratings from KBRA and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”). KBRA assigned investment grade rating of BBB- and Moody’s assigned investment grade rating of Baa3 for the 2020 Notes at the time of issuance.
ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND RELATED PROVISION: The allowance for loan losses was $67.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $43.7 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was 1.54 percent compared to 0.99 percent at December 31, 2019. The provision for loan losses was $32.4 million for 2020, $4.0 million for 2019 and $3.6 million for 2018.
In determining an appropriate amount for the allowance, the Bank segments and evaluates the loan portfolio based on Federal call report codes, which are based on type of collateral. The following portfolio classes have been identified:
a)
Primary Residential Mortgages. The Bank originates one to four family residential mortgage loans in the Tri-State area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut), Pennsylvania and Florida. On a case by case basis, the Bank will lend in additional states. The Bank has developed a portfolio of mortgage products that are used exclusively to attract or maintain wealth, commercial or retail banking relationships. When reviewing residential mortgage loan applications, detailed verifiable information is gathered on income, assets, employment and a tri-merged credit report obtained from a credit repository that will determine total monthly debt obligations. Utilizing an independent appraisal from an approved appraisal management company, the Bank makes residential mortgage loans up to 80 percent of the appraised value and up to 97 percent with private mortgage insurance. Maximum loan-to-value (“LTV”) is determined based on property type and loan amount. On primary residence and second home properties, LTVs range from a maximum of 80 percent for loan amounts to $822,375 for retail customers to 75 percent for loan amounts to $3 million for wealth customers. For investment properties, LTVs range from a maximum of 80 percent for loan amounts to $548,250 for retail customers to 65 percent for loan amounts to $3 million for wealth customers. Loans greater than $3 million will also be considered based on the strength of the overall credit profile of the borrower. Underwriting guidelines include (i) minimum credit report scores of 680 and (ii) a maximum debt to income ratio of 45 percent. The Bank may consider an exception to any guideline if there are strong compensating factors that address and mitigate any risk. Generally, the Bank retains in its portfolio residential mortgage loans with fixed rate maturities of no greater than 7 years, which then convert to annually adjusted floating rates. Community Development loans granted under the Affordable Housing Program are offered with 30-year maturities. Loans with longer maturities or lower credit scores are sold to secondary market investors. The Bank does not originate, purchase or carry any sub-prime mortgage loans.
Risk characteristics associated with primary residential mortgage loans typically involve major living or lifestyle changes to the borrower, including unemployment or other loss of income; unexpected significant expenses, such as for major medical issues or catastrophic events; and divorce or death. In addition, residential mortgage loans that have adjustable rates could expose the borrower to higher debt service requirements in a rising interest rate environment. Further, real estate values could drop significantly and cause the value of the property to fall below the loan amount, creating additional potential exposure for the Bank.
b)
Home Equity Lines of Credit. The Bank provides revolving lines of credit against one to four family residences in the Tri-State area. These loans are primarily in a second lien position, but may be used as a first lien, in lieu of a primary residential first mortgage. When reviewing home equity line of credit applications, the Bank collects detailed verifiable information regarding income, assets, employment and a credit report that will determine total monthly debt obligations. The Bank uses an automated valuation model on all lines up to $250,000 and obtains an independent appraisal of the subject property on all applications exceeding $250,000. LTVs and combined LTVs are capped at 80 percent if the property type is a primary residence. These loans may be subordinate to a first mortgage which may be from another lending institution. The Bank requires that the mortgage securing the home equity line of credit be no lower than a second lien position. All applications for home equity lines of credit adhere to applicable underwriting standards and guidelines. Exceptions can be made to these guidelines with compensating factors that address and mitigate the risk associated with the exception.
Primary risk characteristics associated with home equity lines of credit typically involve major living or lifestyle changes to the borrower, including unemployment or other loss of income; unexpected significant expenses, such as for major medical issues or catastrophic events; and divorce or death. In addition, home equity lines of credit typically are made with variable or floating interest rates, such as the Prime Rate,
which could expose the borrower to higher debt service requirements in a rising interest rate environment. Further, real estate values could drop significantly and cause the value of the property to fall below the loan amount, creating additional potential exposure for the Bank.
c)
Junior Lien Loan on Residence. The Bank provides junior lien loans (“JLL”) against one to four family properties in the Tri-State area. Junior lien loans can be either in the form of an amortizing fixed rate home equity loan or a revolving home equity line of credit. These loans are subordinate to a first mortgage which may be from another lending institution. The Bank will require that the mortgage securing the JLL be no lower than a second lien position. When reviewing the JLL application, the Bank collects detailed verifiable information regarding income, assets, employment and a credit report that determines total monthly debt obligations. The Bank uses an automated valuation model on all JLLs up to $250,000 and obtains an independent appraisal of the subject property on all applications exceeding $250,000. LTVs and combined LTVs are capped at 75 percent if the property type is a primary residence. All applications for JLLs adhere to applicable underwriting standards and guidelines. Exceptions can be made to these guidelines with compensating factors that address and mitigate the risk associated with the exception. Primary risk characteristics associated with JLLs typically involve major living or lifestyle changes to the borrower, including unemployment or other loss of income; unexpected significant expenses, such as for major medical issues or catastrophic events; and divorce or death. Further, real estate values could drop significantly and cause the value of the property to fall below the loan amount, creating additional potential exposure for the Bank.
d)
Multifamily Loans. Multifamily loans are commercial mortgages on residential apartment buildings. Within the multifamily sector, the Bank’s primary focus is to lend against larger non-luxury apartment buildings and rent regulated properties with at least 30 units that are owned and managed by experienced sponsors. As of December 31, 2020, the average property size in the portfolio was 46 units.
Multifamily loans are expected to be repaid from the cash flows of the underlying property so the collective amount of rents must be sufficient to cover all operating expense, maintenance, taxes and debt service. The Bank includes debt service coverage covenants in these loans and the average ratio at original underwriting was about 1.5x. Increases in vacancy rates, interest rates or other changes in general economic conditions can all have an impact on the borrower and their ability to repay the loan. Certain markets, such as the Boroughs of New York City, are rent regulated, and as such, feature rents that are considered to be below market rates. Generally, rent regulated properties are characterized by relatively stable occupancy levels and longer-term tenants. As a loan asset class for many banks, multifamily loans have experienced much lower historical loss rates compared to other types of commercial lending.
The Bank’s loan policy allows loan to appraised value ratios of up to 75 percent and the overall portfolio average loan to value ratio was approximately 57 percent at December 31, 2020. The majority of all new originations have a ten-year maturity with a five-year reprice.
Multifamily loan terms include prepayment penalties and generally require that the Bank escrow for real estate taxes. Multifamily loans will typically have a minimum debt service coverage ratio that provides for an adequate cushion for unexpected or uncertain events and changes in market conditions. In the loan underwriting process, the Bank requires an independent appraisal and review, appropriate environmental due diligence and an assessment of the property’s condition.
Multifamily properties generally present a lower level of risk as compared to investment commercial real estate projects given that there are a larger number of tenants in the property. The repayment of loans secured by multifamily real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flows from the property are reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term), the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
e)
Commercial Real Estate Loans. The Bank provides mortgage loans for commercial real estate that is either owner occupied or managed as an investment property (non-owner occupied).
The terms and conditions of all commercial mortgage loans are tailored to the specific attributes of the borrower and any guarantors as well as the nature of the property and loan purpose. In the case of investment commercial real estate properties, the Bank reviews, among other things, the composition and mix of the underlying tenants, terms and conditions of the underlying tenant lease agreements, the resources and experience of the sponsor, and the condition and location of the subject property.
Commercial real estate loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk than multifamily loans as they may be dependent on the ongoing success and operating viability of a fewer number of tenants who are occupying the property and who may have a greater degree of exposure to various industry or economic conditions. To mitigate this risk, the Bank generally requires an assignment of leases, direct recourse to the owners, and a risk appropriate interest rate and loan structure. In underwriting an investment commercial real estate loan, the Bank evaluates the property’s historical operating income as well as its projected sustainable cash flows and generally requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio that provides for an adequate cushion for unexpected or uncertain events and changes in market conditions.
With an owner-occupied property, a detailed credit assessment is made of the operating business since its ongoing success and profitability will be the primary source of repayment. While owner-occupied properties include the real estate as collateral, the risk assessment of the operating business is more similar to the underwriting of commercial and industrial loans (described below). The Bank evaluates factors such as, but not limited to, the expected sustainability of profits and cash flows, the depth and experience of management and ownership, the nature of competition, and the impact of forces like regulatory change and evolving technology.
The Bank’s policy allows loan to appraised value ratios of up to 75 percent. Commercial mortgage loans are generally made with an initial fixed rate with periodic rate resets every five or seven years over an underlying market index. Resets may not be automatic and subject to re-approval. Commercial mortgage loan terms include prepayment penalties and generally require that the Bank escrow for real estate taxes. The Bank requires an independent appraisal, an assessment of the property’s condition, and appropriate environmental due diligence. With all commercial real estate loans, the Bank’s standard practice is to require a depository relationship.
f)
Commercial and Industrial Loans. The Bank provides lines of credit and term loans to operating companies for business purposes. The loans are generally secured by business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, business vehicles and equipment. In addition, these loans often include commercial real estate as collateral to strengthen the Bank’s position and further mitigate risk. When underwriting business loans, among other things, the Bank evaluates the historical profitability and debt servicing capacity of the borrowing entity and the financial resources and character of the principal owners and guarantors.
Commercial and industrial loans are typically repaid first by the cash flows generated by the borrower’s business. The primary risk characteristics are specific to the underlying business and its ability to generate sustainable profitability and resulting positive cash flows. Factors that may influence a business’ profitability include, but are not limited to, demand for its products or services, quality and depth of management, degree of competition, regulatory changes, and general economic conditions. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by business assets; however, the ability of the Bank to foreclose and realize sufficient value from the assets is often highly uncertain. To mitigate the risk characteristics of commercial and industrial loans, the Bank often requires more frequent reporting requirements from the borrower in order to better monitor its business performance.
g)
Leasing and Equipment Finance. Peapack Capital Corporation (“PCC”), a subsidiary of the Bank, offers a range of finance solutions nationally. PCC provides term loans and leases secured by assets financed for U.S. based mid-size and large companies. Facilities tend to be fully drawn under fixed-rate terms. PCC serves a broad range of industries including transportation, manufacturing, heavy construction and utilities.
Asset risk in PCC’s portfolio is generally recognized through changes to loan income, or through changes to lease- related income streams due to fluctuations in lease rates. Changes to lease income can occur when the existing lease contract expires, the asset comes off lease, or the business seeks to enter a new lease agreement. Asset risk may also change depreciation, resulting from changes in the residual value of the
operating lease asset or through impairment of the asset carrying value, which can occur at any time during the life of the asset.
Credit risk in PCC’s portfolio generally results from the potential default of borrowers or lessees, which may be driven by customer specific or broader industry related conditions. Credit losses can impact multiple parts of the income statement including loss of interest/lease/rental income and/or via higher costs and expenses related to the repossession, refurbishment, re-marketing and or re-leasing of assets.
h)
Consumer and Other. These are loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures as well as obligations of states and political subdivisions in the U.S. This also represents all other loans that cannot be categorized in any of the previous mentioned loan segments. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter terms than residential loans but tend to have higher credit risk due to the type of collateral securing the loan or in some cases the absence of collateral.
Bank Management believes that the underwriting guidelines previously described adequately address the primary risk characteristics. Further, the Bank has dedicated staff and system resources to monitor and collect on any potentially problematic loans.
The provision for loan losses is based upon Management’s review and evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, level and trend of delinquencies and charge-offs, general market and economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, and the existence and fair value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans. Although Management used the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, the majority of the Company’s loans are secured by real estate in the State of New Jersey and the New York City metropolitan area. Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the Company’s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in these areas and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or if the geographic areas serviced experience adverse economic conditions. Future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the Company’s control.
The following table presents the loan loss experience, by loan type, during the years ended December 31:
(A)
The December 31, 2020 ALLL coverage ratios include PPP loans of $195.6 million.
The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses and the percentage of each loan category, by collateral type, to total loans as of December 31, of the years indicated:
The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020 totaled $67.3 million compared to $43.7 million at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.53 percent as of December 31, 2020 and 0.99 percent as of December 31, 2019. The provision for loan losses made during 2020 totaled $32.4 million compared with $4.0 million for 2019. The increased provision for loan and lease losses primarily reflected the economic environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased qualitative loss factors when calculating the allowance for loan losses. The Company’s provision for loan and lease losses (and its allowance for loan and leases losses) also reflect the Company’s assessment of asset quality metrics, net loan decline, increased net charge-offs, and the composition of the loan portfolio. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020 represents a reasonable estimate for probable incurred losses in the portfolio at that date. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted new accounting guidance, which requires the Company to estimate CECL. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing its implementation of controls and processes and performing model validation which could affect the final impact of the adoption of this standard.
The portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans collectively evaluated for impairment, commonly referred to as general reserves, was $64.6 million at December 31, 2020 and $40.9 million at December 31, 2019.
General reserves at December 31, 2020 represents 1.47 percent of loans collectively evaluated for impairment compared to 0.93 percent at December 31, 2019. The specific reserves on impaired loans were $2.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $2.8 million at December 31, 2019. Specific reserves were attributable to a $2.7 million reserve associated with one commercial banking relationship totaling $5.0 million at December 31, 2020.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 589.91 percent due to a $32.4 million provision for loan losses partially offset by net charge-offs of $8.8 million due to the reasons noted above. Nonperforming loans decreased from $28.9 million to $11.4 million during the year. Nonperforming loans decreased primarily due to the transfer of several residential and commercial loans totaling $18.5 million that were transferred to held for sale during 2020. Nonperforming loans are specifically evaluated for impairment. Also, the Company commonly records partial charge-offs of the excess of the principal balance over the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of collateral for collateral-dependent impaired loans. As a result, the allowance for loan losses does not always change proportionately with changes in nonperforming loans. The Company charged off $6.0 million on loans identified as collateral-dependent impaired loans during 2020, which included a $4.7 million charge-off related to an assisted living facility compared to $80,000 during 2019.
ASSET QUALITY:
The following table presents various asset quality data at the dates indicated. These tables do not include loans held for sale.
(1)
The decrease in nonaccrual loans for 2020 was due to the transfer of several commercial and residential loans totaling $18.5 million to held for sale. The increase in nonaccrual loans for 2019 and 2018 was due to the addition of one healthcare real estate secured loan, totaling $14.5 million with a $1.0 million reserve, as of December 31, 2020.
Some borrowers have found it difficult to make their loan payments under contractual terms. In some of these cases, the Company has chosen to grant concessions and modify certain loan terms, which may be characterized as troubled debt restructurings. The CARES Act granted relief to borrowers that needed loan deferrals due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Loan Modifications discussion below for details regarding the Company’s treatment of loan deferrals in 2020.
At December 31, 2020, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans were classified as nonperforming.
Loan Modifications: The CARES Act allows financial institutions to suspend application of certain current TDR accounting guidance under ASC 310-40 for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency, provided certain criteria are met. This relief can be applied to loan modifications for borrowers that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and to loan modifications that defer or delay the payment of principal or interest or change the interest rate on the loan. In April 2020, federal and state banking regulators issued the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus to provide further interpretation of when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, specifically indicating that if the modification is either short-term (e.g., six months) or mandated by a federal or state government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulty under ASC 310-40.
Throughout 2020, the Bank had modified 536 loans with a balance of $946.3 million resulting in the deferral of principal and/or interest for periods ranging from 90 to 180 days. The table below summarizes the outstanding deferrals as of December 31, 2020. All of these loans were performing in accordance with their terms prior to modifications and are in conformance with the CARES Act. Included in the table below are two loans totaling $29.3 million of loan level swaps. Details with respect to loan modifications are as follows:
The future performance of these loans, specifically beyond the term of the deferral, is uncertain. To recognize a credit allowance commensurate with the existing risk, the Company assigned qualitative factors for each of the above portfolio classes for allowance purposes.
TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS: The following table presents the troubled debt restructured loans, by collateral type, at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
At December 31, 2020, there were $4.0 million of troubled debt restructured loans included in nonaccrual loans above compared to $25.8 million at December 31, 2019. All troubled debt restructured loans are considered and included in impaired loans at December 31, 2020 and had specific reserves of $3,000. At December 31, 2019, all troubled debt restructured loans were considered and included in impaired loans and had specific reserves of $2.8 million.
Except as disclosed, the Company did not have any potential problem loans at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019 that caused Management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans.
Impaired loans totaled $16.2 million and $35.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans of $11.4 million and $28.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Impaired loans also include accruing troubled debt restructuring loans of $201,000 at December 31, 2020 and $2.4 million at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents impaired loans, by collateral type, at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(1)
The decrease was primarily due to the transfer of one loan totaling $10.0 million related to an assisted living facility to held for sale during 2020.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS: The following table shows the significant contractual obligations of the Company by expected payment period, as of December 31, 2020:
Leases represent obligations entered into by the Company for the use of land and premises. The leases generally have escalation terms based upon certain defined indexes. Common area maintenance charges may also apply and are adjusted annually based on the terms of the lease agreements. The Company adopted the guidance in Topic 842 Leases effective January 1, 2019. See Note 1 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Purchase obligations represent legally binding and enforceable agreements to purchase goods and services from third parties and consist of contractual obligations under data processing service agreements. The Company also enters into various routine rental and maintenance contracts for facilities and equipment. These contracts are generally for one year.
The Company is a limited partner in a Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”). As of December 31, 2020, the Company had unfunded commitments of $1.1 million for its investment in SBIC qualified funds.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS: The following table shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments, consisting primarily of letters of credit, as of December 31, 2020.
Commitments under standby letters of credit, both financial and performance, do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon.
OTHER INCOME: The following table presents the major components of other income (excluding income from our wealth management operations, which is discussed separately):
2020 compared to 2019
The Company recorded total other income of $20.9 million, excluding wealth management fee income, reflecting an increase of $4.6 million, or 28 percent, compared to 2019 levels. The increase for 2020 was primarily attributable to a $7.4 million gain on sale of $355.0 million of PPP loans in 2020 partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in capital market activity (mortgage banking income, fee income related to loan level, back-to-back swaps, and gain on sale of SBA loans).
Income from the sale of newly originated residential mortgages loans increased $2.5 million to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to $721,000 for the same period in 2019. Such income was a result of the increased volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale during 2020 due to significant increase in refinance activity in the current low rate environment.
Fee income related to loan level, back-to-back swaps was $1.6 million for 2020 compared to $5.8 million in 2019. The decrease was a result of decreased demand for this product due to the rate environment in 2020. The program provides a borrower with a degree of interest rate protection on a variable rate loan, while still providing an adjustable rate to the Company, thus helping to manage the Company’s interest rate risk, while contributing to income.
The Company provides loans that are partially guaranteed by the SBA, for the purposes of providing working capital and/or financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and that could be used for start-up business. All SBA loans are underwritten and documented as prescribed by the SBA. The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans in the secondary market, with the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans held in the loan portfolio. Gain on sale of SBA loans for 2020 decreased by $379,000 to $1.8 million of income related to the Company’s SBA lending and sale program from $2.1 million in 2019.
Income from the back-to-back swap and SBA programs are dependent on volume, and thus are not linear from year to year, as some years will be higher than others.
OPERATING EXPENSES: The following table presents the major components of operating expenses:
2020 compared to 2019
Operating expenses totaled $125.0 million in 2020, compared to $104.8 million in 2019, reflecting an increase of $20.1 million, or 19 percent. Increased operating expenses in 2020 were principally attributable to: compensation and employee benefits increase of $7.4 million which includes expenses related to the Point View acquisition completed on September 1, 2019; hiring in line with the Company’s strategic plan and normal salary increases; a $4.4 million valuation allowance for a loan held for sale; $4.8 million for the prepayment of FHLB advances; $278,000 for the closure of a retail branch; and $210,000 for the consolidation of two private banking locations. Further during 2020, FDIC expense increased $1.7 million due to credits applied in 2019 which were available to the banking industry in general. FDIC expense was also impacted by asset growth which negatively affected certain ratios used in calculating the assessment rate.
INCOME TAXES: Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.8 million as compared to $18.7 million for 2019. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 18.16 percent as compared to 28.26 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective rate for 2020 was primarily due to a $3.0 million Federal income tax benefit that resulted from a tax NOL carryback. The Company had a $23 million operating loss for tax purposes in 2018 (when the Federal tax rate was 21 percent) resulting from accelerated tax depreciation. Under the CARES Act, the Company was allowed to carry this NOL back to a period when the Federal tax rate was 35 percent, generating a permanent tax benefit.
The 2019 New Jersey Budget (“Budget”) established a 2.5 percent surtax on businesses that have New Jersey allocated net income in excess of $1.0 million. The surtax was effective as of January 1, 2018 and continues through 2020. In September 2020, New Jersey extended the surtax through December 31, 2023. In addition, effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, banks will be required to file combined reports of taxable income including their parent holding company. New Jersey requires entities to report their real estate investment trust, registered investment company and investment company on a separate entity basis.
CAPITAL RESOURCES: A solid capital base provides the Company with financial strength and the ability to support future growth and is essential to executing the Company’s Strategic Plan - “Expanding Our Reach.” The Company’s capital strategy is intended to provide stability to expand its businesses, even in stressed environments. Quarterly stress testing is integral to the Company’s capital management process.
The Company strives to maintain capital levels in excess of internal “triggers” and in excess of those considered to be well capitalized under regulatory guidelines applicable to banks and bank holding companies. Maintaining an adequate capital position supports the Company’s goal of providing shareholders an attractive and stable long-term return on investment.
The Company’s capital position during 2020 was benefitted by net income of $26.2 million partially offset by the purchase of shares of $6.5 million through the Company’s stock repurchase program.
The Company employs quarterly capital stress testing - adverse case and severely adverse case. In the December 31, 2020 severely, adverse case, no growth scenario, the Bank remains well capitalized over a two-year stress period. With a Pandemic stress overlay, the Bank still remains well capitalized over the two-year stress period.
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s GAAP capital as a percent of total assets was 8.95 percent. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s regulatory leverage, common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.53 percent, 11.93 percent, 11.93 percent and 17.67 percent, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s regulatory leverage, common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.71 percent, 13.55 percent, 13.55 percent and 14.81 percent, respectively. The Bank’s regulatory capital ratios are all above the ratios to be considered well capitalized under regulatory guidance.
As a result of the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies are required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9 percent, effective January 1, 2020. Under the CARES Act, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio was temporarily lowered to 8 percent. The Bank did not opt into the CBLR and will continue to comply with the requirements under Basel III.
To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, common equity Tier I and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table.
The Bank’s regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table:

The Basel Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain a 2.5 percent “capital conservation buffer” on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets or (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets above the respective minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall.
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan of Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation, or the “Reinvestment Plan,” allows shareholders of the Company to purchase additional shares of common stock using cash dividends without payment of any brokerage commissions or other charges. Shareholders may also make voluntary cash payments of up to $200,000 per quarter to purchase additional shares of common stock, which up to January 30, 2019 were purchased at a three percent discount to market. On January 30, 2019, the Company eliminated the three percent discount feature. Voluntary share purchases in the “Reinvestment Plan” can be filled from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares and/or in the open market, at the discretion of the Company. All shares purchased through the Plan in both 2020 and 2019 were purchased in the open market. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 542,302 of the shares purchased for the “Reinvestment Plan” were from authorized but unissued shares, while 778,407 shares were purchased in the open market. Such optional cash purchases provided $16.7 million of common equity in 2018.
Management believes the Company’s capital position and capital ratios are adequate. Further, Management believes the Company has sufficient common equity to support its planned growth and expansion for the immediate future. The Company continually assesses other potential sources of capital to support future growth.
LIQUIDITY: Liquidity refers to an institution’s ability to meet short-term requirements including funding of loans, deposit withdrawals and maturing obligations, as well as long-term obligations, including potential capital expenditures. The Company’s liquidity risk management is intended to ensure the Company has adequate funding and liquidity to support its assets across a range of market environments and conditions, including stressed conditions. Principal sources of liquidity include cash, temporary investments, securities available for sale, customer deposit inflows, loan repayments and secured borrowings. Other liquidity sources include loan sales and loan participations.
Management actively monitors and manages the Company’s liquidity position and believes it is sufficient to meet future needs. Cash and cash equivalents, including federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits, totaled $653.3 million at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company had $622.7 million in securities designated as available for sale at December 31, 2020. These securities can be sold, or used as collateral for borrowings, in response to liquidity concerns. Securities available for sale with a fair value of $598.3 million as of December 31, 2020 were pledged to secure public funds and for other purposes required or permitted by law. However, only $10.2 million of that total is actually encumbered. In addition, the Company generates significant liquidity from scheduled and unscheduled principal repayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s balance sheet liquidity was funded by increased client deposits of $644.9 million and $177.1 million in borrowings through the PPPLF. The Federal Reserve has supplied a source of liquidity to participating financial institutions through the PPPLF, which extends credit to eligible financial institutions, at a rate of 0.35 percent, taking the PPP loans as collateral at face value. The Company utilized this facility to fund its PPP loans.
As of December 31, 2020, in addition to the $1.3 billion of balance sheet liquidity, the Company also had approximately $1.8 billion of secured funding from the FHLB and $987.7 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, none of which was drawn.
Brokered interest-bearing demand (“overnight”) deposits decreased $70.0 million to $110.0 million at December 31, 2020. The interest rate paid on these deposits allowed the Bank to fund operations at attractive rates and engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its asset-liability interest rate risk. The Company ensures ample available collateralized liquidity as a backup to these short-term brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has transacted pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps totaling $270.0 million in notional amount.
The Company has a Board-approved Contingency Funding Plan. This plan provides a framework for managing adverse liquidity stress and contingent sources of liquidity. The Company conducts liquidity stress testing on a regular basis to ensure sufficient liquidity in a stressed environment. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity given the current environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Management believes the Company’s liquidity position and sources are adequate.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES: The financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than do general levels of inflation.
PEAPACK PRIVATE: The Peapack Private division includes: investment management services provided for individuals and institutions; personal trust services, including services as executor, trustee, administrator, custodian and guardian, and other financial planning, tax preparation and advisory services. Officers from Peapack Private are available to provide wealth management, trust and investment services at the Bank’s headquarters in Bedminster, at private banking locations in Morristown, Princeton, Red Bank and Teaneck, New Jersey and at the Bank’s subsidiaries, PGB Trust & Investments of Delaware in Greenville, Delaware, Lassus Wherley & Associates (“Lassus Wherley”), in New Providence, New Jersey and Bonita Springs, Florida and Point View Wealth Management (“Point View”) in Summit, New Jersey.
The following table presents certain key aspects of the Peapack Private’s performance for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
2020 compared to 2019
The market value of assets under management and/or administration (“AUM”) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $8.8 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, an increase of 17 percent year-over-year. This includes assets held at the Bank at December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $426.1 million and $208.6 million, respectively. The increase in AUM was due to the acquisition of two registered investment advisory firms (“RIA”) and net organic growth during 2020, as well as market value appreciation. Effective December 18, 2020, the Bank completed the lift out of teams from Lucas Capital Management, based in Red Bank, NJ, and from Noyes Capital Management, based in New Vernon, NJ, which combined contributed approximately $400 million of AUM/AUA at the time of acquisition. Net organic growth and equity market appreciation contributed an additional $900 million in AUM.
Peapack Private management fees increased $2.5 million or 7 percent to $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $38.4 million in 2019. The growth in fee income was due to several factors, including the acquisitions noted above, as well as continued new business, partially offset by normal levels of disbursements and outflows.
Peapack Private expenses increased to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $32.2 million for 2019, an increase of $3.0 million, or 9 percent. Other operating expenses increased $741,000 or 7 percent to $11.7
million for the year ended 2020 when compared to 2019. Compensation and benefits expense totaled $23.5 million and $21.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, increasing $2.3 million or 11 percent. Operating expenses relative to Peapack Private reflected increases due to a full year of expenses from Point View, acquired effective September 1, 2019 and overall growth in the business, new hires and select third party expenditures. Remaining expenses are in line with the Company’s Strategic Plan, particularly the hiring of key management and revenue-producing personnel. Generally, revenue and profitability related to the new personnel will lag expenses by several quarters.
Peapack Private currently generates adequate revenue to support the salaries, benefits and other expenses of the wealth division; however, Management believes that the Bank generates adequate liquidity to support the expenses of Peapack Private should it be necessary.
