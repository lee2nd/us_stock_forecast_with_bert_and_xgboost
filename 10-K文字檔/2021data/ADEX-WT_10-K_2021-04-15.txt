Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We have not identified any specific target business and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any target business regarding an initial business combination with our company. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination:
•
may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
•
may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
•
could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present management team;
•
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and
•
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and/or warrants.
Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:
•
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
•
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
•
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;
•
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants;
•
restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;
•
our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
•
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes;
•
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
•
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;
•
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and
•
other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
On January 14, 2021, we completed our IPO of 24,000,000 units. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, and one-half of one redeemable Warrant, each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, pursuant to the Company’s registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-251641 and 333-252021). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000.
On January 14, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we completed a private placement of an aggregate of 6,550,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,550,000.
A total of $240,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.
On January 15, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, and on January 19, 2021, the underwriters purchased an additional 3,600,000 Units at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional Units, the Company sold an additional 720,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $720,000. As of January 19, 2021, an aggregate amount of $276,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the additional 3,600,000 Units and additional 720,000 Private Placement Warrants) were deposited in the Company’s trust account established in connection with the IPO.
We paid a total of $ 5,520,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions and $636,086 for other costs and expenses related to the IPO.
Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after the IPO. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially following the closing of the IPO.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from October 15, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the IPO, described below. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
Until the consummation of the IPO, our liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to the completion of the IPO through receipt of $25,000 from the sale of the founder shares and loans to us of up to $150,000 by our sponsor under an unsecured promissory note. As of April 14, 2021, $150,000 was outstanding under the promissory note governing the loan.
On January 14, 2021, we completed our IPO of 24,000,000 units. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, and one-half of one redeemable Warrant, each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, pursuant to the Company’s registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-251641 and 333-252021). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000.
On January 14, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed a private placement of an aggregate of 6,550,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,550,000.
A total of $240,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.
On January 15, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, and on January 19, 2021, the underwriters purchased an additional 3,600,000 Units at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional Units, the Company sold an additional 720,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $720,000.
Following the IPO, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $276,000,000 was placed in the trust account and, following the payment of certain transaction expenses, we had $1,000,000 of cash held outside of the trust account and available for working capital purposes. We incurred $6,156,086 in IPO related costs, including $5,520,000 of underwriting fees and $636,086 of other expenses.
We may withdraw interest earned on the funds held in the trust account to pay our tax obligations. We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations, based on the number of shares of our common stock authorized and outstanding to be $200,000, which is the maximum per annum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay personnel affiliated with our sponsor, or reimburse affiliates of our sponsor for the use of personnel for services related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination, and/or commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. To the extent any amounts are in respect of the services of individuals who also serve as directors, industry advisors or executive officers of our company, such amounts will be reviewed and approved by our audit committee.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our initial stockholders, officers, directors, and industry advisors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest basis as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our initial stockholders, officers, directors, industry advisors or their affiliates as we do not believe other third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
At December 31, 2020, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company”, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of the IPO or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our audited financial information. We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this report. Our audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates.
