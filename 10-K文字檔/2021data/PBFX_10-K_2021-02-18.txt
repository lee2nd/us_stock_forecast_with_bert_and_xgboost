ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Acquisitions from PBF were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, our financial information, and that of our Predecessor, contained herein has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired in the Acquisitions from PBF prior to the effective date of each acquisition for all periods presented with the exception of the Delaware Ethanol Storage Facility, which is considered an asset purchase.
With the exception of revenue generated by the DCR Products Pipeline and the Paulsboro Lube Oil Terminal, our Predecessor generally recognized only the costs and did not record revenue for transactions with PBF Energy prior to the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF. Affiliate revenue has been recorded for certain of our assets in the Transportation and Terminaling and Storage segments subsequent to the commencement of the commercial agreements with PBF Energy upon completion of the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF. Refer to “Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information. Refer to “Overview” in “Item 1. Business” for further information regarding the Acquisitions from PBF.

Overview
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented, Delaware master limited partnership formed in February 2013 by subsidiaries of PBF Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBF GP is our general partner and is wholly-owned by PBF LLC. PBF Energy is the sole managing member of PBF LLC and, as of December 31, 2020, owned 99.2% of the total economic interest in PBF LLC. As of December 31, 2020, PBF LLC held a 48.0% limited partner interest in us, with the remaining 52.0% limited partner interest owned by public unitholders.
Our business includes the assets, liabilities and results of operations of certain crude oil, refined products, natural gas and intermediates terminaling, pipeline, storage and processing assets, including those previously operated and owned by PBF Holding’s subsidiaries and PBF Holding’s previously held subsidiaries. Refer to “Item 1. Business” of this Form 10-K for more detailed information regarding our business and assets.
Business Developments
Refer to “Business Developments” included in “Item 1. Business” of this Form 10-K for discussion regarding our business developments during the fiscal year 2020.
Principles of Combination and Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
Our Predecessor did not historically operate its assets for the purpose of generating revenue independent of other PBF Energy businesses that we support, with the exception of the DCR Products Pipeline and the Paulsboro Lube Oil Terminal. In connection with the closing of the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF, we entered into commercial and service agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy, under which we operate our assets for the purpose of generating fee-based revenue. We receive, handle and transfer crude oil, refined products and natural gas from sources located throughout the U.S. and Canada and store crude oil, refined products and intermediates for PBF Energy in support of its refineries located in Paulsboro, New Jersey; Delaware City, Delaware; Toledo, Ohio; Chalmette, Louisiana; Torrance, California; and Martinez, California. In 2020, PBF Energy reconfigured its Delaware and Paulsboro refineries, temporarily idling certain of its major processing units at the Paulsboro Refinery, in order to operate the two refineries as one functional unit referred to as the “East Coast Refining System.” We acquired various terminal, pipeline and storage assets from PBF Energy, which are integral components of the crude oil, refined products and natural gas delivery and storage operations at PBF Energy’s refineries. In addition, we generate third-party revenue from certain of our assets.
The consolidated financial statements presented in this Form 10-K include our consolidated financial results as of and for the period ending December 31, 2020. We have retrospectively adjusted our financial information contained herein to include the historical results of the Acquisitions from PBF prior to the effective date of each transaction including the Development Assets, with the exception of the Delaware Ethanol Storage Facility as it is considered an asset purchase, prior to the acquisition of the Development Assets.
Business Strategies
We continue to focus on the following strategic areas:
How We Evaluate Our Operations
Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our business and segment performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include, but are not limited to, volumes, including terminal and pipeline throughput and storage capacity; operating and maintenance expenses; and EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. We define EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow below.
Volumes. The amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil, refined products and natural gas that we throughput at our terminaling and pipeline operations and our available and utilized storage capacity. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, refined products and natural gas in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Although PBF Energy has committed to minimum volumes under certain commercial agreements, our results of operations will be impacted by:
•PBF Energy’s utilization of our assets in excess of MVCs;
•our ability to identify and execute accretive acquisitions and organic expansion projects and capture incremental PBF Energy or third-party volumes; and
•our ability to increase throughput volumes at our facilities and provide additional ancillary services at those terminals and pipelines.
Operating and Maintenance Expenses. Our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses are comprised primarily of labor and outside contractor costs, utilities, insurance premiums, repairs and maintenance charges
and related property taxes. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses. We will seek to manage our maintenance expenditures on our assets by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenditures and to minimize their impact on our cash flow.
EBITDA, EBITDA Attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense (including amortization of loan fees and debt premium and accretion on discounted liabilities), income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and change in contingent consideration. We define EBITDA attributable to PBFX as net income (loss) attributable to PBFX before net interest expense (including amortization of loan fees and debt premium and accretion on discounted liabilities), income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and change in contingent consideration attributable to PBFX, which excludes the results of Acquisitions from PBF prior to the effective dates of such transactions and earnings attributable to the CPI earn-out (the portion of earnings associated with an earn-out provision related to the purchase of CPI). We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA attributable to PBFX excluding acquisition and transaction costs, non-cash unit-based compensation expense and items that meet the conditions of unusual, infrequent and/or non-recurring charges. We define distributable cash flow as EBITDA attributable to PBFX plus non-cash unit-based compensation expense, less cash interest, maintenance capital expenditures attributable to PBFX and income taxes. Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances. EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP.
EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:
•our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA, financing methods;
•the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
•the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the economic returns on various investment opportunities.
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and assists in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for current and comparative periods. We believe that the presentation of distributable cash flow will provide useful information to investors as it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare partnership performance and provides investors with another perspective on the operating performance of our assets and the cash our business is generating. EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, income from operations, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. EBITDA, EBITDA attributable to PBFX, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are reconciled to net income and net cash provided by operating activities in this Form 10-K in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations.”
Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results
Our results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations due to our acquisition activity, which is discussed in Note 4 “Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K, the IDR Restructuring, certain debt and equity transactions and our annual inflation adjustment to our commercial agreements. Additionally, our results may not be comparative to prior periods due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in 2020, including lower throughput volumes at our terminals, as the industry reacts to the related economic downturn and volatile commodity market.
Furthermore, our results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations due to the termination of the CPI Processing Agreement, which resulted in an impairment charge of $7.0 million to write-down the related processing unit assets and customer contract intangible asset of $3.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Refer to Note 6 “Property, Plant and Equipment, Net” and Note 7 “Goodwill and Intangibles” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Approximately $35.2 million of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the CPI Processing Agreement.
Other Factors That Will Significantly Affect Our Results
Supply and Demand for Crude Oil, Refined Products and Natural Gas. We generate revenue by charging fees for receiving, handling, transferring, storing, throughputting and processing crude oil, refined products and natural gas. A majority of our revenue is derived from MVC, fee-based commercial agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy with initial terms ranging from one to fifteen years, which enhance the stability of our cash flows. The volume of crude oil, refined products and natural gas that is throughput depends substantially on PBF Energy’s operational needs which are largely impacted by refining margins. Refining margins are greatly dependent upon the price of crude oil or other refinery feedstocks, refined products and natural gas.
Factors driving the prices of petroleum-based commodities include supply and demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products. Supply and demand for these products depend on numerous factors outside of our control, including changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, logistics constraints, availability of imports, marketing of competitive fuels, crude oil price differentials and government regulation. The impact of the unprecedented global health and economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic was amplified late in the first quarter of 2020 due to movements made by the world’s largest oil producers to increase market share. This created simultaneous shocks in oil supply and demand resulting in an economic challenge to our industry which has not occurred since our formation. These factors have resulted in significant demand destruction for refined petroleum products and atypical volatility in oil commodity prices through the end of 2020 and may continue for the foreseeable future. Although the effects may be mitigated by MVC provisions in certain of our commercial contracts, this overall demand destruction and market environment could lead to lower storage or throughput volumes processed at our assets, which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. While it is impossible to estimate the duration or complete financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the negative impacts and risk to us may be mitigated through our MVCs within the commercial agreements with PBF Holding. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for more information on factors affecting margins and commodity pricing.
Acquisition and Organic Growth Opportunities. We may acquire additional logistics assets from PBF Energy or third parties. Under our Omnibus Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we have a right of first offer on certain logistics assets owned by PBF Energy to the extent PBF Energy decides to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of those assets. We also have a right of first offer to acquire additional logistics assets that PBF Energy may construct or acquire in the future. Our commercial agreements provide us with options to
purchase certain assets at PBF Holding’s refineries related to our business in the event PBF Energy permanently shuts down PBF Holding’s refineries. In addition, our commercial agreements provide us with the right to use certain assets at PBF Holding’s refineries in the event of a temporary shutdown. Furthermore, we may pursue strategic asset acquisitions from third parties or organic growth projects to the extent such acquisitions or projects complement our or PBF Energy’s existing asset base or provide attractive potential returns. Identifying and executing acquisitions and organic growth projects is a key part of our strategy, and we believe that we are well-positioned to acquire logistics assets from PBF Energy and third parties should such opportunities arise. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to identify attractive organic growth projects or acquisitions in the future, or be able to consummate any such opportunities identified. Additionally, if we do not complete acquisitions or organic growth projects on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions or projects we do complete may reduce, rather than increase, our cash available for distribution. These acquisitions and organic growth projects could also affect the comparability of our results from period to period. We expect to fund future growth capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash-on-hand, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. To the extent we issue additional units to fund future acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payments of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level.
Third-Party Business. As of December 31, 2020, PBF Holding accounts for a substantial majority of our revenue, and we continue to expect that a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future will be derived from operations supporting PBF Holding’s refineries. We are examining further diversification of our customer base by potentially developing additional third-party throughput volumes in our existing system and continuing to explore expanding our asset portfolio to service third-party customers. Unless we are successful in attracting additional third-party customers, our ability to increase volumes will be dependent on PBF Holding, which has no obligation under our commercial agreements to supply our facilities with additional volumes in excess of its MVCs. If we are unable to increase throughput or storage volumes, future growth may be limited.

____________
(a)Represents 50% of depreciation and amortization for Torrance Valley Pipeline Company LLC (“TVPC”) for the five months ended May 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018. Subsequent to acquiring the remaining 50% equity interest in TVPC on May 31, 2019 (the “TVPC Acquisition”), we own 100% of the equity interest in TVPC and no longer record a noncontrolling interest.
Summary.
Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $39.3 million, or 36.3%, to $147.4 million from $108.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, details of which are shown in the following graph and further described below.
The increase in net income was primarily due to the following:
•an increase in total revenue of approximately $20.0 million, or 5.9%, primarily attributable to the recommencement of operations of certain assets at our East Coast storage facility, operations of recently constructed assets and inflation rate adjustments implemented in accordance with certain of our commercial agreements (the “Inflation Rate Increase”) in 2020, offset by lower revenue attributable to certain assets not subject to MVC shortfall payments due to a reduction in throughput volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower pass-through utilities fees;
•a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $18.8 million, or 15.8%, as a result of decreased discretionary spending, including maintenance and outside service costs, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower environmental clean-up remediation costs, lower utility expenses due to reduced energy usage and no remediation of product contamination costs in 2020 compared to costs incurred in 2019 for product contamination remediation at one of our terminals, offset by expenses related to the recommencement of operations of certain assets at our East Coast storage facility;
•a decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately $5.8 million, or 23.5%, as a result of decreased acquisition and transaction costs and unit-based compensation expense;
•a decrease in change in contingent consideration of approximately $13.6 million due to the termination of the CPI Processing Agreement in Q4 2020 and the resulting elimination of the projected earn-out liability for future periods, offset by an increase in estimated future payouts for the current annual period of the CPI Processing Agreement; and
•a decrease in other expenses of approximately $3.2 million, or 6.3%, related to:
◦a decrease in interest expense of approximately $2.2 million, or 4.7%, as a result of lower borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; and
◦a decrease in accretion on discounted liabilities of approximately $1.0 million, or 35.4%, due to lower outstanding liability;
offset by the following:
•an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $15.1 million, or 39.1%, resulting from the accelerated depreciation and amortization of certain CPI tangible and intangible assets, which were subject to the termination of the CPI Processing Agreement in Q4 2020, as well as the timing of acquisitions and new assets being placed in service; and
•an increase in impairment expense of $7.0 million resulting from an impairment charge to write-down the processing unit assets and customer contract intangible asset in connection with the termination of the CPI Processing Agreement.
EBITDA attributable to PBFX for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $45.2 million to $230.0 million from $184.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the factors noted above, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization, impairment expense, interest expense, net, amortization of loan fees and debt premium, accretion on discounted liabilities, change in contingent consideration, noncontrolling interest and earnings attributable to the CPI earn-out.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $36.0 million to $237.0 million from $201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the factors noted above, excluding the impact of acquisition and transaction costs, unit-based compensation, certain environmental remediation costs and certain tariff true-up adjustments.
Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $7.3 million, or 7.3%, to $108.2 million from $100.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, details of which are shown in the following graph and further described below.
The increase in net income was primarily due to the following:
•an increase in total revenue of approximately $56.8 million, or 20.0%, primarily attributable to operations of recently acquired or constructed assets, including the recommencement of certain of the idled assets acquired in the acquisition of the East Coast Storage Assets (the “East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition”), the 2019 Inflation Rate Increase and higher throughput at certain of our assets, offset by a decrease in revenue at the Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline due to a reduction in its pipeline tariff based on the lower than budget Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline project costs, which were finalized during the first quarter of 2019 (the “PNGPC Rate Adjustment”); and
•an increase in change in contingent consideration of approximately $0.8 million as a result of the change in estimated future payouts associated with the Contingent Consideration;
offset by the following:
•an increase in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $30.2 million, or 34.2%, as a result of expenses related to the operations of recently acquired assets, higher environmental clean-up remediation costs, increased maintenance activity, increased utility expenses coinciding with higher throughput at certain of our assets, increased regulatory costs and remediation of product contamination costs at one of our terminals;
•an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.1 million, or 14.7%, as a result of transaction costs related to the IDR Restructuring, higher unit-based compensation expense and higher annual expense associated with the Omnibus Agreement, offset by lower acquisition related costs;
•an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $8.8 million, or 29.5%, related to the timing of acquisitions and new assets being placed in service; and
•an increase in other expense of approximately $8.1 million, or 18.8%, related to:
◦an increase in interest expense, net of approximately $6.0 million, or 14.8%, attributable to higher borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility;
◦an increase in amortization of loan fees and debt premium of approximately $0.1 million, or 3.7%; and
◦an increase in accretion on discounted liabilities of approximately $2.0 million, or 257.2%, attributable to a full year of accretion on the discounted liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of the East Coast Storage Assets.
EBITDA attributable to PBFX for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $32.4 million to $184.8 million from $152.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the factors noted above, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, amortization of loan fees and debt premium, accretion on discounted liabilities, change in contingent consideration, noncontrolling interest and earnings attributable to the CPI earn-out.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $39.9 million to $201.0 million from $161.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the factors noted above, excluding the impact of acquisition and transaction costs, unit-based compensation, certain environmental remediation costs and the PNGPC Rate Adjustment.
Segment Information
Our operations are comprised of operating segments, which are strategic business units that offer different services in various geographical locations. We review operations in two reportable segments: (i) Transportation and Terminaling and (ii) Storage. Decisions concerning the allocation of resources and assessment of operating performance are made based on this segmentation. Management measures the operating performance of each of our reportable segments based on the segment operating income. Segment operating income is defined as net revenue less operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment expense and change in contingent consideration. General and administrative expenses and interest expenses not included in the Transportation and Terminaling and Storage segments are included in Corporate. Segment reporting is further discussed in Note 14 “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Transportation and Terminaling Segment
The following table and discussion provide an explanation of our results of operations of the Transportation and Terminaling segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Our Transportation and Terminaling operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $6.2 million, or 3.8%, to $169.3 million from $163.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, details of which are shown in the following graph and further described below.
The increase in operating income was primarily due to the following:
•a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $18.4 million, or 20.1%, as a result of decreased discretionary spending, including maintenance and outside service costs, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower environmental clean-up remediation costs and lower utility expenses due to reduced energy usage and no remediation of product contamination costs in 2020 compared to costs incurred in 2019 for product contamination remediation at one of our terminals;
offset by the following:
•a decrease in revenue of approximately $11.7 million, or 4.1%, primarily attributable to a reduction in throughput volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower pass-through utilities fees, offset by the 2020 Inflation Rate Increase; and
•an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $0.5 million, or 1.7%, related to the timing of acquisitions and new assets being placed in service.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Our Transportation and Terminaling operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $13.7 million, or 9.2%, to $163.0 million from $149.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, details of which are shown in the following graph and further described below.
The increase in operating income was primarily due to the following:
•an increase in revenue of approximately $32.3 million, or 12.9%, primarily attributable to operations of recently acquired or constructed assets, higher throughput at certain of our assets and the 2019 Inflation Rate Increase, offset by a decrease in revenue at the Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline due to the PNGPC Rate Adjustment;
offset by the following:
•an increase in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $15.7 million, or 20.6%, due to expenses related to the operations of recently acquired assets, higher environmental clean-up remediation costs, increased maintenance activity, increased utility expenses coinciding with higher throughput at certain of our assets, remediation of product contamination costs at one of our terminals and increased regulatory costs; and
•an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $2.9 million, or 11.8%, related to the timing of acquisitions and new assets being placed in service.

Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Our Storage operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $24.1 million, or 116.0%, to $44.8 million from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, details of which are shown in the following graph and further described below.
The increase in operating income was primarily due to the following:
•an increase in revenue of approximately $31.8 million, or 55.3%, primarily attributable to the recommencement of operations of certain assets at our East Coast storage facility and the 2020 Inflation Rate Increase;
•an increase in change in contingent consideration of approximately $13.6 million due to the termination of the CPI Processing Agreement in Q4 2020 and the resulting elimination of the projected earn-out liability for future periods, offset by the increase in estimated future payouts for the current annual period of the CPI Processing Agreement; and
•a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $0.3 million, or 1.2%, as a result of decreased spending at our facilities due to cost cutting measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including lower maintenance activity, offset by the recommencement of operations of certain assets at our East Coast storage facility;
offset by the following:
•an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $14.6 million, or 135.7%, resulting from the accelerated depreciation and amortization of certain CPI tangible and intangible assets, which were subject to the termination of the CPI Processing Agreement in Q4 2020, as well as the timing of acquisitions and new assets being placed in service; and
•an increase in impairment expense of $7.0 million resulting from an impairment charge to write-down the processing unit assets and customer contract intangible asset in connection with the termination of the CPI Processing Agreement.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Our Storage operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $4.8 million, or 30.5%, to $20.8 million from $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, details of which are shown in the following graph and further described below.
The increase in operating income was primarily due to the following:
•an increase in revenue of approximately $24.4 million, or 74.0%, primarily attributable to the East Coast Storage Assets operations, including the recommencement of certain of the idled assets acquired in the East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition, and the 2019 Inflation Rate Increase; and
•an increase in change in contingent consideration of approximately $0.8 million, as a result of the change in estimated future payouts associated with the Contingent Consideration;
offset by the following:
•an increase in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $14.5 million, or 118.9%, due to expenses associated with the East Coast Storage Assets, as well as increased regulatory costs; and
•an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $5.9 million, or 119.5%, related to the timing of acquisitions and new assets being placed in service.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the current challenging and volatile market conditions, our business and operating results have been impacted by demand destruction for refined petroleum products as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown and governmental and consumer responses, including travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders. Such conditions continue to affect our operations and financial condition due to changes in the usage and level of demand for our services, including a reduction in third-party and incremental affiliate revenue. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations (a significant portion of which are supported by MVCs in our commercial agreements), borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of additional debt and equity securities as appropriate given market conditions. Additionally, we remain focused on opportunities to support our financial position in the current environment, including limiting capital expenditures, reducing discretionary activities and third-party services and continually assessing our quarterly distribution level. While it is impossible to estimate the duration or complete financial
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and volatile market conditions, we expect that these sources of funds will be adequate to provide for our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, including our debt service, capital expenditures and distributions on our units. We may also pursue other strategic initiatives to strengthen our financial position, including debt and/or equity securities repurchases, to the extent such initiatives can be funded without impairing our liquidity. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for further information.
Our largest customer is our affiliate, PBF Holding, a subsidiary of our parent sponsor. PBF Energy has initiated several steps as part of a strategic plan to navigate current volatile markets and preserve or enhance its liquidity, including asset sales, new debt issuances, temporarily idling various units at certain refineries to optimize production, reductions in capital and operating expenditures, suspension of its dividend and exploring other potential opportunistic financing activities. We believe such actions will allow PBF Energy to continue to honor its commercial agreements with us.
In response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our quarterly distribution to our minimum quarterly distribution of $0.30 per unit effective with the distribution for the first quarter of 2020. This reduction represents a strategic shift to build our cash flow coverage, de-lever our business and increase our financial resources as we continue to pursue potential organic growth projects or strategic acquisition opportunities. However, we intend to continue to pay at least the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.30 per unit per quarter, or $1.20 per unit on an annualized basis, which aggregates to approximately $18.9 million per quarter and approximately $75.6 million on an annualized basis based on the number of common units outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $331.4 million of liquidity, including approximately $36.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, and access to approximately $295.1 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The tables below summarize our 2020 and 2019 quarterly distributions related to our quarterly financial results:
____________
(a)Cash distributions are paid in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the distributions are earned. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the total cash distribution was estimated based on vested shares anticipated to be outstanding as of the record date. We do not expect the actual distribution to be materially different.
Credit Facilities
Revolving Credit Facility
The maximum amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility was increased to $500.0 million in July 2018. We have the ability to further increase the maximum amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional $250.0 million, to a total facility size of $750.0 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from its lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions. Refer to Note 8 “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as information pertaining to corresponding financial and other covenants. We are in compliance with the financial and other covenants as of December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made net repayments of $83.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Senior Notes
During 2015 and 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, PBF Finance, issued a combined $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our subsidiaries. In addition, PBF LLC provides a limited guarantee of collection of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, but is not otherwise subject to the covenants of the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. We have the option to repurchase all or a portion of the 2023 Notes at varying prices no less than 100% of the principal amounts of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 2023 Notes have the option to require that we repurchase the principal amounts of the 2023 Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption only upon a change in control, certain asset sale transactions, or in the event of a default as defined in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. In addition, the 2023 Notes contain covenants limiting our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make certain types of investments, incur additional debt, issue preferred equity, create liens, make certain payments, sell assets, merge or consolidate with other entities, and enter into transactions with affiliates. We are in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2020.
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $37.6 million to $186.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was the result of an increase in net income of approximately $39.3 million and a net increase in non-cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization, impairment expense, amortization of loan fees and debt premium, accretion on discounted liabilities, unit-based compensation and change in contingent consideration of approximately $5.7 million, offset by a decrease in the
net changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $7.3 million primarily driven by the timing of collection of accounts receivables and liability payments.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $15.9 million to $149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $133.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was the result of a net increase in non-cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization, amortization of loan fees and debt premium, accretion on discounted liabilities, unit-based compensation and change in contingent consideration of approximately $11.1 million and an increase in net income of approximately $7.3 million, offset by a decrease in the net changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $2.5 million primarily driven by the timing of collection of accounts receivables and liability payments.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $19.4 million to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due to a decrease in capital expenditures of approximately $19.4 million primarily related to a reduction in capital spending in the current year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher capital spend on organic growth projects in 2019 compared to 2020.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $144.0 million to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $175.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due to the acquisitions of the East Coast Storage Assets for $75.0 million and the Knoxville Terminals for $58.4 million, both of which occurred in 2018, and a decrease in capital expenditures of approximately $10.6 million primarily related to higher capital spend on organic growth projects in 2018 compared to 2019.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $70.8 million to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $102.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of distributions to unitholders of $88.4 million, net repayments of $83.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and deferred financing costs and other of $1.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the acquisition of the TVPC noncontrolling interest for $200.0 million, distributions to unitholders of $123.9 million, the deferred payment for the East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition of $32.0 million and distributions to TVPC members of $8.5 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of common units of $132.5 million, net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $127.0 million and deferred financing costs and other of $2.7 million.
Net cash used in financing activities changed by approximately $145.0 million to $102.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the acquisition of the TVPC noncontrolling interest for $200.0 million, distributions to unitholders of $123.9 million, the deferred payment for the East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition of $32.0 million and distributions to TVPC members of $8.5 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of common units of $132.5 million, net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $127.0 million and deferred financing costs and other of $2.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $126.3 million, proceeds from issuance of common units of $34.8 million and a contribution from PBF LLC of $4.2 million related to the 2018 pre-acquisition activities of the Development Assets, offset by distributions to unitholders of $98.8 million, distributions to TVPC members of $20.3 million and deferred financing costs and other of $3.5 million.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital requirements have consisted of, and are expected to continue to consist of: expansion, maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures. Expansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. Examples of expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of assets, the construction, development or acquisition of equipment at our facilities or projects that provide additional throughput or storage capacity to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to expand our operating capacity or increase our operating income. Maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets, and for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures for the refurbishment and replacement of our transportation, terminaling, storage and processing assets and to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety. Regulatory capital expenditures are expenditures made to attain or maintain compliance with regulatory standards. Examples of regulatory capital expenditures are expenditures incurred to address environmental laws or regulations.
Capital expenditures for the periods presented were as follows:
____________
(*)Expansion capital expenditures include our acquisitions for the periods presented.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our capital expenditures were primarily incurred for maintenance of the East Coast Terminals, the Toledo Storage Facility and the Torrance Valley Pipeline, as well as growth projects associated with the East Coast Storage Assets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our capital expenditures were primarily incurred for growth projects associated with the East Coast Storage Assets and the Development Assets and maintenance of the Toledo Storage Facility, the East Coast Terminals and the Torrance Valley Pipeline. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our capital expenditures were primarily incurred for the acquisition of the East Coast Storage Assets and the Knoxville Terminals, organic growth projects associated with the Development Assets and maintenance of the Toledo Storage Facility, the East Coast Terminals and the Torrance Valley Pipeline.
We currently expect to spend an aggregate of between approximately $10.0 million and $20.0 million during 2021 for capital expenditures, of which between approximately $10.0 million and $14.0 million relate to maintenance capital expenditures. We anticipate the forecasted maintenance capital expenditures will be funded primarily with cash from operations and through borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as needed. We currently have not included any potential future acquisitions in our budgeted capital expenditures for the twelve months ending December 31, 2021. We may rely on external sources including other borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and issuances of equity and debt securities to fund any significant future expansion.
Contractual Obligations
Information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 is set forth in the following table:
____________________
(1)No principal amounts are due under the 2023 Notes and Revolving Credit Facility until May 2023 and July 2023, respectively.
(2)Includes interest on the 2023 Notes and Revolving Credit Facility based on outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2020. Includes commitment fees on the Revolving Credit Facility through July 2023 using rates in effect at December 31, 2020.
(3)Includes annual fixed payments under the Omnibus Agreement and the Services Agreement, as well as estimated obligations under the Omnibus Agreement to reimburse PBF LLC for certain compensation and benefit costs of employees who devote more than 50% of their time to us. Obligations under these agreements are expected to continue through the terms of our existing commercial agreements.
(4)Includes environmental liabilities associated with the East Coast Terminals, the Torrance Valley Pipeline and the East Coast Storage Assets. In accordance with the Contribution Agreement for TVPC, PBF Holding has indemnified us for any and all costs associated with environmental remediation for obligations that existed on or before August 31, 2016, including all known or unknown events.
(5)Includes the estimated Contingent Consideration amount payable to Crown Point International, LLC related to the acquisition of the East Coast Storage Assets and related earn-out payments.
(6)Includes operating leases and rental and franchise payments to secure right of way access across certain East Coast Terminals and Torrance Valley Pipeline assets with various terms and tenures.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation in the U.S. has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, except as noted above for the Inflation Rate Increases.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities, other than outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $4.9 million.
Environmental and Other Matters
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. As with the industry generally, compliance
with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to develop, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures and net income, we believe they do not necessarily affect our competitive position, as the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation of such laws and regulations, are subject to changes by regulatory authorities, and continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, violation of environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the development of additional facilities or equipment. Furthermore, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury or property damage or by the U.S. federal government or state governments for natural resources damages. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business and have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts.
Environmental Liabilities
Contaminations resulting from spills of crude oil or petroleum products are not unusual within the petroleum terminaling or transportation industries, and, historically, spills at truck and rail racks and terminals have resulted in contamination of the environment, including soils and groundwater.
Pursuant to the Contribution Agreements entered into in connection with the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF, PBF Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain known and unknown environmental liabilities that are based on conditions in existence at our Predecessor’s properties and associated with the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets and arising from the conditions that existed prior to the closings of the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify PBF Energy for (i) certain events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of our assets that occur, as applicable, after the closing of each Acquisition from PBF (including the IPO) and (ii) environmental liabilities related to our assets if the environmental liability is the result of the negligence, willful misconduct or criminal conduct of us or our employees, including those seconded to us. As a result, we may incur environmental expenses in the future, which may be substantial.
As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a total liability related to environmental remediation costs of $1.8 million related to existing environmental liabilities. Refer to Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 “Summary of Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, and, in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader’s understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring, at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some of which we may have little or no control over. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and
judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes.
Business Combinations
We use the acquisition method of accounting for third-party acquisitions for the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, we obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While our management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
Certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. As of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. Any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration, subsequent to the measurement period, will be recognized as earnings in the period in which it occurs. Such contingent consideration liabilities are based on best estimates of future expected payment obligations, which are subject to change due to many factors outside of our control. Changes to the estimate of expected future payments may occur, from time to time, due to various reasons, including actual results differing from estimates and adjustments to the revenue or earnings assumptions used as the basis for the liability based on historical experience. While we believe that our current estimate of the fair value of our contingent consideration liability is reasonable, it is possible that the actual future settlement of our earn-out obligation could materially differ.
The Acquisitions from PBF were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, we record the net assets that were acquired from PBF Energy on its consolidated balance sheets at PBF Energy’s historical carrying value rather than fair value.
Environmental Matters
Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable future costs using currently available technology and the impact that current regulations may have on our remediation plans. The actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could materially differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination, changes in environmental laws and regulations, potential improvements in remediation technologies and the participation of other responsible parties.
