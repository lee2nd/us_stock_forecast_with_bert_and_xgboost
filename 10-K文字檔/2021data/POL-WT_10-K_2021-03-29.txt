ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections Item 1A “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
All periods presented on or prior to April 5, 2019 represent the operations of Goedeker Television, our predecessor. Unless otherwise specified, all results of operations information for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the full year.
References to “Successor” refer to the financial position and results of operations of our company subsequent to April 5, 2019. References to “Predecessor” refer to the financial position and results of operations of Goedeker Television on and before April 5, 2019.
Overview
Our company is a one-stop e-commerce destination for home furnishings, including appliances, furniture, home goods and related products. Since our founding in 1951, we have evolved from a local brick and mortar operation serving the St. Louis metro area to a large nationwide omnichannel retailer that offers one-stop shopping for the leading brands. While we still maintain our St. Louis showroom, over 95% of our sales are placed through our website at www.goedekers.com. We offer over 141,000 SKUs organized by category and product features, providing visitors to the site an easy to navigate shopping experience.
Through our e-commerce business model, we offer an online marketplace for consumers looking for variety, style, service and value when shopping for nearly any home product needed. We are focused on bringing our customers an experience that is at the forefront of shopping online for the home. We have built a large online selection of appliances, furniture, home goods and related products. We are able to offer this vast selection of products because our model requires minimal inventory in relation to our sales. We specialize in the home category and this has enabled us to build a shopping experience and logistics infrastructure that is tailored to the unique characteristics of our market.
Recent Developments
Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic
In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The virus has since spread to over 150 countries and every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency.
Most states and cities, including in markets in which we operate, reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, “stay at home” rules, social distancing measures and restrictions on the types of businesses that could continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it. Pursuant to restrictions in Missouri, our showroom was closed from April through June of 2020, but our call center and warehouse continued to operate. Since over 95% of our sales are completed online and our call center and warehouse and distribution operations continued to operate, the restrictions put in place have not had a materially negative impact on our operations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are dependent upon suppliers to provide us with all of the products that we sell. The pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact suppliers and manufacturers of certain of our products. As a result, we have faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.
In addition, the global deterioration in economic conditions, which may have an adverse impact on discretionary consumer spending, could also impact our business. For instance, consumer spending may be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, including a rise in unemployment, and decreased consumer confidence resulting from the pandemic. Changing consumer behaviors as a result of the pandemic may also have a material impact on our revenue.
Furthermore, the spread of COVID-19 has adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result, in a significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital in the future, which could negatively affect our liquidity.
We have taken steps to take care of our employees, including providing the ability for employees to work remotely and implementing strategies to support appropriate social distancing techniques for those employees who are not able to work remotely. We have also taken precautions with regard to employee, facility and office hygiene as well as implementing significant travel restrictions. We are also assessing our business continuity plans for all business units in the context of the pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation, and we will continue to monitor and mitigate developments affecting our workforce, our suppliers, our customers, and the public at large to the extent we are able to do so. We have and will continue to carefully review all rules, regulations, and orders and responding accordingly.
If the current pace of the pandemic cannot be slowed and the spread of COVID-19 is not contained, our business operations could be further delayed or interrupted. We expect that government and health authorities may announce new or extend existing restrictions, which could require us to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions. We may also experience limitations in employee resources. In addition, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees were suspected of having COVID-19, which could require quarantine of some or all such employees or closure of our facilities for disinfection. The duration of any business disruption cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our ability to operate our business and result in additional costs.
The extent to which the pandemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date of this report, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and steps taken to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others. Nevertheless, the pandemic and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in the global supply chain and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also Item 1A “Risk Factors” for more information.
Lease Agreement
On January 13, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Westgate 200, LLC, pursuant to which we lease approximately 58,000 square feet in a building located in St. Charles, Missouri, and which we expect to occupy on or around April 15, 2021. The lease, which commenced on January 13, 2021, is for a term of 63 months and provides for a base rent of $4.35 per square foot per year with 2.5% annual increases and a three-month abatement, resulting in a base rent during the first year of $20,977 per month, increasing to a base rent during the fifth year of $23,147 per month. We will also pay our 29% pro rata portion of the property taxes, operating expenses and insurance costs and are also responsible to pay for the utilities used on the premises. Pursuant to the lease, the landlord will provide us with an improvement allowance of $150,000 towards the expenses incurred by us connection with the installation of approved office and bathroom improvements, together with the main electrical services for the premises, and we are responsible for any additional work necessary to ready the premises for our occupancy, such as installing furnishings, trade fixtures and equipment. We have two (2) options to renew the lease, each for an additional five (5) year period.
Securities Purchase Agreement
On March 19, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with two institutional investors, pursuant to which we issued to each investor (i) a 10% OID senior secured promissory note in the principal amount of $2,750,000 and (ii) a four-year warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $12.00, subject to adjustments, which may be exercised on a cashless basis, for a purchase price of $2,500,000 each, or $5,000,000 in the aggregate. After deducting a placement fee and other expenses, we received net proceeds of $4,590,000.
The notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum and mature on December 19, 2021. We may prepare the notes in whole or in part at any time or from time to time without penalty or premium upon at least five (5) days prior written notice, which notice period may be waived by the holder. In addition, if we issue and sell shares of our equity securities to investors on or before the maturity date in an equity financing with total gross proceeds of not less than $10,000,000 (excluding the conversion of the notes or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes), then we must repay the then-outstanding principal amount of the notes and any accrued but unpaid interest.
The notes are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets and contain customary events of default. Upon, and during the continuance of, an event of default, the notes are convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $12.00, or if lower, 80% of the lowest volume weighted average price for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days prior to the applicable conversion date, but in no event less than $9.00. The conversion price will be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the common stock. In addition, if we sell or grant any common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or grant any right to reprice such securities at an effective price per share that is lower than the then conversion price, the conversion price shall be reduced to such price, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall not effect any conversion of a note, and a holder shall not have the right to convert any principal and/or interest of a note, to the extent that after giving effect to the conversion the holder (together with the holder’s affiliates and any persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own over 4.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the note. The holder may, upon not less than 61 days’ prior notice to us, increase or decrease such limitation, provided that such limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the note. The warrants also contain this beneficial ownership limitation.
The securities purchase agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the investors were granted piggy-back registration rights with respect to the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants. We also agreed that, until the date that no investor own any securities, we will timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by us pursuant to the Exchange Act even if we are not then subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. In addition, we agreed that, so long as any of the notes remain outstanding, neither our company, nor any subsidiary of our company, shall, without each investor’s written consent and subject to certain exceptions set forth in the securities purchase agreement:
● sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any significant portion of its assets outside the ordinary course of business;
● incur, create, assume or suffer to exist any lien on any of its property or assets, except for certain liens set forth in the Purchase Agreement;
● incur or suffer to exist or guarantee any indebtedness that is senior to or pari passu with (in priority of payment and performance) our obligations under the securities purchase agreement except for non-equity linked indebtedness relating to the acquisition of inventory secured by certain liens;
● pay, declare or set apart for such payment, any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, property or other securities) on shares of capital stock, other than dividends on shares of common stock solely in the form of additional shares of common stock, or directly or indirectly or through any subsidiary make any other payment or distribution in respect of its capital stock;
● redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire in any one transaction or series of related transactions any shares of our capital stock or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire any such shares, or repay any pari passu or subordinated indebtedness other than non-equity linked indebtedness relating to the acquisition of inventory secured by certain liens;
● lend money, give credit, make advances to or enter into any transaction with any person, firm, joint venture or corporation, including, without limitation, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates of our company, except loans, credits or advances (i) in existence or committed on the closing date and which we have informed each investor in writing prior to the closing date, (ii) in regard to transactions with unaffiliated third parties, made in the ordinary course of business, or (iii) in regard to transactions with unaffiliated third parties, not in excess of $50,000; or
● repay any affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of our company in connection with any indebtedness or accrued amounts owed to any such party.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance
Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:
● our ability to acquire new customers or retain existing customers;
● our ability to offer competitive product pricing;
● our ability to broaden product offerings;
● industry demand and competition; and
● market conditions and our market position.
Key Financial Operating Metrics
A site session occurs when a person visits our website. An order occurs when a customer has visited our website and ordered one or more items and has paid for them. An order is paid for by our customer when the order is placed and booked as revenue by us when the order is shipped..
Total revenues and total orders for any given month may not be equal for two primary reasons: (1) normal customer cancellations and (2) the time required to ship an order and recognize revenue. When there are no supply chain issues, the time from order to shipping is between 20 and 25 days. Thus, an order made after the 10th of the current month will become revenue in the succeeding month, distorting the comparison between a months’ orders and its sales. In 2020, supply chain issues increased the time up to 44 days from order to delivery.
Our site sessions increased to approximately 9.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately 6.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. These increased site sessions resulted in three-year highs for orders in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:
● have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
● comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
● submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and
● disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Successor), for the period from April 6 to December 31, 2019 (Successor), and for the period from January 1 to April 5, 2019 (Predecessor), in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue.
We believe that reviewing our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 by combining the results of the 2019 successor period (April 6, 2019 through December 31, 2019) and 2019 predecessor period (January 1, 2019 through April 5, 2019) with the pro forma adjustment related to the acquisition described below, is more useful in discussing our overall operating performance compared to the results of the year ended December 31, 2020 (successor). We do not see any potential risks associated with utilizing this pro forma presentation.
Following are the combined periods for 2020 and 2019:
*Includes a pro forma adjustment of $66,260 for the management fee to our manager.
Product sales, net. We generate revenue from the retail sale of home furnishings, including appliances, furniture, home goods and related products. Our product sales increased by $7,518,640, or 15.79%, to $55,133,653 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $47,615,013 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $12,946,901 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019 and $34,668,112 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019.
The increase is due to increased sales volume to meet appliance and furniture demand resulting from increased advertising, which has a direct impact on customer orders and shipped sales. In the first three months, sales were affected by working capital issues, which delayed the timing of ordering product to fulfill customer orders resulting in increased order cancellations. Late in the second quarter and through the remainder of 2020, we experienced delays in getting products from manufacturers whose production facilities were closed or operating at reduced capacity because of the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in some cancellations of customer orders. We estimate that cancellations caused by shipping delays approximated $39.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, based on the historical ratio of shipped sales to customer orders of approximately 79% to the actual ratio of approximately 45% in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our net sales by sales type is as follows:
The percentage of furniture sales increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 as furniture was more readily available from manufacturers than appliances.
Cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold consists of the cost of purchased merchandise plus the cost of delivering merchandise and, where applicable, installation, net of promotional rebates and other incentives received from vendors. Our cost of goods sold increased by $8,277,570, or 20.90%, to $47,878,541 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $39,600,971 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $11,004,842 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019 and $28,596,129 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased from 83.17% in 2019 to 86.84% in 2020. Such increase was due to coronavirus related supply chain issues reducing the volume we purchased, which resulted in decreased manufacturer rebates, as well as due to the change in product mix, with furniture sales, which have lower margins, accounting for a larger portion of our total sales in 2020.
Personnel expenses. Personnel expenses include employee salaries and bonuses plus related payroll taxes. It also includes health insurance premiums, 401(k) contributions, training costs and stock compensation expense. Our personnel expenses increased by $2,741,710, or 71.70%, to $6,565,380 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3,823,670 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $913,919 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019 and $2,909,751 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019. As a percentage of net sales, personnel expenses increased from 8.03% in 2019 to 11.91% in 2020. The increase is the result of hiring additional senior management and other staff needed for increased customer demand for our products, the accrual of $359,216 as the present value of a severance contract payable to our former president and $398,908 in stock compensation expense. Beginning in the second quarter, there was a dramatic increase in cancellations of customer orders, which were primarily related to the lack of product availability. We hired a number of temporary employees to process cancellations and address the related customer service issues. As a percentage of orders, our personnel expense declined to 5.8% in 2020 from 6.2% in 2019.
Advertising expenses. Advertising expenses include the cost of marketing our products and primarily include online search engine expenses. Our advertising expenses increased by $2,154,578, or 79.48%, to $4,865,361 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2,710,783 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $714,276 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019 and $1,996,507 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019. As a percentage of net sales, advertising expenses increased from 5.69% in 2019 to 8.82% in 2020. The increase relates to an increase in advertising spending to drive traffic to our website. Measuring our advertising expense as a percentage of orders, we had a decline in 2020 of 3.9% compared to 4.4% in 2019.
Bank and credit card fees. Bank and credit card fees are primarily the fees we pay credit card processors for processing credit card payments made by customers. Our bank and credit card fees increased by $606,496, or 50.54%, to $1,806,620 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,200,124 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $329,247 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019 and $870,877 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019. As a percentage of net sales, bank and credit card fees increased from 2.52% in 2019 to 3.28% in 2020. These fees are based on customer orders that are paid with a credit card (substantially all orders), so the increase was largely due to the increase in customer orders. We pay a credit card fee for each order, regardless of whether that order is shipped or cancelled by customer. Comparing bank and credit card fees as a percentage orders shows a reduction from 1.9% of orders in 2019 to 1.5% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $549,712, or 1.00% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $280,711, or 0.59% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional advisor fees, bad debts, rent expense, insurance, unremitted sales tax, and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our general and administrative expenses increased by $2,654,521, or 50.60%, to $7,900,566 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5,246,045 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $451,214 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019, $4,728,571 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and a pro forma adjustment of $66,260 for the management fee to our manager. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased from 11.02% in 2019 to 14.33% in 2020. The increase was largely due to increased directors and officers insurance expenses, fees to our board of directors, and legal, audit and other professional fees in connection with becoming a public company, as well as consulting fees to upgrade our online shopping cart, fees to our manager under the offsetting management services agreement described below, fees for our Electronic Data Interchange initiative, and other consulting fees. Comparing general and administrative expenses as a percentage orders shows a reduction from 8.4% of orders in 2019 to 6.4% in 2020.
Total other income (expense). We had $6,437,007 in total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to total other expense, net, of $1,120,408 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included income of $31,007 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019 and expenses of $1,151,415 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of financing costs of $762,911, interest expense of $870,847, adjustment in value of contingency of $138,922, loss on debt modification and extinguishment of $1,756,095, write-off of acquisition receivable of $809,000, and change in the warrant liability of $2,127,656, offset by interest income of $2,479 and other income of $25,945, while total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of financing costs of $520,160 and interest expense of $785,411, offset by a gain on write-down of contingency of $32,246, a change in fair value of warrant liability of $106,900, interest income of $23,807 and other income of $22,210.
Income tax benefit (expense). We had an income tax expense of $698,303 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an income tax benefit of $698,303 for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that we should establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset, resulting in an income tax expense of $698,303.
Net loss. As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net loss increased by $15,898,441, or 280.43%, to $21,567,837 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5,669,396 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $445,265 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019 and $5,856,174 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and a pro forma adjustment of $66,260 for the management fee to our manager. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was affected by certain non-cash charges described below equal to $4,831,673 in the aggregate.
Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation
This report contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures are net loss before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 excluding the following non-cash charges (i) an adjustment in value of contingency of $138,922, (ii) a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,756,095, (iii) a write-off of acquisition receivable of $809,000 and (iv) a non-cash charge to change in warrant liability expense of $2,127,656.
The non-GAAP financial information should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management, however, believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP, may provide a more complete understanding of our results and may facilitate a fuller analysis of our results, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Management has chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts, and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of results and to illustrate the results giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliation described in the next paragraph. Furthermore, the economic substance behind our decision to use such non-GAAP measures is that such measures approximate our controllable operating performance more closely than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures disclosed above to the comparable GAAP measure.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $934,729 and restricted cash of $8,977,187. We have generated significant losses since our acquisition of Goedeker Television and have relied on cash on hand, external bank lines of credit, proceeds from our initial public offering described below, issuance of third party and related party debt and the issuance of a note to support cashflow from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred operating losses of approximately $14.4 million, cash flows from operations of $5.4 million, and negative working capital of $17.5 million.
On August 4, 2020, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock, pursuant to which we sold 1,111,200 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $9.00 per share, for total gross proceeds of $10,000,800. After deducting the underwriting commission and offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $8,602,166. We used a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering to pay off certain debt.
As noted above, we received net proceeds of $4,590,000 from the sale of notes and warrants on March 19, 2021. These proceeds will supplement our cash flow from operations and provide additional liquidity.
Management has prepared estimates of operations for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 and believes that sufficient funds will be generated from operations to fund our operations and to service our debt obligations for one year from the date of the filing of this annual report. We may, however, in the future require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions, implementation of our strategy to expand our business, or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects
The impact of COVID-19 on our business has been considered in these assumptions; however, it is too early to know the full impact of COVID-19 or its timing on a return to more normal operations.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which we are expected to be able to realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business.
Summary of Cash Flow
The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all consolidated financial statement periods presented in this report.
Our net cash provided by operating activities was $5,408,883 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $1,687,947 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included net cash used in operating activities of $2,299,215 for our successor from April 6, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and net cash provided by operating activities of $611,268 for our predecessor from January 1, 2019 to April 5, 2019.

Initial Public Offering
On August 4, 2020, we sold 1,111,200 shares of common stock in connection with our initial public offering to the underwriters at a purchase price per share of $8.325 (the offering price to the public of $9.00 per share minus the underwriters’ discount) for total gross proceeds of $10,000,800. After deducting the underwriting commission and expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $8,602,166. We also issued warrants for the purchase of 55,560 shares of common stock to affiliates of the representative of the underwriters. The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, beginning on January 26, 2021 until July 30, 2025, at a per share exercise price equal to $11.25 (125% of the public offering price per share).
Term Loan
On August 25, 2020, we entered into a promissory note and security agreement with Arvest Bank for a loan in the principal amount of $3,500,000. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of this loan is $3,185,369, comprised of principal of $3,283,628, net of unamortized loan costs of $98,259.
The loan matures on August 25, 2025 and bears interest at 3.250% per annum; provided that, upon an event of default, the interest rate shall increase by 6% until paid in full. Pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, we are required to make monthly payments of $63,353 beginning on September 25, 2020 and until the maturity date, at which time all unpaid principal and interest will be due. We may prepay the loan in full or in part at any time without penalty. The loan agreement contains customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants for a loan of this type. The loan is secured by all financial assets credited to our securities account held by Arvest Investments, Inc.
Contractual Obligations
Our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under the term loan described above, the operating leases described under Item 2 “Properties” and other contractual commitments described below.
Management Services Agreement
On April 5, 2019, we entered into a management services agreement with our manager, pursuant to which we appointed our manager to provide certain services to us for a quarterly management fee equal to $62,500. Under certain circumstances specified in the management services agreement, our quarterly fee may be reduced if similar fees payable to our manager by subsidiaries of our former parent company, 1847 Holdings LLC, or 1847 Holdings, exceed a threshold amount.
Pursuant to the management services agreement, we must also reimburse our manager for all costs and expenses which are specifically approved by our board of directors, including all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, that are actually incurred by our or its affiliates on our behalf in connection with performing services under the management services agreement.
The services provided by our manager include: conducting general and administrative supervision and oversight of our day-to-day business and operations, including, but not limited to, recruiting and hiring of personnel, administration of personnel and personnel benefits, development of administrative policies and procedures, establishment and management of banking services, managing and arranging for the maintaining of liability insurance, arranging for equipment rental, maintenance of all necessary permits and licenses, acquisition of any additional licenses and permits that become necessary, participation in risk management policies and procedures; and overseeing and consulting with respect to our business and operational strategies, the implementation of such strategies and the evaluation of such strategies, including, but not limited to, strategies with respect to capital expenditure and expansion programs, acquisitions or dispositions and product or service lines.
We expensed $250,000 and $183,790 in management fees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Earn Out Payments
Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with Goedeker Television, it is entitled to receive the following earn out payments to the extent that our business achieves the applicable EBITDA (as defined in the asset purchase agreement) targets:
1. An earn out payment of $200,000 if the EBITDA of our business for the trailing twelve (12) month period from the closing date is $2,500,000 or greater, which target was not met;
2. An earn out payment of $200,000 if the EBITDA of our business for the trailing twelve (12) month period from the first anniversary of closing date is $2,500,000 or greater, which target we do not expect to meet; and
3. An earn out payment of $200,000 if the EBITDA of our business for the trailing twelve (12) month period from the second anniversary of the closing date is $2,500,000 or greater. We expect to meet this target and adjusted the contingent note payable in the consolidated balance sheet to the present value of the amount due.
To the extent the EBITDA of our business for any applicable period is less than $2,500,000 but greater than $1,500,000, we must pay a partial earn out payment to Goedeker Television in an amount equal to the product determined by multiplying (i) the EBITDA Achievement Percentage by (ii) the applicable earn out payment for such period, where the “Achievement Percentage” is the percentage determined by dividing (A) the amount of (i) the EBITDA of our business for the applicable period less (ii) $1,500,000, by (B) $1,000,000. For avoidance of doubt, no partial earn out payments shall be earned or paid to the extent the EBITDA of our business for any applicable period is equal or less than $1,500,000.
To the extent Goedeker Television is entitled to all or a portion of an earn out payment, the applicable earn out payment(s) (or portion thereof) shall be paid on the date that is three (3) years from the closing date, and shall accrue interest from the date on which it is determined Goedeker Television is entitled to such earn out payment (or portion thereof) at a rate equal to five percent (5%) per annum, computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our company. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition and Cost of Revenue
We record revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606. Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer purchase orders, including significant judgments.
We collect the full sales price from the customer at the time the order is placed, which is recorded as customer deposits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. We do not incur incremental costs obtaining purchase orders from customers, however, if we did, because all our contracts are less than a year in duration, any contract costs incurred would be expensed rather than capitalized.
The revenue that we recognize arises from orders we receive from our customers. Our performance obligations under the customer orders correspond to each sale of merchandise that we make to customers under the purchase orders; as a result, each purchase order generally contains only one performance obligation based on the merchandise sale to be completed.
Control of the delivery transfers to customers when the customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the benefits from, our products, which generally occurs when the customer assumes the risk of loss. The risk of loss shifts to the customer at different times depending on the method of delivery. We deliver products to our customers in three possible ways. The first way is through a shipment of the products through a third-party carrier from our warehouse to the customer (which we refer to as a company shipment). The second way is through a shipment of the products through a third-party carrier from a warehouse other than our warehouse to the customer (which we refer to as a drop shipment) and the third way is where we deliver the products to the customer and often also install the product (which we refer to as a local delivery). In the case of a local delivery, we load the product on to our own truck and deliver and install the product at the customer’s location. When a product is delivered through a local delivery, risk of loss passes to the customer at the time of installation and revenue is recognized upon installation at the customer’s location. In the case of a company shipment and a drop shipment, the delivery to the customer is made free on board, or FOB, shipping point (whether from our warehouse or a third party’s warehouse). Therefore, risk of loss and title transfers to the customer once the products are shipped (i.e., leaves our warehouse or a third-party’s warehouse). After shipment and prior to delivery, the customer is able to redirect the product to a different destination, which demonstrates the customer’s control over the product once shipped. Once the risk of loss has shifted to the customer, we have satisfied our performance obligation and we recognize revenue.
We agree with customers on the selling price of each transaction. This transaction price is generally based on the agreed upon sales price. In our contracts with customers, we allocate the entire transaction price to the sales price, which is the basis for the determination of the relative standalone selling price allocated to each performance obligation. Any sales tax, value added tax, and other tax we collect concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
Cost of revenue includes the cost of purchased merchandise plus the cost of shipping merchandise and where applicable installation, net of promotional rebates and other incentives received from vendors.
Substantially all our sales are to individual retail consumers.
Shipping and Handling - We bill our customers for shipping and handling charges, which are included in net sales for the applicable period, and the corresponding shipping and handling expense is reported in cost of sales.
Disaggregated Revenue - We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers by product type, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
We also sell extended warranty contracts. We are an agent for the warranty company and earn a commission on the warranty contracts purchased by customers; therefore, the cost of the warranty contracts is netted against warranty revenue in the our consolidated statement of operations. We assume no liability for repairs to products on which we have sold a warranty contract.
We experience seasonal trends which are primarily holidays such as Presidents Day, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas and Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Receivables
Receivables represent rebates receivable due from manufacturers from whom we purchase products and amounts due from credit card processors that do not settle within two days. Rebates receivable are stated at the amount that management expects to collect from manufacturers, net of accounts payable amounts due the vendor. Rebates are calculated on product and model sales programs from specific vendors. The rebates are paid at intermittent periods either in cash or through issuance of vendor credit memos, which can be applied against vendor accounts payable. Based on our assessment of the credit history with our manufacturers, we have concluded that there should be no allowance for uncollectible accounts. We historically collect substantially all of our outstanding rebates receivables. Uncollectible balances are expensed in the period it is determined to be uncollectible.
Merchandise Inventory
Inventory consists of finished products acquired for resale and is valued at the lower-of-cost-or-market with cost determined on an average item basis. We periodically evaluate the value of items in inventory and provide write-downs to inventory based on our estimate of market conditions.
Goodwill
We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually on December 31 and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and our consolidated financial results.
We test goodwill by estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the highest and best use of estimated future cash flows include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value and an estimate of a market participant’s weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows to their present value. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Intangible Assets
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, definite-lived intangible assets primarily consisted of tradenames and customer relationships which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, or 5 years.
We periodically evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. We have no intangibles with indefinite lives.
In applying the acquisition method of accounting, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment within one year of acquisitions or annually as of December 1, and whenever indicators of impairment exist. The fair values of intangible assets are compared against their carrying values, and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which a carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
Long-Lived Assets
We review our property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles (including ROU asset) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management upon triggering events. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Lease Liabilities
Lease liabilities and their corresponding right of use, or ROU, assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term at the lease commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an estimated incremental borrowing rate, or IBR, based on the information available at the commencement date of the respective lease to determine the present value of future payments. The determination of the IBR requires judgment and is primarily based on publicly available information for companies within the same industry and with similar credit profiles. We adjust the rate for the impact of collateralization, the lease term and other specific terms included in each lease arrangement. The IBR is determined at the lease commencement and is subsequently reassessed upon a modification to the lease arrangement.
Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We review the ROU asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the ROU asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the ROU asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the ROU asset. If the comparison indicates that an impairment exists, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the ROU asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the ROU asset.
