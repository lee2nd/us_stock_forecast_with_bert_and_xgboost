Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read this discussion together with the “Selected Financial Data” and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere herein.
Overview
We began operations in 1997 and, based on number of facilities, are one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we had operations in 46 states and the District of Columbia. We operated 99 critical illness recovery hospitals in 28 states, 30 rehabilitation hospitals in 12 states, and 1,788 outpatient rehabilitation clinics in 37 states and the District of Columbia. Concentra, a joint venture subsidiary, operated 517 occupational health centers in 41 states as of December 31, 2020. Concentra also provides contract services at employer worksites.
Our reportable segments include the critical illness recovery hospital segment, the rehabilitation hospital segment, the outpatient rehabilitation segment, and the Concentra segment. We had revenue of $5,531.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Of this total, we earned approximately 38% of our revenue from our critical illness recovery hospital segment, approximately 13% from our rehabilitation hospital segment, approximately 17% from our outpatient rehabilitation segment, and approximately 27% from our Concentra segment. Our critical illness recovery hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of patients recovering from critical illnesses, often with complex medical needs, and our rehabilitation hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve patients that require intensive physical rehabilitation care. Patients are typically admitted to our critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals from general acute care hospitals. Our outpatient rehabilitation segment consists of clinics that provide physical, occupational, and speech rehabilitation services. Our Concentra segment consists of occupational health centers that provide workers’ compensation injury care, physical therapy, and consumer health services as well as onsite clinics located at employer worksites that deliver occupational medicine services.
Non-GAAP Measure
We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, is important to investors because Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, income from operations, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying definitions, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, acquisition costs associated with Physiotherapy and U.S. HealthWorks, gain (loss) on sale of businesses, and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We will refer to Adjusted EBITDA throughout the remainder of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The table contained within “Selected Financial Data” reconciles net income and income from operations to Adjusted EBITDA and should be referenced when we discuss Adjusted EBITDA.
Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Results of Operations
The continuing implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. We provided monthly revenue and certain operating statistics for each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Segment. Our critical illness recovery hospitals are a key component of the inpatient hospital continuum of care. Beginning in March 2020, a number of waivers and modifications of certain requirements under the Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP programs were authorized, including certain regulations concerning patient length of stay requirements under the Medicare program which apply to our critical illness recovery hospitals. The length of stay requirements were suspended in order to facilitate the transfer of patients from general acute care hospitals and expand hospital bed capacity to care for COVID-19 patients (see “Regulatory Changes” for further discussion of the temporary suspension of regulations). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we played a critical role in caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic due, in part, to our rapid preparation and implementation of modifications that supported the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
The following table shows revenue, patient days, and occupancy rates for each of the periods presented, as well as the number of critical illness recovery hospitals we owned at the end of each period.

(1) Represents the number of hospitals owned at the end of each period presented.
Rehabilitation Hospital Segment. Our rehabilitation hospitals receive most of their admissions from general acute care hospitals. Beginning in March 2020, a number of waivers and modifications of certain requirements under the Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP programs were authorized, including certain regulations governing admissions into rehabilitation hospitals. This was done in order to facilitate the transfer of patients from general acute care hospitals and critical illness recovery hospitals and to expand hospital bed capacity to care for COVID-19 patients (see “Regulatory Changes” for further discussion of the temporary suspension of regulations). Our rehabilitation hospitals were affected by the suspension of elective surgeries at hospitals and other facilities at the beginning of the pandemic, which resulted in reduced need for inpatient rehabilitation services. Beginning in May 2020, state governments and health departments began to ease restrictions and hospitals began to perform elective surgeries again, which has increased the need for the services provided by our rehabilitation hospitals.
The following table shows revenue, patient days, and occupancy rates for each of the periods presented, as well as the number of rehabilitation hospitals we owned at the end of each period.
_____________________________________________________________________________
(1) Represents the number of hospitals owned at the end of each period presented.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Segment. Beginning in mid-March 2020, state governments began implementing mandatory closures of non-essential or non-life sustaining businesses, restricting travel and individual activities outside of the home, closing schools, and mandating other social distancing measures. Additionally, hospitals and other facilities began to suspend elective surgeries. As a result, our outpatient rehabilitation clinics experienced significantly less patient visit volume due to a decline in patient referrals from physicians, a reduction in workers’ compensation injury visits resulting from the temporary closure of businesses, and the suspension of elective surgeries which would have required outpatient rehabilitation services. Beginning in May 2020, state governments began to ease restrictions imposed on businesses and individuals, physician offices began reopening for routine office visits, and hospitals and other facilities began performing elective surgeries again, which resulted in an increased need for the services provided by our outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
The following table shows revenue and patient visits for each of the periods presented, as well as the number of working days for each period.

(1) Represents the number of days in which normal business operations were conducted during the periods presented.
Concentra Segment. Beginning in mid-March 2020, state governments began placing significant restrictions on businesses and mandating closures of non-essential or non-life sustaining businesses, causing many employers to furlough their workforce and temporarily cease or significantly reduce their operations. These actions had significant effects on our patient visit volumes. Beginning in May 2020, state governments began to ease restrictions imposed on businesses and employers began to increase their workforce, which resulted in an increased need for our occupational health services. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Concentra expanded its services to provide COVID-19 screening and testing at its centers and various onsite clinics located at employer worksites.
The following table shows revenue and patient visits for each of the periods presented, as well as the number of working days for each period.

Significant Events
Purchases of Concentra Interest
On January 1, 2020, February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, Select, WCAS and DHHC consummated the Concentra Interest Purchases, which were in lieu of, and collectively deemed to constitute, the exercises of WCAS’ and DHHC’s first and second Put Rights, pursuant to which Select acquired an aggregate amount of approximately 30% of the outstanding membership interests, on a fully diluted basis, of Concentra Group Holdings Parent from WCAS, DHHC and the other equity holders of Concentra Group Holdings Parent, in exchange for an aggregate payment of approximately $576.4 million. Upon consummation of the Concentra Interest Purchases, Select owns in the aggregate approximately 78.0% of the outstanding membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent on a fully diluted basis and approximately 79.8% of the outstanding voting membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent.
Regulatory Changes
The Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, which are generally persons age 65 and older, those who are chronically disabled, and those suffering from end stage renal disease. The program is governed by the Social Security Act of 1965 and is administered primarily by the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS. Revenue generated directly from the Medicare program represented approximately 27%, 26%, and 25% of the Company’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.
The Medicare program reimburses various types of providers using different payment methodologies. Those payment methodologies are complex and are described elsewhere in this report under “Business-Government Regulations.” The following is a discussion of some of the more significant healthcare regulatory changes that have affected our financial performance in the periods covered by this report or are likely to affect our financial performance and financial condition in the future.
Federal Health Care Program Changes in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
On January 31, 2020, HHS declared a public health emergency under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 247d, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. The HHS Secretary renewed the public health emergency determination for 90-day periods effective on April 26, 2020, July 25, 2020, and October 23, 2020. On March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a national emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the HHS Secretary authorized the waiver or modification of certain requirements under the Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP pursuant to section 1135 of the Social Security Act. Under this authority, CMS issued a number of blanket waivers that excuse health care providers or suppliers from specific program requirements. The following blanket waivers, while in effect, may impact our results of operations:
i.IRFs, IRF units, and hospitals and units applying to be classified as IRFs, can exclude patients admitted solely to respond to the emergency from the calculation of the “60 percent rule” thresholds to receive payment as an IRF.
ii.LTCHs are exempt from the greater-than-25-day average length of stay requirement for all cost reporting periods that include the COVID-19 public health emergency period. Hospitals seeking LTCH classification can exclude patient stays from the greater-than-25-day average length of stay requirement where the patient was admitted or discharged to meet the demands of the COVID-19 public health emergency.
iii.Medicare expanded the types of health care professionals who can furnish telehealth services to include all those who are eligible to bill Medicare for their professional services. This allows health care professionals who were previously ineligible to furnish and bill for Medicare telehealth services, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, and others, to receive payment for Medicare telehealth services.
iv.Medicare will not require out-of-state physician and non-physician practitioners to be licensed in the state where they are providing services when they are licensed in another state, subject to certain conditions and state or local licensure requirements.
v.Many requirements under the hospital conditions of participation (“CoPs”) are waived during the emergency period to give hospitals more flexibility in treating COVID-19 patients.
vi.Hospitals can operate temporary expansion locations without meeting the provider-based entity requirements or certain requirements in the physical environment CoP for hospitals during the emergency. This waiver also allows hospitals to change the status of their current provider-based department locations to meet patient needs as part of the state or local pandemic plan.
vii.IRFs, LTCHs and certain other providers did not need to submit quality data to Medicare for October 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 to comply with the quality reporting programs.
viii.The HHS Secretary waived sanctions under the physician self-referral law (i.e., Stark law) for certain types of remuneration and referral arrangements that are related to a COVID-19 purpose. The OIG will also exercise enforcement discretion to not impose administrative sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute for many payments covered by the Stark law waivers.
CMS also approved section 1135 waivers for 54 state Medicaid programs (including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories), 51 temporary changes to Medicaid or CHIP state plan amendments, 3 traditional changes to Medicaid state plan amendments, and section 1115 waivers for 10 state Medicaid demonstration projects addressing the COVID-19 public health emergency. CMS will consider specific waiver requests from providers and suppliers. We have submitted one or more specific waiver requests to make it easier for our operators or referral partners to treat COVID-19 patients, and we may submit others in the future.
Pursuant to the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, Public Law 116-123, CMS has waived Medicare telehealth payment requirements during the emergency so that beneficiaries in all areas of the country (not just rural areas) can receive telehealth services, including in their homes, beginning on March 6, 2020. CMS issued additional waivers to permit more than 130 additional services to be furnished by telehealth, allow physicians to monitor patient services remotely, and fulfill face-to-face requirements in IRFs.
In addition to these agency actions, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020. It provides additional waivers, reimbursement, grants and other funds to assist health care providers during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Some of the CARES Act provisions that may impact our operations include:
i.$100 billion in appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund to be used for preventing, preparing, and responding to COVID-19, and for reimbursing “eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.” The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, Public Law 116-139, added $75 billion to this fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, added another $3 billion to this fund. HHS has allocated three general distributions from the fund for payments to Medicare providers. The Phase 1 General Distribution included $30 billion for health care providers that received Medicare fee-for-service payments in 2019. Another $20 billion was distributed to Medicare providers in a manner that makes the entire $50 billion Phase 1 General Distribution proportional to each provider’s share of 2018 net patient revenue. The Phase 2 General Distribution allocated $18 billion for providers in state Medicaid/CHIP programs, Medicaid managed care plans, dentists, and certain Medicare providers who did not receive a Phase 1 General Distribution payment. The Phase 3 General Distribution includes $20 billion for providers to apply for if they suffered financial losses caused by COVID-19 or if they were previously ineligible for a general distribution. The remainder of the COVID-19 related appropriations to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund is for targeted allocations to providers in high impact COVID-19 areas ($22 billion), rural providers (approximately $11.3 billion), skilled nursing facilities (approximately $7.4 billion), safety net hospitals (approximately $14.7 billion), Indian Health Service ($500 million), and unspecified allocations for providers treating uninsured COVID-19 patients. HHS also established a $2 billion incentive payment structure for skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes for keeping new COVID-19 infection and mortality rates among residents lower than the communities they serve.
ii.Expansion of the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to advance three months of payments to Medicare providers. CMS has the ability to recoup the advanced payments through future Medicare claims. Section 2501 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act, Public Law 116-159, modified the terms of repayment so that a provider can request no recoupment for one year after the advanced payment was issued, followed by a 25% offset the next 11 months, and a 50% offset the last 6 months. Any amounts that remain unpaid after 29 months will be subject to a 4% interest rate (instead of 10.25%).
iii.Temporary suspension of the 2% cut to Medicare payments due to sequestration so that, for the period of May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, the Medicare program will be exempt from any sequestration order. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, extended this temporary suspension of the 2% sequestration cut through March 31, 2021.
iv.Two waivers of Medicare statutory requirements regarding site neutral payment to LTCHs. The first waives the LTCH discharge payment percentage requirement (i.e., 50% rule) for the cost reporting period(s) that include the emergency period. The second waives application of the site neutral payment rate so that all LTCH cases admitted during the emergency period will be paid the LTCH-PPS standard federal rate.
v.Waiver of the IRF 3-hour rule so that IRF services provided during the public health emergency period do not need to meet the coverage requirement that patients receive at least 3 hours of therapy a day or 15 hours of therapy per week.
vi.Broader waiver authority for HHS under section 1135 of the Social Security Act to issue additional telehealth waivers.
The CARES Act also provides for a 20% increase in the payment weight for Medicare payments to hospitals paid under the IPPS for treating COVID-19 patients. We are monitoring developments related to this provision, in case CMS provides a similar payment add-on for LTCHs and IRFs.
Medicare Reimbursement of LTCH Services
The following is a summary of significant regulatory changes to the Medicare prospective payment system for our critical illness recovery hospitals, which are certified by Medicare as LTCHs, which have affected our results of operations, as well as the policies and payment rates that may affect our future results of operations. Medicare payments to our critical illness recovery hospitals are made in accordance with LTCH-PPS.
Fiscal Year 2019. On August 17, 2018, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2019 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published October 3, 2018. The standard federal rate was set at $41,559, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2018 of $41,415. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2019 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.8%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget-neutrality factor of 0.999215 and a temporary, one-time budget-neutrality adjustment of 0.990878 in connection with the elimination of the 25 Percent Rule. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $27,121, a decrease from the fixed-loss amount in the 2018 fiscal year of $27,381. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $25,743, a decrease from the fixed-loss amount in the 2018 fiscal year of $26,537.
Fiscal Year 2020. On August 16, 2019, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2020 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published October 8, 2019. The standard federal rate was set at $42,678, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2019 of $41,559. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2020 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.4%. The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget neutrality factor of 1.0020203 and a temporary, one-time budget neutrality adjustment of 0.999858 in connection with the elimination of the 25 Percent Rule. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $26,778, a decrease from the fixed-loss amount in the 2019 fiscal year of $27,121. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $26,552, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2019 fiscal year of $25,743. For LTCH discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2020, site neutral payment rate cases will begin to be paid fully on the site neutral payment rate, rather than the transitional blended rate. However, the CARES Act waives the site neutral payment rate for patients admitted during the COVID-19 emergency period and in response to the public health emergency, as discussed above.
Fiscal Year 2021. On September 18, 2020, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the LTCH-PPS for fiscal year 2021 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021). Certain errors in the final rule were corrected in a document published December 7, 2020. The standard federal rate was set at $43,755, an increase from the standard federal rate applicable during fiscal year 2020 of $42,678. The update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year 2021 included a market basket increase of 2.3% with no productivity adjustment. The standard federal rate also included an area wage budget neutrality factor of 1.0016837 and a permanent, one-time budget neutrality adjustment of 1.000517 in connection with the elimination of the 25 Percent Rule. As a result of the CARES Act, all LTCH cases are paid at the standard federal rate during the public health emergency. If the public health emergency ends during fiscal year 2021, then CMS will return to using the site-neutral payment rate for reimbursement of cases that do not meet the LTCH patient criteria. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under LTCH-PPS was set at $27,195, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2020 fiscal year of $26,778. The fixed-loss amount for high cost outlier cases paid under the site-neutral payment rate was set at $29,064, an increase from the fixed-loss amount in the 2020 fiscal year of $26,552.
Medicare Reimbursement of IRF Services
The following is a summary of significant regulatory changes to the Medicare prospective payment system for our rehabilitation hospitals, which are certified by Medicare as IRFs, which have affected our results of operations, as well as the policies and payment rates that may affect our future results of operations. Medicare payments to our rehabilitation hospitals are made in accordance with IRF-PPS.
Fiscal Year 2019. On August 6, 2018, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2019 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2019 was set at $16,021, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2018 of $15,838. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2019 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.8%, and less a reduction of 0.75% mandated by the ACA. CMS increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2019 to $9,402 from $8,679 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2018.
Fiscal Year 2020. On August 8, 2019, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2020 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2020 was set at $16,489, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2019 of $16,021. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2020 included a market basket increase of 2.9%, less a productivity adjustment of 0.4%. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2020 to $9,300 from $9,402 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2019.
Fiscal Year 2021. On August 10, 2020, CMS published the final rule updating policies and payment rates for the IRF-PPS for fiscal year 2021 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021). The standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year 2021 was set at $16,856, an increase from the standard payment conversion factor applicable during fiscal year 2020 of $16,489. The update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2021 included a market basket increase of 2.4% with no productivity adjustment. CMS decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year 2021 to $7,906 from $9,300 established in the final rule for fiscal year 2020.
Medicare Reimbursement of Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinic Services
Outpatient rehabilitation providers enroll in Medicare as a rehabilitation agency, a clinic, or a public health agency. The Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare physician fee schedule. For services provided in 2017 through 2019, a 0.5% update was applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to an adjustment beginning in 2019 under the MIPS. In 2019, CMS added physical and occupational therapists to the list of MIPS eligible clinicians. For these therapists in private practice, payments under the fee schedule are subject to adjustment in a later year based on their performance in MIPS according to established performance standards. Calendar year 2021 is the first year that payments are adjusted, based upon the therapist’s performance under MIPS in 2019. Providers in facility-based outpatient therapy settings are excluded from MIPS eligibility and therefore not subject to this payment adjustment. For services provided in 2020 through 2025, a 0.0% percent update will be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates, subject to adjustments under MIPS and the APMs. In 2026 and subsequent years, eligible professionals participating in APMs who meet certain criteria would receive annual updates of 0.75%, while all other professionals would receive annual updates of 0.25%.
Each year from 2019 through 2024 eligible clinicians who receive a significant share of their revenues through an advanced APM (such as accountable care organizations or bundled payment arrangements) that involves risk of financial losses and a quality measurement component will receive a 5% bonus. The bonus payment for APM participation is intended to encourage participation and testing of new APMs and to promote the alignment of incentives across payors.
In the 2020 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule, CMS revised coding, documentation guidelines, and increased the valuation for E/M office visit codes, beginning in 2021. Because the Medicare physician fee schedule is budget-neutral, any revaluation of E/M services that will increase spending by more than $20 million will require a budget neutrality adjustment. To increase values for the E/M codes while maintaining budget neutrality under the fee schedule, CMS cut the values of other codes to make up the difference, beginning in 2021.
In the 2021 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule, CMS increased the values for the E/M office visit codes and cuts to other specialty codes to maintain budget neutrality. As a result, therapy services provided in our outpatient rehabilitation clinics will receive an estimated 3.6% decrease in payment from Medicare in calendar year 2021. Legislation was introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would waive the budget neutrality requirement with respect to the E/M codes for 2021 in order to avoid or minimize cuts to physical and occupational therapy services and other code values. Separately, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, provides a one-time 3.75% increase in payments in calendar year 2021 for therapy services and other services paid under the physician fee schedule.

In the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule for calendar year 2019, CMS established two new modifiers (CQ and CO) to identify services furnished in whole or in part by PTAs or OTAs. These modifiers were mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which requires that claims for outpatient therapy services furnished in whole or part by therapy assistants on or after January 1, 2020 include the appropriate modifier. CMS intends to use these modifiers to implement a payment differential that would reimburse services provided by PTAs and OTAs at 85% of the fee schedule rate beginning on January 1, 2022. In the final 2020 Medicare physician fee schedule rule, CMS clarified that when the physical therapist is involved for the entire duration of the service and the PTA provides skilled therapy alongside the physical therapist, the CQ modifier is not required. Also, when the same service (code) is furnished separately by the physical therapist and PTA, CMS will apply the de minimis standard to each 15-minute unit of codes, not on the total physical therapist and PTA time of the service, allowing the separate reporting, on two different claim lines, of the number of units to which the new modifiers apply and the number of units to which the modifiers do not apply.
Critical Accounting Matters
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
Our principal revenue source comes from providing healthcare services to patients. Patient service revenues are recognized at an amount equal to the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for providing healthcare services to our patients. Revenue earned from these services is variable in nature, as we are required to make judgments that impact the transaction price.
We determine the transaction price for services provided to patients who are Medicare beneficiaries using Medicare’s prospective payment systems and other payment methods. The expected payment is determined by the level of clinical services provided and is sensitive to the patient’s length of stay. Additionally, we are paid by various other non-Medicare payor sources including, but not limited to, insurance companies (including Medicare Advantage plans), state Medicaid programs, workers’ compensation programs, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, other managed care companies and employers, as well as patients themselves. The transaction price for services provided to non-Medicare patients include amounts prescribed by state and federal fee schedules, negotiated contracted amounts, or usual and customary amounts associated with the specific payor or based on the service provided. We apply a portfolio approach in determining revenues for certain homogeneous non-Medicare patient populations.
The transaction price for services provided to our patients is also impacted by factors, such as the patient’s condition and length of stay, which in turn impact the payment we expect to receive for providing such services. Variable consideration included in the transaction price is inclusive of our estimates of implicit discounts and other adjustments related to timely filing and documentation denials, out of network adjustments, and medical necessity denials, which are estimated using our historical experience. We are also subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations, and audits of the claims we submit for services provided. Some claims can take several years for resolution and may result in adjustments to the transaction price. Management includes in its estimates of the transaction price its expectations for these types of adjustments such that the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not be subject to significant reversal in future periods. Historically, adjustments arising from a change in the transaction price have not been significant.
Our accounts receivable is reported at an amount equal to the amount we expect to collect for providing healthcare services to our patients. Because our accounts receivable is typically paid for by highly-solvent, creditworthy payors, such as Medicare, other governmental programs, and highly-regulated commercial insurers on behalf of the patient, our credit losses are infrequent and insignificant in nature; as such, we generally do not recognize allowances for expected credit losses.
Insurance Risk Programs
Under a number of our insurance programs, which include our employee health insurance, workers’ compensation, and professional malpractice liability insurance programs, we are liable for a portion of our losses before we can attempt to recover from the applicable insurance carrier. We accrue for losses under an occurrence-based approach, whereby we estimate the losses that will be incurred in a respective accounting period and accrue that estimated liability using actuarial methods. We monitor these programs quarterly and revise our estimates as necessary to take into account additional information. We recorded a liability of $157.1 million and $173.6 million for our estimated losses under these insurance programs at December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We also recorded insurance proceeds receivable of $15.5 million and $13.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, for liabilities which exceed our deductibles and self-insured retention limits and are recoverable through our insurance policies.
Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to periodic impairment evaluations. Impairment tests are required to be conducted at least annually or when events or conditions occur that might suggest a possible impairment. These events or conditions include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business environment, regulatory environment, or legal factors; a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of continuing losses; or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. The occurrence of one of these events or conditions could significantly impact an impairment assessment, necessitating an impairment charge.
We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for each of our reporting units as of October 1, 2020. Our assessment was qualitative in nature and considered whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We considered relevant events or circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could affect the fair value of a reporting unit, including (i) industry and market conditions, (ii) financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows, or a decline in revenue or earnings compared with actual and forecasted results, (iii) the regulatory environment affecting each of our reporting units, including reimbursement and compliance requirements under the Medicare program, and (iv) other factors specific to each reporting unit, such as a change in strategy, management, or acquisitions or divestitures affecting the composition of the reporting unit. Our assessment did not indicate goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units as of October 1, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, our other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks, certificates of need, and accreditations. To determine the fair value of our trademarks, we use a relief from royalty income approach. For our certificates of need and accreditations, we perform qualitative assessments. As part of these assessments, we evaluate the current business environment, regulatory environment, legal and other company-specific factors. If it is more likely than not that the fair values are less than the carrying values, we perform quantitative impairment tests. Our most recent impairment assessments for indefinite-lived intangible assets were completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. We did not identify any instances of impairment with respect to indefinite-lived intangible assets.
We have recorded total goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of $3.8 billion at December 31, 2020, of which $1.1 billion related to our critical illness recovery hospital reporting unit, $458.4 million related to our rehabilitation hospital reporting unit, $701.2 million related to our outpatient rehabilitation reporting unit, and $1.5 billion relates to the Concentra reporting unit.
Realization of Deferred Tax Assets
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We also recognize the future tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards as deferred tax assets. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and reduce those assets using a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are projections of future taxable income streams, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. However, changes in tax codes, statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period.
At December 31, 2020, we had deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets of approximately $111.7 million principally due to depreciation deductions that have been accelerated for tax purposes and amortization of intangibles and goodwill. This amount includes approximately $17.3 million of valuation reserves related primarily to state net operating losses.
Operating Statistics
The following table sets forth operating statistics for each of our segments for the periods presented. The operating statistics reflect data for the period of time we managed these operations. Our operating statistics include metrics we believe provide relevant insight about the number of facilities we operate, volume of services we provide to our patients, and average payment rates for services we provide. These metrics are utilized by management to monitor trends and performance in our businesses and therefore may be important to investors because management may assess our performance based in part on such metrics. Other healthcare providers may present similar statistics, and these statistics are susceptible to varying definitions. Our statistics as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled statistics of other companies.

Please refer to “Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Results of Operations” above for further discussion.
Revenue
Our revenue increased 1.4% to $5,531.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5,453.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Segment. Revenue increased 13.1% to $2,077.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,836.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue was due to increases in both patient volume and revenue per patient day during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our patient days increased 7.1% to 1,111,756 days for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1,038,361 days for the year ended December 31, 2019. We experienced a 4.8% increase in patient days in our existing critical illness recovery hospitals. The remaining increase principally occurred in the four critical illness recovery hospitals we acquired in 2019. The relaxation of certain admission restrictions during the year ended December 31, 2020 also contributed to the increase in volume. These measures were implemented to increase hospital capacity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Occupancy in our critical illness recovery hospitals increased to 71% during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 68% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue per patient day increased 6.0% to $1,858 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,753 for the year ended December 31, 2019. We experienced increases in both our Medicare and non-Medicare revenue per patient day. Our critical illness recovery hospitals experienced an increase in patient acuity during the year ended December 31, 2020, which contributed to the increase in Medicare revenue per patient day. We also experienced an increase in revenue per patient day as a result of the temporary suspension of the 2.0% cut to Medicare payments due to sequestration, which is described further under “Regulatory Changes.”
Rehabilitation Hospital Segment. Revenue increased 9.5% to $734.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $671.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue resulted from increases in both patient volume and revenue per patient day during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our patient days increased 5.0% to 370,833 days for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 353,031 days for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in patient days was principally driven by our rehabilitation hospitals which commenced operations during 2019. We also experienced a 2.0% increase in patient days in our existing rehabilitation hospitals. This increase occurred despite declines in volume experienced within our rehabilitation hospitals in New Jersey and South Florida which temporarily restricted admissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain of our rehabilitation hospitals also experienced lower patient volume due to the suspension of elective surgeries at hospitals and other facilities, which consequently reduced the demand for inpatient rehabilitation services, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These declines in volume principally occurred in April and May 2020. Occupancy in our rehabilitation hospitals increased to 78% during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 76% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our revenue per patient day increased 6.4% to $1,793 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,685 for the year ended December 31, 2019. We experienced increases in both our Medicare and non-Medicare revenue per patient day. The temporary suspension of the 2.0% cut to Medicare payments due to sequestration, which is described further under “Regulatory Changes,” contributed to the increase in revenue per patient day.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Segment. Revenue was $919.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,046.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in visits, which were 7,593,344 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 8,719,282 visits for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 12.9%. During the months of March through December 2020, our outpatient rehabilitation clinics experienced a 17.3% decrease in visits, as compared to the same period in 2019, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The declines in volume principally occurred in April and May 2020 and were the result of a decline in patient referrals from physicians, a reduction in workers’ compensation injury visits resulting from the temporary closure of businesses, the suspension of elective surgeries which would have required outpatient rehabilitation services, as well as recommendations to practice social distancing. Patient volume in our outpatient rehabilitation clinics has improved since April and May 2020 as restrictions imposed on individuals and businesses ease. Refer to the “Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Results of Operations” for a table which outlines the monthly trend in our patient visits for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our revenue per visit was $104 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $103 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Concentra Segment. Revenue was $1,501.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,628.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in visits, which were 10,627,904 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 12,068,865 visits for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 11.9%. During the months of March through December 2020, our centers experienced a 15.1% decrease in visits, as compared to the same period in 2019, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The declines in volume principally occurred in April and May 2020 and were primarily due to employers furloughing their workforce and temporarily ceasing or significantly reducing their operations. Patient volume in our centers has improved since April and May 2020 as restrictions imposed on businesses ease. Refer to the“Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Results of Operations” for a table which outlines the monthly trend in our patient visits for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The sale of Concentra’s Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic business on September 1, 2020 also contributed to the decline in revenue. This business contributed $28.5 million of revenue to the Concentra segment during the months of September through December 2019. The declines in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 were offset, in part, by the revenue earned from providing COVID-19 screening and testing at our centers and various onsite clinics located at employer worksites. These services contributed $62.0 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue per visit was $123 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $122 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist principally of cost of services and general and administrative expenses. Our operating expenses were $4,848.4 million, or 87.7% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4,769.5 million, or 87.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our cost of services, a major component of which is labor expense, was $4,710.4 million, or 85.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4,641.0 million, or 85.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in our operating expenses relative to our revenue was principally due to the reduced patient volume in our outpatient rehabilitation and Concentra segments, as discussed above. General and administrative expenses were $138.0 million, or 2.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $128.5 million, or 2.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Operating Income
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had other operating income of $90.0 million. We recognize payments received under the Provider Relief Fund as other operating income for health care related expenses and loss of revenue attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Note 22 - CARES Act of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further information. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $88.9 million of other operating income is included within the operating results of our other activities, and $1.1 million of other operating income is included in the operating results of our Concentra segment.
Adjusted EBITDA
Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.4% to $342.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the critical illness recovery hospital segment was 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for our critical illness recovery hospital segment were driven by increases in both patient volume and revenue per patient day, as discussed above under “Revenue.” The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin occurred despite the incurrence of additional operating expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our critical illness recovery hospitals have modified certain of their protocols in order to follow the guidelines and recommendations for patient treatment and for the protection of both our patients and staff members. This has resulted in increased labor costs, including increased contracted labor usage, as well as additional costs resulting from the purchase of personal protective equipment.
Rehabilitation Hospital Segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.8% to $153.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $135.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the rehabilitation hospital segment was 20.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were primarily attributable to our hospitals which commenced operations in 2019. We also experienced increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin at many of our existing hospitals as a result of increased patient volume and increases in revenue per patient day. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our rehabilitation hospital segment occurred despite our hospitals in New Jersey and South Florida experiencing declines in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. These hospitals temporarily restricted admissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were also adversely impacted by the incurrence of additional operating expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our rehabilitation hospitals have modified certain of their protocols in order to follow the guidelines and recommendations for patient treatment and for the protection of both our patients and staff members. This has resulted in increased labor costs as well as additional costs resulting from the purchase of personal protective equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Adjusted EBITDA results of the rehabilitation hospital segment include start-up losses of approximately $8.8 million.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Segment. Adjusted EBITDA was $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $151.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the outpatient rehabilitation segment was 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were caused by a decline in visits, beginning in mid-March 2020, as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above. During the months of March through December 2020, our outpatient rehabilitation clinics experienced a 17.3% decrease in visits, as compared to the same period in 2019. In response to the decline in patient volume and in an effort to reduce operating expenses, we temporarily consolidated, where possible, the operations of clinics which operate within close proximity to one another and took other measures to reduce labor costs.
Concentra Segment. Adjusted EBITDA was $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $276.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Concentra segment was 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were caused by a decline in visits, beginning in mid-March 2020, as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above. During the months of March through December 2020, our centers experienced a 15.1% decrease in visits, as compared to the same period in 2019. In response to the decline in patient volume and in an effort to reduce operating expenses, we temporarily consolidated, where possible, the operations of centers which operate within close proximity to one another, reduced the operating hours of certain centers, and took other measures to reduce labor and other discretionary costs. Many of these initiatives have been and will continue to be curtailed as we see improvement in patient volumes.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $205.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense occurred in our Concentra segment. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to certain assets acquired as part of the acquisitions of U.S. HealthWorks, Inc. and Concentra Inc. becoming fully depreciated.
Income from Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had income from operations of $567.7 million, compared to $471.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to the recognition of $90.0 million of other operating income, as discussed above. We also experienced increases in income from operations within our critical illness recovery hospital and rehabilitation hospital segments, which were offset in part by declines in income from operations experienced within our outpatient rehabilitation and Concentra segments.
Loss on Early Retirement of Debt
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we amended both the Select credit agreement and the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement. We also repaid the term loans outstanding under both the Concentra-JPM first and second lien credit agreements and redeemed our 6.375% senior notes. These financing events resulted in losses on early retirement of debt of $38.1 million.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries relates to rehabilitation businesses and other healthcare-related businesses in which we are a minority owner. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $29.4 million, compared to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, certain of our non-consolidating subsidiaries received Provider Relief Funds for health care related expenses and loss of revenue attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced an increase in our equity in earnings for our share of the income recognized from these funds.
Gain on Sale of Businesses
We recognized gains of $12.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold an outpatient rehabilitation business, a rehabilitation hospital business, and Concentra’s Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic business. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $21.4 million. We also incurred a loss of $9.0 million related to the indemnity provision associated with a previously sold business.
We recognized a gain of $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain was attributable to the sale of outpatient rehabilitation clinics to a non-consolidating subsidiary.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $153.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to a decline in variable interest rates, as well as the refinancing of our Select credit facilities, Concentra-JPM first and second lien credit agreements, and senior notes during the third and fourth quarters of 2019.
Income Taxes
We recorded income tax expense of $111.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented an effective tax rate of 24.5%. We recorded income tax expense of $63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented an effective tax rate of 24.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from a higher estimate of state and local income taxes. Refer to Note 19 - Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for the reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to general improvements made in the operating performance of the Company’s less than wholly owned critical illness recovery and rehabilitation hospitals, particularly in our hospitals which commenced operations during 2019, net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased as a result of the operating income recognized for payments received under the Provider Relief Fund. Additionally, the net income of our Concentra segment increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was principally due to a decline in interest expense. The Concentra segment also recognized a loss on early retirement of debt during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
In the following, we discuss our results of operations related to revenue, operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, income from operations, loss on early retirement of debt, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, gain on sale of businesses, interest expense, income taxes, and net income attributable to non-controlling interests.
Revenue
Our revenue increased 7.3% to $5,453.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5,081.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Segment. Revenue increased 4.7% to $1,836.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,753.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue was due to increases in both patient volume and revenue per patient day. Our patient days increased 2.6% to 1,038,361 days for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 1,012,368 days for the year ended December 31, 2018. The acquisition of four hospitals during 2019 contributed to the increase in patient days. We also experienced an increase in patient days in our existing hospitals, which was offset by a decrease in patient days from hospital closures which occurred during 2018, including the temporary closure of our hospital located in Panama City, Florida as a result of damage sustained from Hurricane Michael in October 2018. Revenue per patient day increased 2.2% to $1,753 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,716 for the year ended December 31, 2018. We experienced increases in both our Medicare and non-Medicare revenue per patient day.
Rehabilitation Hospital Segment. Revenue increased 14.9% to $671.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $583.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue resulted from increases in both patient volume and revenue per patient day during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our patient days increased 11.9% to 353,031 days for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 315,468 days for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in patient days was principally driven by our rehabilitation hospitals which recently commenced operations. We also experienced a 3.7% increase in patient days in our existing hospitals. Our revenue per patient day increased 4.9% to $1,685 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,606 for the year ended December 31, 2018. We experienced increases in both our Medicare and non-Medicare revenue per patient day.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Segment. Revenue increased 5.0% to $1,046.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $995.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue was attributable to an increase in visits, which increased 4.3% to 8,719,282 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 8,356,018 visits for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in visits was due to new outpatient rehabilitation clinics and a 5.1% increase in visits within our existing clinics. This growth was offset in part by the sale of outpatient rehabilitation clinics to non-consolidating subsidiaries. These clinics contributed 218,381 visits during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we also experienced an increase in management fee revenues related to services provided to our non-consolidating subsidiaries. These services have expanded as a result of our sales of clinics to these non-consolidating subsidiaries. Our revenue per visit was $103 for both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Concentra Segment. Revenue increased 4.6% to $1,628.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,557.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Visits in our centers increased 5.6% to 12,068,865 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 11,426,940 visits for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increases in revenue and visits were principally due to U.S. HealthWorks, which we acquired on February 1, 2018, and other new centers. Revenue per visit was $122 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $124 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in revenue per visit was principally due to a relative increase in employer services visits, which yield lower per visit rates.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist principally of cost of services and general and administrative expenses. Our operating expenses were $4,769.5 million, or 87.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4,462.3 million, or 87.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our cost of services, a major component of which is labor expense, was $4,641.0 million, or 85.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4,341.1 million, or 85.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in our operating expenses relative to our revenue was principally due to the operating performance of our Concentra and rehabilitation hospital segments. General and administrative expenses were $128.5 million, or 2.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $121.3 million, or 2.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expenses included $2.9 million of U.S. HealthWorks acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA
Critical Illness Recovery Hospital Segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.9% to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $243.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the critical illness recovery hospital segment was 13.9% for both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for our critical illness recovery hospital segment was primarily driven by increases in patient volumes and revenue per patient day, as discussed above under “Revenue.” Our Adjusted EBITDA margins were impacted by our newly acquired hospitals, which operated at lower margins than our other critical illness recovery hospitals.
Rehabilitation Hospital Segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24.7% to $135.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $108.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the rehabilitation hospital segment was 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are primarily attributable to increases in patient volume and revenue per patient day at many of our existing hospitals. Adjusted EBITDA losses in our start-up hospitals were $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Outpatient Rehabilitation Segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.9% to $151.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $142.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the outpatient rehabilitation segment was 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA resulted principally from increases in patient visits in our existing clinics, as discussed above under “Revenue.” We also experienced increases in Adjusted EBITDA from our start-up and newly developed outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Concentra Segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.7% to $276.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $252.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which included the operating results of U.S. HealthWorks beginning February 1, 2018. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Concentra segment was 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin resulted from achieving lower relative operating costs across our combined Concentra and U.S. HealthWorks businesses.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $201.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase principally occurred within our critical illness recovery hospital and rehabilitation hospital segments. The increase resulted in part from new hospitals operating within both of these segments. Additionally, effective July 1, 2019, the state of Florida repealed its certificate of need regulations; accordingly, the certificate of need intangible assets previously recognized by our Florida critical illness recovery hospitals were fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income from Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had income from operations of $471.9 million, compared to $417.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in income from operations resulted principally from our Concentra and rehabilitation hospital segments.
Loss on Early Retirement of Debt
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we amended both the Select credit agreement and the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement. We also repaid the term loans outstanding under both the Concentra-JPM first and second lien credit agreements and redeemed our 6.375% senior notes. These financing events resulted in losses on early retirement of debt of $38.1 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we amended both the Select credit agreement and the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement which resulted in losses on early retirement of debt of $14.2 million.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries principally relates to rehabilitation businesses in which we are a minority owner. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $25.0 million, compared to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in equity in earnings was principally attributable to the growth of certain non-consolidating subsidiaries as a result of our sales of outpatient rehabilitation clinics to these subsidiaries.
Gain on Sale of Businesses
We recognized gains of $6.5 million and $9.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The gains were principally attributable to the sales of outpatient rehabilitation clinics to non-consolidating subsidiaries.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was principally due to the recognition of interest expense on both the 6.250% senior notes and the 6.375% senior notes during August 2019, as the redemption of the $710.0 million 6.375% senior notes occurred on August 30, 2019, while the issuance of the $550.0 million 6.250% senior notes occurred on August 1, 2019.
Income Taxes
We recorded income tax expense of $63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented an effective tax rate of 24.1%. We recorded income tax expense of $58.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represented an effective tax rate of 24.9%.
The reduction in our effective tax rate resulted from an increase in our income before income taxes generated from our consolidated subsidiaries taxed as partnerships. For these subsidiaries, we only incur income tax expense on our share of the earnings. The effect of the income allocated to non-controlling interests on the effective tax rate was 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 19 - Income Taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for the reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was principally due to the improved operating performance of several of our joint venture rehabilitation hospitals and our Concentra segment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020
In the following, we discuss cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
Operating activities provided $1,028.1 million of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $445.2 million of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to $318.1 million of advanced payments received under the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, as well as $172.6 million of payments received under the Provider Relief Fund. Refer to Note 22 - CARES Act of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
Our days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2020, while our days sales outstanding was 51 days at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our days sales outstanding will fluctuate based upon variability in our collection cycles and patient volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our days sales outstanding was primarily impacted by an increase in our Medicare receivables at our hospitals.
Operating activities provided $445.2 million of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $494.2 million of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018. The lower operating cash flows were principally driven by the change in our accounts receivable. Our days sales outstanding was 51 days at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, while our days sales outstanding was 58 days at December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced an increase in operating cash flows related to accounts receivable, primarily as a result of underpayments we received through the Medicare periodic interim payment program in our critical illness recovery hospitals during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Investing activities used $115.4 million, $316.7 million and $697.1 million of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the principal uses of cash were $146.4 million for purchases of property and equipment and $52.2 million for investments in and acquisitions of businesses. We also received proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses of $83.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the principal uses of cash were $157.1 million for purchases of property and equipment and $159.8 million for investments in and acquisitions of businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the principal uses of cash were $515.6 million related to the acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks and $167.3 million for purchases of property and equipment.
Financing activities used $671.5 million of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The principal use of cash was $576.4 million for the purchase of additional membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent during the year ended December 31, 2020, as discussed above under “Other Significant Events.” We also used $39.8 million of cash for the mandatory prepayment of term loans under the Select credit facilities.
Financing activities provided $32.3 million of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. The principal sources of cash were from the issuance of $1,225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% senior notes, $1,115.0 million of incremental term loan borrowings under the Select credit facilities, and $100.0 million of incremental term loan borrowings under the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement. These borrowings provided net financing cash inflows of $2,453.1 million. A portion of the net proceeds of the 6.250% senior notes, together with a portion of the proceeds from the incremental term loan borrowings under the Select credit facilities, were used by Select to redeem in full its $710.0 million 6.375% senior notes and to make a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,240.3 million to Concentra Inc., pursuant to the Concentra intercompany loan agreement. Concentra Inc. then repaid its $1,240.3 million term loan outstanding under the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement. The proceeds from the incremental term loans under the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement were used, in part, to repay the $240.0 million of term loans outstanding under the Concentra-JPM second lien credit agreement. We also used $98.8 million and $33.9 million of cash for mandatory prepayments of term loans under the Select credit facilities and Concentra-JPM first and second lien credit agreements, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had net repayments of $20.0 million under the Select and Concentra-JPM revolving facilities.
Financing activities provided $255.6 million of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018. The principal source of cash was from the issuance of term loans under the Concentra-JPM first and second lien credit agreements which resulted in net proceeds of $779.8 million. This was offset in part by $311.5 million of distributions to and purchases of non-controlling interests, of which $294.9 million related to the redemption and reorganization transactions executed in connection with the acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks, and $210.0 million of net repayments under the Select revolving facility.
Capital Resources
Working capital. We had net working capital of $155.6 million at December 31, 2020, compared to net working capital of $298.7 million at December 31, 2019. Our net working capital as of December 31, 2020 was impacted by the purchases of additional membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent, including the most recent purchase which occurred on December 31, 2020, as discussed above under “Other Significant Events.”
A significant component of our working capital is our accounts receivable. Collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our liquidity and capital resources. Most of our patients are subject to healthcare coverage through third party payor arrangements, including Medicare and Medicaid. It is our general policy to verify healthcare coverage prior to providing services. We have credit risk associated with our accounts receivable; however, we believe there is a remote possibility of default with these payors.
Select credit facilities.
In February 2020, Select made a principal prepayment of approximately $39.8 million associated with its term loans in accordance with the provision in the Select credit facilities that requires mandatory prepayments of term loans as a result of annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Select credit facilities.
At December 31, 2020, Select had outstanding borrowings under the Select credit facilities consisting of a $2,103.4 million Select term loan (excluding unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs of $17.5 million). Select did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Select revolving facility. At December 31, 2020, Select had $410.7 million of availability under the Select revolving facility after giving effect to $39.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. On the last day of each calendar quarter, Select is required to pay each lender a commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the Select revolving facility, which is currently 0.375% per annum and subject to adjustment based on Select’s leverage ratio, as specified in the Select credit agreement.
As of December 31, 2020, Select’s leverage ratio (its ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters), which is required to be maintained at less than 7.00 to 1.00 under the terms of the Select revolving facility, was 3.48 to 1.00.
The Select credit facilities also contain a number of other affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on mergers, consolidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; investments and acquisitions; indebtedness; liens; affiliate transactions; and dividends and restricted payments. The Select credit facilities contain events of default for non-payment of principal and interest when due (subject, as to interest, to a grace period), cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions and an event of default that would be triggered by a change of control.
Select 6.250% senior notes.
At December 31, 2020, Select had $1,225.0 million of 6.250% senior notes outstanding (excluding the unamortized premium and debt issuance costs of $16.8 million).
The terms of the senior notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit Select’s ability and the ability of certain of Select’s subsidiaries to (i) grant liens on its assets, (ii) make dividend payments, other distributions or other restricted payments, (iii) incur restrictions on the ability of Select’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments, (iv) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (v) merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets, (vi) incur additional indebtedness, (vii) make investments, (viii) sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries, (ix) use the proceeds from sales of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries, and (x) enter into transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations and qualifications.
Concentra credit facilities.
At December 31, 2020, Concentra Inc. did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Concentra-JPM revolving facility. At December 31, 2020, Concentra Inc. had $83.6 million of availability under the Concentra-JPM revolving facility after giving effect to $16.4 million of outstanding letters of credit. Concentra Inc. is required to pay each lender a commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the Concentra-JPM revolving facility, which is currently 0.50% per annum and subject to adjustment based on the first lien net leverage ratio, as specified in the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement. Select and Holdings are not obligors with respect to Concentra Inc.’s debt under the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement. At December 31, 2020, Concentra Inc. had outstanding borrowings under the Concentra intercompany loan agreement with Select of $1,133.1 million.
The Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement contains a number of obligations concerning Concentra Inc. In particular, such obligations require Concentra Inc. to maintain a leverage ratio of 5.75 to 1.00 which is tested quarterly, but only if Revolving Exposure (as defined in the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement) exceeds 30% of Revolving Commitments (as defined in the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement) on such day. Failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under the Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement only and, absent a waiver or an amendment from the revolving lenders, preclude Concentra Inc. from making further borrowings under the Concentra-JPM revolving facility and permit the revolving lenders to accelerate all outstanding borrowings under the Concentra-JPM revolving facility. Upon such acceleration, Concentra Inc.’s failure to comply with the financial covenant would result in an event of default with respect to the Concentra intercompany loan agreement.
The Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement also contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on mergers, consolidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; investments and acquisitions; indebtedness; liens; affiliate transactions; and dividends and restricted payments. The Concentra-JPM first lien credit agreement contains events of default for non-payment of principal and interest when due (subject to a grace period for interest), cross-default and cross acceleration provisions and an event of default that would be triggered by a change of control.
The Concentra intercompany loan agreement contains substantially similar obligations, and affirmative and negative covenants.
Liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected certain segments of our operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and liquidity depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time; however, we believe our internally generated cash flows, borrowing capacity under the Select and Concentra-JPM revolving facilities, and other measures taken to enhance our liquidity position have allowed and will continue to allow us to finance our operations in both the short and long term. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $577.1 million, availability of $410.7 million under the Select revolving facility after giving effect to $39.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, and availability of $83.6 million under the Concentra-JPM revolving facility after giving effect to $16.4 million of outstanding letters of credit.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act, which is explained further within “Regulatory Changes,” was enacted. The CARES Act provided additional waivers, reimbursement, grants and other funds to assist health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including $100.0 billion in appropriations for the Provider Relief Fund, to be used for preventing, preparing, and responding to COVID-19, and for reimbursing “eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.” We received approximately $172.6 million of payments under the Provider Relief Fund during the year ended December 31, 2020. We evaluated our compliance with the terms and conditions of the funds and recognized $90.0 million as other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The remaining Provider Relief Fund payments of approximately $82.6 million at December 31, 2020 may need to be repaid to the government to the extent they cannot be utilized in accordance with the regulations promulgated by HHS. In 2021, we have received an additional $34.6 million of payments under the Provider Relief Fund.
In accordance with the CARES Act, CMS expanded its current Accelerated and Advance Payment Program for Medicare providers. Under this program, qualified healthcare providers could receive advanced or accelerated payments from CMS. We received approximately $321.8 million of advanced payments under this program. The majority of these payments were received in April 2020. On October 1, 2020, a short-term government funding bill was signed into law. This bill, among other things, extended the repayment terms for providers who received advanced payments under the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. The bill modified the terms of repayment so that a provider can request no recoupment for one year after the advanced payment was issued, followed by a 25.0% recoupment of Medicare payments during the next 11 months, and 50.0% recoupment of Medicare payments during the last six months. Any amounts that remain unpaid after 29 months would be subject to a 4.0% interest rate. Due to the mechanism in which the advanced payments are repaid, there is uncertainty surrounding when we will repay the advances we received under this program; however, we anticipate that most of the advances will be repaid within the next 12 months.
Additionally, we implemented other temporary measures to reduce operating costs and expenses. Many of these initiatives have been and will continue to be curtailed as we see improvement in patient volumes. These initiatives included reducing labor costs through employee furloughs, salary and wage reductions for certain employees, reducing the hours worked by part time employees, as well as limiting discretionary spending on capital expenditures. We also deferred payment on our share of payroll taxes owed, as allowed by the CARES Act through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company deferred $106.2 million of payroll taxes, half of which is due December 31, 2021, with the remaining half due on December 31, 2022.
At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with each of our financial covenants. As of December 31, 2020, we do not anticipate events or circumstances which would preclude us from complying with our financial covenants in the future or prevent us from making interest and principal payments when due. Our ability to comply with our financial covenants and obligations outlined within our debt agreements can be affected by various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our risk factors discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, may be funded from operating cash flows or other sources and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Stock Repurchase Program. Holdings’ board of directors has authorized a common stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $500.0 million worth of shares of its common stock. The program has been extended until December 31, 2021, and will remain in effect until then, unless further extended or earlier terminated by the board of directors. Stock repurchases under this program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, and at times and in such amounts as Holdings deems appropriate. Holdings funds this program with cash on hand and borrowings under the Select revolving facility. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Holdings repurchased 491,559 shares at a cost of approximately $8.7 million, or $17.68 per share, which includes transaction costs. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2020, Holdings has repurchased 38,580,908 shares at a cost of approximately $356.6 million, or $9.24 per share, which includes transaction costs.
Use of Capital Resources. We may from time to time pursue opportunities to develop new joint venture relationships with large, regional health systems and other healthcare providers. We also intend to open new outpatient rehabilitation clinics and occupational health centers in local areas that we currently serve where we can benefit from existing referral relationships and brand awareness to produce incremental growth. In addition to our development activities, we may grow through opportunistic acquisitions.
Commitments and Contingencies
The following contractual obligation table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods.
_______________________________________________________________________________
(1)See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt and Notes Payable of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
These figures do not reflect the indebtedness owed by Concentra Inc. to Select pursuant to the Concentra intercompany loan agreement in the amount of $1,133.1 million as of December 31, 2020, because such indebtedness is eliminated in consolidation.
(2)The interest obligation for the Select credit facilities was calculated using the average interest rate of 3.2% for the Select term loan at December 31, 2020. The interest obligation for the 6.250% senior notes was calculated using the stated interest rate. The weighted average interest rate of our other debt obligations was 3.9% at December 31, 2020.
(3) Amounts represent purchase commitments that are not presented as construction contract commitments. Our purchase obligations primarily relate to software licensing and support.
(4) See Note 21 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
(5) See Note 6 - Leases of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
(6) Workers’ compensation and professional malpractice liability insurance liabilities of $112.2 million, which are included as components of other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020, have been excluded from the table above as we cannot reasonably estimate the amounts or periods in which these liabilities will be paid.
Concentra Put Right
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Concentra Group Holdings Parent, WCAS and the other members of Concentra Group Holdings Parent and DHHC have Put Rights with respect to their equity interests in Concentra Group Holdings Parent. On January 1, 2020, February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, Select, WCAS and DHHC consummated the Concentra Interest Purchases, which were in lieu of, and collectively deemed to constitute, the exercises of WCAS’ and DHHC’s first and second Put Rights, pursuant to which Select acquired an aggregate amount of approximately 30% of the outstanding membership interests, on a fully diluted basis, of Concentra Group Holdings Parent from WCAS, DHHC and the other equity holders of Concentra Group Holdings Parent, in exchange for an aggregate payment of approximately $576.4 million. Upon consummation of the Concentra Interest Purchases, Select owns in the aggregate approximately 78.0% of the outstanding membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent on a fully diluted basis and approximately 79.8% of the outstanding voting membership interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent.
WCAS and DHHC may exercise their remaining respective Put Rights to sell up to an additional 33 1/3% of the equity interests in Concentra Group Holdings Parent that each, respectively, owned as of February 1, 2018, on an annual basis during the sixty-day period following the delivery of the audited financial statements for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The purchase price of the equity interests is to be based upon a valuation of Concentra Group Holdings Parent performed by an investment bank to be agreed between Select and one of WCAS or DHHC, which valuation will be based on certain precedent transactions using multiples of EBITDA (as defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Concentra Group Holdings Parent) and capped at an agreed upon multiple of EBITDA. Select has the right to elect to pay the purchase price in cash or in shares of Holdings’ common stock. If WCAS exercises its future Put Right, the other members of Concentra Group Holdings Parent, other than DHHC, may elect to sell to Select, on the same terms as WCAS, a percentage of their equity interests of Concentra Group Holdings Parent that such member owned as of February 1, 2018, up to but not exceeding the percentage of equity interests owned by WCAS as of such date that WCAS has determined to sell to Select in the exercise of its Put Right.
Furthermore, WCAS, DHHC, and the other members of Concentra Group Holdings Parent have a put right with respect to their equity interest in Concentra Group Holdings Parent that may only be exercised in the event Holdings or Select experiences a change of control that has not been previously approved by WCAS and DHHC, and which results in change in the senior management of Select (an “SEM COC Put Right”). If an SEM COC Put Right is exercised by WCAS, Select will be obligated to purchase all (but not less than all) of the equity interests of WCAS and the other members of Concentra Group Holdings Parent (other than DHHC) offered by such members at a purchase price based on a valuation of Concentra Group Holdings Parent performed by an investment bank to be agreed between Select and one of WCAS or DHHC, which valuation will be based on certain precedent transactions using multiples of EBITDA and capped at an agreed upon multiple of EBITDA. Similarly, if an SEM COC Put Right is exercised by DHHC, Select will be obligated to purchase all (but not less than all) of the equity interests of DHHC at a purchase price based on a valuation of Concentra Group Holdings Parent performed by an investment bank to be agreed between Select and one of WCAS or DHHC, which valuation will be based on certain precedent transactions using multiples of EBITDA and capped at an agreed upon multiple of EBITDA.
Furthermore, Select has a call right (the “Call Right”), whereby each other member of Concentra Group Holdings Parent will be obligated to sell all or a portion of their equity interests in Concentra Group Holdings Parent to Select at a purchase price based on a valuation of Concentra Group Holdings Parent performed by an investment bank to be mutually agreed upon by Select and either WCAS or DHHC. The valuation will be based on certain precedent transactions using multiples of EBITDA and capped at an agreed upon multiple of EBITDA. Select may first exercise the Call Right after February 1, 2022.
We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to purchase these equity interests in Concentra Group Holdings Parent from the contractual obligations table above because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the Put Right, if exercisable, or the Call Right will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the Put Right or Call Right is exercised; and (iii) the timing and form of consideration of any such payments.
Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare program. We have been, and could be in the future, affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third-party payors to contain healthcare costs by limiting or reducing reimbursement payments.
Additionally, reimbursement payments under governmental and private third-party payor programs may not increase to sufficiently cover increasing costs. Medicare reimbursement in our critical illness recovery hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals is subject to fixed payments under the Medicare prospective payment systems. In accordance with Medicare laws, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payments under what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” Generally, these rates are adjusted for inflation. However, these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services and may be reduced by CMS for other adjustments.
The healthcare industry is labor intensive and the Company’s largest expenses are labor related costs. Wage and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace. There can be no guarantee we will not experience increases in the cost of labor, as the need for clinical healthcare professionals is expected to grow. In addition, suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices. We have little or no ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing services due to federal laws that establish fixed reimbursement rates.
