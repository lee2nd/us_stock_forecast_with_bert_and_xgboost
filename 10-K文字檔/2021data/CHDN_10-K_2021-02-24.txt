On March 25, 2020, as a result of the temporary closures and suspended operations described above, the Company announced the temporary furlough of employees at the Company's wholly-owned and managed gaming properties and certain racing operations. As the Company has reopened these properties, certain employees have returned to work while others remain on temporary furlough due to the capacity restrictions at these properties. The Company provided health, dental, vision and life insurance benefits to furloughed employees through July 31, 2020 and during the subsequent property closure periods.
The Company also implemented a temporary salary reduction for all remaining non-furloughed salaried employees based on a percentage that varies dependent upon the amount of each employee’s salary. The most senior level of executive management received the largest salary decrease, based on both percentage and dollar amount. Salaries for non-furloughed employees resumed at the annual base salary beginning with the start of the employee's first full pay period after July 31, 2020.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") provides an employee retention credit (“CARES Employee Retention Credit”), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes of up to $5,000 per employee for eligible employers.

Approximately $5.3 million of deferred payments are recorded as liabilities within accrued expense and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.
Financial Status and Outlook
The Company reduced planned maintenance and project capital expenditures for 2020 as a result of the temporary property and operations closures and prioritized capital investments based on the highest near-term return opportunities in order to maintain financial flexibility.
Refer to "Credit Facilities and Indebtedness" section within this section for additional detail of the Company's borrowings and repayments under our Credit Facility during 2020.
On April 28, 2020, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which (i) provides for a financial covenant relief period through the date on which the Company delivers the Company's quarterly financial statements and compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, subject to certain exceptions (the “Financial Covenant Relief Period”), (ii) amends the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Credit Agreement with respect to the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for the first two fiscal quarters after the termination of the Financial Covenant Relief Period, (iii) extends certain deadlines and makes certain other amendments to the Company’s financial reporting obligations, (iv) places certain restrictions on restricted payments during the Financial Covenant Relief Period, and (v) amends the definitions of “Material Adverse Effect” and “License Revocation” in the Credit Agreement to take into consideration COVID-19.
During the Financial Covenant Relief Period, the Company will not be required to comply with the consolidated total secured net leverage ratio financial covenant and the interest coverage ratio financial covenant. The Company has agreed to a minimum liquidity financial covenant that requires the Company and restricted subsidiaries to maintain liquidity of at least $150.0 million during the Financial Covenant Relief Period. While the Second Amendment is in effect, the Company agreed to limit Restricted Payments to $26.0 million.
On February 1, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the restricted payments capacity during the Financial Covenant Relief Period, as defined in the Second Amendment, from $26.0 million to $226.0 million to accommodate a share repurchase from an affiliate of The Duchossois Group, Inc. The Company repurchased the shares using available cash and borrowings under the Company's Revolver.
We continue to assess the situation at our properties and operations on a daily basis; however, we are unable to determine when the current restrictions in place for our properties will be removed.
Based on our current projected operating cash flow needs, interest and debt repayments, and revised maintenance and project capital expenditures, we believe we have adequate cash to fund our business operations, meet all of our financial commitments, and invest in our prioritized key growth capital projects for well beyond the next twelve months.
Kater and Thimmegowda Settlement
Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Report for discussion of the settlement agreement with respect to the Kater Litigation and Thimmegowda Litigation the Company entered into during 2020.
Key Indicators to Evaluate Business Results and Financial Condition
Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. These indicators include changes in net revenue, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, outstanding debt balance, operating cash flow and capital spend.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We also use non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Our chief operating decision maker utilizes Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy and allocate resources. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the following:
Adjusted EBITDA includes our portion of EBITDA from our equity investments.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes:
•Transaction expense, net which includes:
-Acquisition and disposition related charges, including fair value adjustments related to earnouts and deferred payments,
-Calder racing exit costs, and
-Other transaction expense, including legal, accounting and other deal-related expense.
•Stock-based compensation expense,
•Midwest Gaming's impact on our investments in unconsolidated affiliates from:
-The impact of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps, and
-Recapitalization and transaction costs.
•Asset impairments,
•Gain on Ocean Downs/Saratoga Transaction,
•Loss on extinguishment of debt,
•Legal reserves,
•Pre-opening expense, and
•Other charges, recoveries and expenses
For segment reporting, Adjusted EBITDA includes intercompany revenue and expense totals that are eliminated in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. See the Reconciliation of Comprehensive (Loss) Income to Adjusted EBITDA included in this section for additional information.
Business Highlights
In 2020, our executive management, leaders, and team members of our Company faced leadership challenges that were unprecedented as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.
The Company reacted quickly to significant threats to the Company's long-term financial health by taking the following actions:
•Property closures and re-openings:
-Implemented immediate employee, customer, and regulatory communications, safety and health protocols, return to work protocols, work-from-home practices and other facility actions to protect our team members, our customers, our communities, and our Company’s assets when governmental authorities ordered the closure and subsequent reopening of nearly all of our properties.
-Furloughed nearly all of our employees at the closed properties during the closure periods and implemented graduated salary reductions based on the level of pay for executive management and all salaried professionals who were not furloughed.
-Executed immediate operational cost reduction actions to offset the loss of revenue.
-Immediately prioritized maintenance and project capital and stopped all non-priority capital projects.
•Negotiated a waiver of our financial covenants for our Credit Agreement while retaining the ability to grow organically, make acquisitions, and pay dividends.
•Made the difficult decision - but one that our investors have applauded as the right decision - to run the Kentucky Oaks and Derby without spectators to protect the long-term value of this iconic asset.
•Consistently communicated with equity and debt investors and rating agencies on an ongoing basis regarding the status of the Company’s operations, financial health, and long-term strategy to provide reassurance on the long-term financial health and strategic direction of the Company.
Churchill Downs Segment:

-The state-of-the-art equine medical center and quarantine barns on the backside area of our track were completed in April 2020 which reinforces our ongoing commitment to equine and jockey safety and supports our long-term international growth strategy. We also implemented other equine safety initiatives led by our on-staff veterinarian including entry restrictions, medication restrictions, and other actions to improve the safety of the equine athletes and jockeys and supported federal legislation that was resulted in the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act being signed into law on December 28, 2020.

Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
•Net revenue decreased $275.7 million driven by a $251.0 million decrease from Gaming due to the temporary suspension of operations of all of our Gaming properties; a $131.4 million decrease from Churchill Downs primarily due to running the 146th Kentucky Oaks and Derby without spectators; and a $11.1 million decrease from All Other primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations at Arlington partially offset by the opening of Oak Grove in September 2020. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $117.8 million increase from Online Wagering due to an increase in handle from higher net revenue per active player and an increase in active players for our TwinSpires Horse Racing business.
•Operating income decreased $155.5 million due to a $109.5 million decrease from Churchill Downs primarily due to running the 146th Kentucky Oaks and Derby without spectators; a $83.3 million decrease from Gaming due to the temporary suspension of operations of all of our Gaming properties; a $17.5 million non-cash impairment of the Presque Isle gaming rights and trademark intangible assets; and a $7.0 million decrease from All Other primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations at Arlington partially offset by the opening of Oak Grove in September 2020.

•Net income from continuing operations decreased $126.3 million. The following items impacted comparability of the Company's net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year: $14.4 million of after-tax expenses incurred in 2019 that did not recur in 2020, including the impact of the accelerated amortization of the purchase and sale agreement rights related to the Turfway Park Acquisition, Midwest Gaming's recapitalization and transaction costs, and legal reserves; a $13.3 million tax benefit related to our net operating loss in the current year that the Company intends to offset prior year taxes as a result of the CARES Act; and a $6.4 million non-cash tax decrease related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on impact of revenue related to states with higher tax rates. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $12.0 million non-cash after-tax impact related to our impairment of the Presque Isle intangible assets; a $1.7 million after-tax increase in expenses related to higher transaction, pre-opening and other expenses; and a $0.2 million increase from other sources. Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations decreased $146.5 million primarily due to a $141.0 million after-tax decrease driven by the results of our operations and equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates and a $5.5 million after-tax increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances.
•Our net income attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated decreased $219.4 million due to a $126.3 million decrease in net income from continuing operations discussed above, a $93.0 million decrease in net loss from discontinued operations, and a $0.1 million decrease in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. During the
second quarter of 2020, we settled the Kater and Thimmegowda litigations for $124.0 million pre-tax ($95.0 million after-tax) which increased our net loss from discontinued operations compared to the prior year period.
•Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $164.9 million driven by a $104.2 million decrease from Gaming due to the temporary suspension of all Gaming property operations; a $99.4 million decrease from Churchill Downs primarily due to running the 146th Kentucky Oaks and Derby without spectators; and a $4.3 million decrease from All Other primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations at Arlington.

•Online Wagering revenue increased $118.3 million from the prior year primarily due to a $114.0 million increase at TwinSpires Horse Racing. Although horse racing content for wagering decreased, TwinSpires Horse Racing handle grew $521.0 million, or 35.8%, compared to prior year, as our customers wagered more on the content that was available. Our TwinSpires Sports and Casino net revenues increased $4.3 million compared to prior year primarily due to the launch of the casino platform in Pennsylvania and Indiana in late December 2019.
•Gaming revenue decreased $250.9 million primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations at all of our Gaming properties that reduced the net revenue generated at these properties.
•All Other revenue decreased $9.5 million primarily due to a $30.8 million decrease as a result of the temporary suspension of operations and loss of racing days at Arlington and a $4.2 million decrease as a result of the temporary
suspension of operations at the majority of United Tote customer locations.

Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Significant items affecting comparability of consolidated operating expense include:
•Taxes and purses decreased $101.4 million driven by the temporary suspension of all operations at our Gaming properties and the related decrease in net revenue and a decrease in purses related to the reduction of horse races from the temporary closures of our facilities, partially offset by an increase in taxes and purses driven by the opening of Oak Grove in September 2020 and Newport in October 2020.
•Content expense increased $41.1 million primarily due to an increase in certain host fees and source market fees for TwinSpires as a result of the increase in handle.
•Salaries and benefits expense decreased $30.7 million driven primarily by temporary furloughing certain employees and temporarily reducing salaries for all remaining non-furloughed salaried employees through the end of July 2020, partially offset by increased expenses due to the opening of Oak Grove in September 2020 and Newport in October 2020.
•Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $7.2 million primarily from a temporary reduction in salaries and associated benefits and a decrease in accrued bonuses compared to prior year.

•Marketing and advertising expense decreased $10.4 million primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations at our brick-and-mortar properties, partially offset by an increase in marketing and advertising spend for TwinSpires Horse Racing and our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business in the Online Wagering segment.

•Other operating expense includes maintenance, utilities, food and beverage costs, property taxes and insurance and other operating expenses. Other operating expense decreased $21.3 million primarily driven by the temporary suspension of operations at our brick-and-mortar properties, partially offset by the operating expenses related to
Turfway Park and from the opening of Oak Grove in September 2020 and Newport Racing and Gaming in October 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA
We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of the results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.

•Churchill Downs Adjusted EBITDA decreased $99.4 million due to a $101.0 million decrease at Churchill Downs Racetrack primarily due to the decrease in net revenue as a result of running the 146th Kentucky Oaks and Derby without spectators, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase from Derby City Gaming due to increased operating efficiencies which more than offset the impact of the temporary closure of the property and ongoing capacity restrictions.
•Online Wagering Adjusted EBITDA increased $43.0 million primarily due to a $48.4 million increase driven by an increase in TwinSpires Horse Racing handle, partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease from a higher level of marketing spend and increased costs associated with the continued build-out of the TwinSpires Sports and Casino business.
•Gaming Adjusted EBITDA decreased $104.2 million driven by an $82.9 million decrease at our wholly-owned Gaming properties and a $21.3 million decrease from our equity investments, both of which were due to decreases in net revenue as a result of the temporary suspension of operations during 2020.
•All Other Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.3 million primarily due to a $7.3 million decrease from lower revenue from Arlington and United Tote, a $1.6 million decrease from higher expenses at Turfway Park as a result of a full year of operations in 2020, and a $0.5 million decrease from other sources. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $5.1 million increase from the opening of Oak Grove in September 2020.

Total liabilities 2,319.3 2,040.0 279.3
Total shareholders’ equity 367.1 511.0 (143.9)
•Total assets increased $135.4 million driven by a $144.8 million increase in property and equipment, net, due to the construction of Oak Grove and Newport; a $34.9 million increase in income taxes receivable as a result of our current year income tax benefit; and a $3.7 million increase in all other assets. Partially offsetting these increases was a $28.8 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily driven by our project capital expenditures related to Oak Grove and Newport; and a $19.2 million decrease in other intangibles primarily due the impairment of Presque Isle gaming rights and trademark.
•Total liabilities increased $279.3 million driven by a $146.5 million increase in long-term debt, non-current, primarily driven by borrowings from our senior secured revolving credit facility; a $124.0 million increase in current liabilities of discontinued operations due to the settlement of Kater and Thimmegowda litigations; and a $12.9 million increase
in accounts payable primarily driven by timing. Partially offsetting these increases was a $4.1 million decrease in all other liabilities.
•Total shareholders’ equity decreased $143.9 million driven by a $81.9 million current year net loss attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated, $27.9 million in repurchases of common stock, $31.4 million in settlement of stock awards, $25.1 million from our annual dividend declared in December 2020, and a $1.3 million decrease in other equity components.

Investing activities (239.4) (781.2) 541.8
Financing activities 76.0 460.8 (384.8)
Included in cash flows from investing activities are capital maintenance expenditures and capital project expenditures. Capital maintenance expenditures relate to the replacement of existing fixed assets with a useful life greater than one year that are obsolete, exhausted, or no longer cost effective to repair. Capital project expenditures represent fixed asset additions related to land or building improvements to new or existing assets or purchases of new (non-replacement) equipment or software related to specific projects deemed necessary expenditures.
Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
•Cash provided by operating activities decreased $147.7 million driven by a $138.0 million decrease in operating income related to continuing operations, net of the $17.5 million non-cash impairment of Presque Isle's intangible assets; a $17.9 million increase in cash interest paid; and a $13.7 million decrease from all other operating activities. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $21.9 million decrease in cash taxes paid. We anticipate that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations and capital expenditures.
•Cash used in investing activities decreased $541.8 million driven by a $648.8 million decrease in cash used for our investment and acquisitions in 2019 related to the equity investment in Midwest Gaming, the Presque Isle Transaction, the Turfway Park Acquisition, and other investments in intangible assets, and a $25.3 million decrease in capital maintenance expenditures. Partially offsetting these decreases were a $128.3 million increase for capital project expenditures and a $4.0 million increase in funds used in other investing activities.
•Cash provided by financing activities decreased $384.8 million driven by a $450.3 million decrease in net borrowings under our long-term debt obligations primarily related to the issuance of our 2027 Senior Notes in 2019, partially offset by borrowings from our senior secured revolving credit facility during 2020, and a $19.8 million increase in cash paid to settle stock awards and pay taxes related to the settlement of stock awards. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $66.6 million decrease in share repurchases in 2020 and an $18.7 million decrease from other financing activities.

Credit Agreement
On December 27, 2017, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the lenders and other financial institutions party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility due 2022 (the "Revolver") and a $400.0 million senior secured term loan B due 2024 (the "Term Loan B"). Included in the maximum borrowing of $700.0 million under the Revolver is a letter of credit sub facility not to exceed $50.0 million and a swing line commitment up to a maximum principal amount of $50.0 million. The Credit Amendment is secured by substantially all wholly-owned assets of the Company. The Company capitalized $1.6 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Revolver which is being amortized as interest expense over 5 years. The Company also capitalized $5.1 million of deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan B portion of the Credit Agreement which is being amortized as interest expense over 7 years.
The interest rates applicable to the Company’s borrowings under the Credit Agreement are LIBOR-based plus a spread, as determined by the Company’s consolidated total net leverage ratio. The Term Loan B requires quarterly payments of 0.25% of the original $400.0 million balance, or $1.0 million per quarter. The Term Loan B may be subject to additional mandatory prepayment from excess cash flow on an annual basis per the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver determined by a pricing grid based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the Company's commitment fee rate was 0.30%.
The Company had an outstanding balance of $149.7 million and had $545.8 million available on the Revolver on December 31, 2020. The Company had $67.4 million of cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2020. On March 16, 2020, we borrowed $675.4 million on the Revolver to provide the Company with additional financial flexibility. On December 31, 2020, we repaid $545.0 million of the borrowings on the Revolver.
On March 16, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment extended the maturity of the Company’s Revolver from December 27, 2022 to at least September 27, 2024, which is 91 days prior to the latest maturity date of the term loan facility on December 27, 2024. The First Amendment also lowered the upper limit of the applied spreads with respect to revolving loans from 2.25% to 1.75% and for commitment fees with respect thereto from 0.35% to 0.30% and provides a reduced pricing schedule for outstanding borrowings and commitment fees with respect to the Revolver across all other leverage pricing levels. The First Amendment did not alter the Company’s borrowing capacity. The Company capitalized $2.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with the First Amendment which are being amortized as interest expense over the remaining duration of the Revolver.
On April 28, 2020, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which (i) provides for a financial covenant relief period through the date on which the Company delivers the Company's quarterly financial statements and compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, subject to certain exceptions (the “Financial Covenant Relief Period”), (ii) amends the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Credit Agreement with respect to the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for the first two fiscal quarters after the termination of the Financial Covenant Relief Period, (iii) extends certain deadlines and makes certain other amendments to the Company’s financial reporting obligations, (iv) places certain restrictions on restricted payments during the Financial Covenant Relief Period, and (v) amends the definitions of “Material Adverse Effect” and “License Revocation” in the Credit Agreement to take into consideration COVID-19.
During the Financial Covenant Relief Period, the Company will not be required to comply with the consolidated total secured net leverage ratio financial covenant and the interest coverage ratio financial covenant. The Company has agreed to a minimum liquidity financial covenant that requires the Company and restricted subsidiaries to maintain liquidity of at least $150.0 million during the Financial Covenant Relief Period. While the Second Amendment is in effect, the Company agreed to limit restricted payments to $26.0 million.
On February 1, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the restricted payments capacity during the Financial Covenant Relief Period, as defined in the Second Amendment, from $26.0 million to $226.0 million to accommodate a share repurchase from an affiliate of The Duchossois Group, Inc. The Company repurchased the shares using available cash and borrowings under the Company's Revolver.
Although the Company was not required to meet the Company's financial covenants under the Credit Agreement on December 31, 2020 (as a result of the Second Amendment), the Company was compliant with all applicable covenants on December 31, 2020.
2027 Senior Notes
On March 25, 2019, we completed an offering of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Unsecured Notes that mature on April 1, 2027 (the "2027 Senior Notes") in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2027 Senior Notes were issued at par, with interest payable on April 1st and October 1st of each year, commencing on October 1, 2019. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay our outstanding balance on the Revolver portion of our Credit Agreement. In connection with the offering, we capitalized $8.9 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2027 Senior Notes.
The 2027 Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated March 25, 2019 (the "2027 Indenture"), among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors (the "2027 Guarantors"), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.

The 2028 Senior Notes were issued at par, with interest payable on January 15th and July 15th of each year, commencing on July 15, 2018. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement to repay the remaining outstanding amount of our $600.0 million 5.375% Senior Unsecured Notes that were scheduled to mature on December 15, 2021. In connection with the offering, we capitalized $7.7 million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2028 Senior Notes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies and recently adopted accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience, contract terms, observance of known trends in our Company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources. Our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those initial estimates.
Our critical accounting estimates relate to goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets
Acquisition of certain identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets
In conjunction with the acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of gaming rights and trademarks. Gaming rights and trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities and use the trademarks indefinitely, and our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming commissions.
We use various valuation methods to determine initial fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the Greenfield method and relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, all of which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The use of these valuation methods requires us to make significant
estimates and assumptions about future revenue and operating expenses, expected start-up costs, capital expenditures, royalty rate, and the discount rate. The fair values of gaming rights are generally determined using the Greenfield method, which is an income approach methodology that calculates the present value based on a projected cash flow stream. This method assumes that the gaming rights provides the opportunity to develop a casino in a specified region, and that the present value of the projected cash flows are a result of the realization of advantages contained in these rights. Under this methodology, the acquirer is expected to absorb all start-up costs, as well as incur all expenses pertaining to the acquisition and/or the creation of all tangible and intangible assets. The estimated future revenue and operating expenses, start-up costs of the acquired business, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The fair values of trademarks are generally determined using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the intangible asset by discounting the fair value of the hypothetical royalty payments a market participant would be willing to pay to enjoy the benefits of the trademarks. The estimated future revenue, royalty rate, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are generally derived from the weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted for the size and/or risk of the asset.
Assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
We perform our annual review for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on April 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. Adverse industry or economic trends, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization, among other items, may be indications of potential impairment issues which are triggering events requiring the testing of an asset’s carrying value for recoverability.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to complete the impairment test using a more likely than not criteria. If an entity believes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, the quantitative impairment test can be bypassed. Alternatively, an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. If a quantitative impairment test of goodwill is required, we generally determine the fair value under the market and income valuation approaches using inputs primarily related to discounted projected cash flows and price multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. If a quantitative impairment test of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is required, we generally determine the fair value using the Greenfield method for gaming rights and relief-from-royalty method of the income approach for trademarks. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, among others. These factors require significant judgments and estimates, and application of alternative assumptions could produce materially different results. Evaluations of possible impairment require us to estimate, among other factors, forecasts of future operating results, revenue growth, operating expense, tax rates, start-up costs, capital expenditures, depreciation, working capital, discount rates, long-term growth rates, risk premiums, royalty rates, terminal values, and fair values of our reporting units and assets. The impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to uncertainties arising from such events as changes in competitive conditions, the current economic environment, material changes in growth rate assumptions that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future operating conditions and cash flows, changes in the discount rate, and the impact of strategic decisions. If any of these factors were to materially change, such change may require a reevaluation of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
