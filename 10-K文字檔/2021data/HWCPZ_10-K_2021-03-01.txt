ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes and events in the financial condition and results of operations of Hancock Whitney Corporation and subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2020 and selected prior periods. This discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement financial and operating data and information presented elsewhere in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report.
We have elected to early adopt the provisions of the new Subpart 229.1400 of Regulation S-K, “Disclosures by Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants” that updates and codifies certain requirements of Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosures for Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants. The adoption of these provision did not have material impact to our disclosures and are incorporated throughout the following content.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include non-GAAP measures used to describe our performance. A reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures are provided in Item 6. “Selected Financial Data.” The following is an overview of the non-GAAP measures used and the reasons why management believes they are useful and important in understanding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are included below.
Consistent with the provisions of Subpart 229.1400 of Regulation S-K, “Disclosures by Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants,” we present net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratios on a fully taxable equivalent (“te”) basis. The te basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of interest income from certain loans and investments using the statutory federal tax rate (21% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, and 35% for all other periods presented) to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. This measure is the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
We present certain additional non-GAAP financial measures to assist the reader with a better understanding of the Company’s performance period over period, as well as to provide investors with assistance in understanding the success management has experienced in executing its strategic initiatives. We use the term “operating” to describe a financial measure that excludes income or expense considered to be nonoperating in nature. Items identified as nonoperating are those that, when excluded from a reported financial measure, provide management or the reader with a measure that may be more indicative of forward-looking trends in the Company’s business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results or capital position under U.S. GAAP.
We define Operating Revenue as net interest income (te) and noninterest income less nonoperating revenue. We define Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue as operating revenue (te) less noninterest expense, excluding nonoperating items. Management believes that operating pre-provision net revenue is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
For our company and countless others, 2020 was an eventful year. We dealt with the pandemic and the resultant broad impact to the economy, our communities and our operations; executed a balance sheet de-risking strategy; built credit reserves; and continued to meet the financial needs of our customers with unwavering teamwork, commitment to service and strength during stressful times. At December 31, 2020, assets totaled $33.6 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year, with loans of $21.8 billion and deposits totaling $27.7 billion. Capital remained well above regulatory minimums, including the conservation buffer, and our liquidity position remains strong with more than $1.3 billion in short-term investments and approximately $17.5 billion of net availability from internal and external sources at December 31, 2020.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by a highly-contagious novel coronavirus, continues to be a global public health crisis. In March 2020, following the World Health Organization’s declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, efforts to contain the spread of the virus in the United States in the form of stay at home orders and/or heavy restrictions on travel, entertainment, trade and retail operations triggered an abrupt, sharp decline in commercial and consumer activity. Nearly a year later, the virus is not yet contained, and disruption of global financial markets continues. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume.
The federal government has introduced various measures to provide temporary economic aid to individuals and businesses financially impacted by COVID-19. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percent. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, provided, among many other forms of fiscal and regulatory relief, enhanced unemployment benefits, direct payments to qualifying individuals, and forgivable loans to qualifying businesses under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The December 2020 passage of The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a major government funding bill, provides for additional monetary stimulus to qualifying individuals and supplemental PPP loan opportunities to qualifying business entities.
In addition to fiscal stimulus, the federal government’s public-private partnership, Operation Warp Speed, was established in May 2020 to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. In December 2020, two varieties of a vaccine were given authorization for use in the United States. At present, access to either of these vaccines is largely limited to healthcare and other essential workers and individuals meeting certain age and/or health-related criteria.
Economic conditions showed meaningful signs of recovery during the latter half of 2020. After peaking at 14.8% in April, the rate of unemployment declined to 6.7% in December, and Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed gains, on an annualized basis, of 33% and 4% in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively, after falling precipitously in the second quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the fourth quarter 2020 growth in GDP reflected both the continued economic recovery from the sharp declines earlier in the year and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including new restrictions and closures that took effect in some areas of the United States. The success of government initiatives in stimulating economic activity, societal response to virus containment measures, and the availability and efficacy of vaccines that will meaningfully reduce infection rates are critical to the resolution of the crisis.
Impact to Our Business
As a financial institution, our business has been deeply impacted by the economic and social turmoil brought on by the pandemic. Our response at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis was proactive and continues to be adaptive to changing conditions. We modified certain business practices, such as the temporary conversion of financial centers to drive-through and appointment only service and remote work for many of our associates to protect the health and wellbeing of our communities and to comply with guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control, while maintaining continuous five-star service. At present, our financial centers are operating at full service, and the majority of our associates have returned to on-site work. We have instituted social distancing measures, enhanced sanitation routines, and continue to offer remote work options, where available and prudent. We have taken deliberate measures to maintain a strong liquidity position and enhance capital levels, control both interest and noninterest expense, and built an allowance for credit losses that we believe to be appropriate in light of current and forecasted economic conditions. We have participated in various economic relief strategies, including the origination of more than 13,000 PPP loans in 2020 totaling $2.4 billion, providing monetary and in-kind donations to various COVID relief efforts, and offered temporary waivers of certain service fees, short-term deferrals of principal and/or interest on loan payments, as well as other modifications to loan repayment terms for customers financially affected by COVID-19.
The PPP loans provided loan growth and contributed favorably to our net interest income and margin in the current interest rate environment, while delivering much needed assistance in the communities we serve. In addition, the low interest rate environment spurred activity in secondary mortgage market operations, contributing favorably to noninterest income.
However, the dramatic slowdown in economic activity has and is expected to continue to mute the demand for most other forms of commercial and consumer loan products in the near term. The lack of new loan demand, coupled with the significant increase in deposit liabilities attributable to the influx of customers’ government stimulus funds and PPP loan proceeds and the effect of decreased consumer and business spending, has resulted in liquidity in excess of current need and, in turn, contraction of our net interest margin. Declines in consumer and business spending, particularly in the early part of 2020, have also driven decreases in activity-based fees, such as bank card and ATM fees, and higher average balances in customer deposits accounts have resulted in decreases in overdraft and certain other account fees. Furthermore, a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in geographic areas and/or business sectors that have been disproportionately impacted by restrictions on movement, such as hospitality, retail and nonessential healthcare services. We continue to monitor these loans closely.
To mitigate the effects of these factors, we have enacted strategies and initiated certain measures to remove risk from our balance sheet, enhance our available liquidity and capital positions, and improve overall efficiency. During the first half of 2020, we divested a significant portion of our energy loan portfolio and issued $172.5 million of subordinated debt, which is included in our Tier 2 capital. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $603 million in provision for credit losses, which represents both the credit losses associated with the divestiture of energy loans and building of reserves for credit losses that aligns with current and forecasted economic conditions. Further, we closed or announced the closure of 20 financial centers, closed two trust and asset management offices in the northeast, and have made other reductions in our workforce through attrition and other means. We have
also recently announced a voluntary early retirement program through our well-funded pension plan. We believe these measures have and will continue to lead to improved returns for our shareholders.
Economic Outlook
We utilize economic forecasts produced by Moody’s Analytics (Moody’s) that provide various scenarios to assist in the development of our economic outlook. These forecasts are anchored on a baseline forecast scenario, which Moody’s defines as the “most likely outcome,” based on current condition, of where the economy is headed. Several upside and downside scenarios are produced that are derived from the baseline scenario. This outlook discussion utilizes the December 2020 Moody’s forecast, the most current available at December 31, 2020, however, our economic outlook has not changed materially from year-end. In the December 2020 baseline forecast, the near-term economic recovery was assumed to be somewhat faster compared to the assumption included the September forecast, but with growth muted until vaccines are widely available. Key underlying assumptions in the baseline forecast are that (1) there will be no widespread economic shutdown, (2) vaccines will be made widely available by February 2021, resulting in infections abating by September 2021, (3) unemployment rates averaging 8.1% in 2020, 6.9% in 2021, and 6.0% in 2022, (4) change in gross domestic product averages of -3.5% in 2020, 4.1% in 2021, and 4.7%, a return to the pre-pandemic level, in 2022, (5) the next round of fiscal stimulus would be smaller than previously expected and therefore less impactful, and (6) the Federal Reserve will continue to respond to the economic damage by maintaining rates at or near zero until late 2023.
The alternative Moody’s forecast scenarios have varying degrees of positive and negative severity of the outcome of the economic downturn, as well as varying shapes and length of recovery. Management determined that assumptions provided for in the downside slower near-term growth and recessionary scenarios (S-2 and S-3, respectively) were reasonably possible, and as such, the S-2 and S-3 scenarios were given consideration through probability weighting in our allowance for credit losses calculation at December 31, 2020. We believe these alternative scenarios are less likely to occur than the Baseline and have weighted them accordingly in developing our economic forecast. The extent to which observed and forecasted economic conditions deteriorate or recover beyond that currently forecasted may result in additional volatility and allowance for credit loss builds or releases in the future. Changes in the depth and duration of these economic conditions may also require revisions to our currently forecasted cash flows that could result in impairment of certain intangible or other assets in future periods.
Given the above economic forecast, we expect to continue to have pressure on loan demand and earnings in the near term, the extent of which is difficult to estimate. In the latter half of 2020, we have seen improved customer activity and revenue levels that we expect to continue into 2021. We have implemented several strategies to try to effectively manage our asset/liability mix to manage our resources and reduce costs until the economy returns to a more normalized level of activity in our region. The timing of such return pre-pandemic activity in our region remains uncertain.
Overview of 2020 Financial Results
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $45.2 million, or $(0.54) per common share, compared to net income of $327.4 million in 2019, or $3.72 per diluted common share. Following is an overview of financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020:
•
Net loss of $45.2 million included $160.1 million of provision for credit losses attributable to the sale of a substantial portion of the energy loan portfolio, described below, and $442.8 million of provision for credit losses that was largely attributable to borrowers financially impacted by COVID-19
•
Operating pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) was $491.2 million, up $3 million compared to 2019, with an increase in total revenue (te) of $54 million, partially offset by an increase in operating expense of $51 million
•
Net interest margin was 3.27%, a decrease of 17 basis points (bps) from 2019, as a result of both the sharp contraction in interest rates in response to economic disruption, and a changing asset/liability portfolio mix
•
Net operating loss carryback provisions included in the CARES Act contributed to additional tax benefits in 2020, with a total net income tax benefit of $79.6 million for the year
•
Loans totaled $21.8 billion, up $0.6 billion from December 31, 2019, which includes PPP loans of $2.0 billion
•
Criticized commercial loans declined $188 million, or 32%, and total nonperforming loans declined by $163 million, or 53%, from December 31, 2019, reflecting the sale of a significant portion of our energy portfolio
•
Total assets at December 31, 2020 were $33.6 billion, up $3.0 billion, or 10%, from December 31, 2019
•
Deposits of $27.7 billion at December 31, 2020, increased $3.9 billion, or 16%, compared to the prior to year; noninterest bearing deposits comprised 44% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, compared to 37% for the prior year end
•
Capital ratios remain strong and well above regulatory minimums, with common equity tier 1 equity (“CET1”) of 10.61% at December 31, 2020, compared to 10.50% at December 31, 2019. Dividends were maintained throughout 2020
As noted above, during the third quarter of 2020, we closed the sale of $497 million of energy loans, including reserve based lending, midstream and nondrilling service credits, and received net proceeds of approximately $254.4 million. The primary objective of the sale was to remove risk in our loan portfolio by accelerating the disposition of assets that were impacted by ongoing issues in the energy industry, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. As a result of this transaction, our credit quality metrics have improved year-over-year, despite the current economic environment.
Our 2020 results reflect both the continued focus on de-risking the balance sheet in light of today’s economic environment, including the energy loan sale, and the building of credit reserves for the expected impact to our economies related to the pandemic. Despite those charges, our pre-provision net revenue improved and our capital remains solid. We expect that our actions should lead to better returns for our shareholders and look forward to improved performance in 2021.
The overactive hurricane season in 2020 impacted several of our Gulf Coast markets, including Southwest and Southeast Louisiana, Coastal Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, with four powerful hurricanes making landfall. After each event, we quickly mobilized portable banking units and ATMs to affected areas, and most locations reopened under generator power the following day. We continue to support our clients, communities and our colleagues in these areas. While we had some damage to facilities, we do not expect significant financial impact from any of the storms, including no material provision for credit losses.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion of results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Refer to previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion of prior year variances.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $942.5 million, up $47.3 million from $895.2 million in 2019. Net interest income is the primary component of our earnings and represents the difference, or spread, between revenue generated from interest-earning assets and the interest expense related to funding those assets. For analytical purposes, net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis (te) using the statutory federal tax rate of 21% on tax exempt items (primarily interest on municipal securities and loans).
Net interest income (te) for 2020 totaled $955.5 million, a $45.5 million, or 5%, increase from 2019. The increase in net interest income in 2020 was primarily due to a $2.8 billion increase in average earning assets driven by the origination of approximately $2.4 billion of PPP loans during the second and third quarters of 2020, and the acquisition of Midsouth in September of 2019. The growth in earnings assets was primarily funded by a $2.5 billion increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits. This deposit growth is attributable to a combination of customers’ government stimulus funds and PPP loan proceeds, and a reduced level of consumer and business spending. Also funding the earning asset growth was the proceeds of the Company’s $172.5 million subordinated debt issuance during the second quarter of 2020. Partially offsetting the net interest income increase from average earning asset growth was a 65 bp decrease in the yield on earning assets compared to a 48 bp reduction in the Company’s cost of funds.
The yield on earning assets was 3.66% in 2020, down 65 bps from 2019. The decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of the lower interest rate environment on the loan and investment portfolios, a $7.8 million reduction in purchase accounting accretion and a less favorable earning asset mix driven by liquidity in excess of current needs. The excess liquidity resulted in a higher percentage of assets invested in lower yielding overnight funds. Loan yields were down 68 bps to 4.13% as the low rate environment resulted in the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio repricing downward as their corresponding index rates, primarily LIBOR and Treasury rates, decreased, with many facilities reaching their floors. Also impacted by the low rate environment were the yields on new loans, which were originated at yields lower than portfolio averages. The taxable equivalent yield on investment securities decreased 24 bps in 2020 to 2.38% as higher yielding fixed rate securities paid down and were replaced by securities purchased at lower yields in the current environment.
The cost of funds decreased 48 bps to 0.39% in 2020, from 0.87% in 2019, primarily as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average interest-bearing deposit costs decreased from 125 bps in 2019 to 57 bps in 2020. The excess liquidity noted above allowed us to reduce the balance of higher costing brokered deposits while aggressively pricing downward interest-bearing transaction accounts and time deposits by reducing promotional rates. Other short-term borrowing costs decreased 136 bps to .62% in 2020 due to the decrease in the overall interest rate environment. Our other short-term borrowings consist largely of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and our 2020 outstandings were either variable rate or lower fixed-rate advances entered into in late 2019 and early 2020. The cost of long-term debt increased 49 bps to 5.36% from the June 2020 issuance of $172.5 million in subordinated debt at 6.25%.
The net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income (te) to average earning assets. The net interest margin decreased 17 bps to 3.27% in 2020 from 3.44% in 2019, due primarily to the reasons noted above. Discussions of Asset/Liability Management and Net Interest Income at Risk later in this item provide additional information regarding our management of interest rate risk and the potential impact from changes in interest rates, respectively.
We anticipate net interest margin to compress as much as 10 bps in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 level of 3.22%, due largely to high levels of excess liquidity, partially offset by our continued focus on reducing deposit costs. We expect similar levels of activity within our PPP loans, with forgiveness of existing loans largely matching originations of new loans, however, the timing of the activity could impact our results.

Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses was $602.9 million in 2020, compared to $47.7 million in 2019. The 2020 provision includes net charge-offs of $394.8 million, or 1.78% of average loans outstanding, and a $209.5 million build in the allowance for funded loan losses partially offset by a $1.4 million release of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The significant increase from 2019 is primarily attributable to the impact of the widespread economic disruption from the pandemic on our estimate of expected lifetime credit losses and an additional $160.1 million provision related to the energy loan sale, which significantly reduced our exposure in that sector. The 2019 provision included net charge-offs of $47.0 million, or 0.23% of average loans outstanding, and a $4.0 million reserve build for unfunded lending commitments, partially offset by a $3.3 million release of the allowance for funded loan losses.
As noted above, net charge offs totaled $394.8 million, an increase of $347.8 million from 2019. Net charge offs in 2020 included $242.6 million in net charges offs related to the energy loan sale, an additional $65.8 million related to the energy portfolio, $51.6 million related to healthcare credits, $24.3 million of other commercial charges, $11.6 million of consumer charges and a net recovery of $1.1 million in residential mortgage. Substantially all of the 2020 nonenergy commercial charges were existing problem credits that were further financially impacted by the pandemic. Net charge offs in 2019 of $47.0 million included $10.1 million in energy related charge-offs, a $9.0 million fraud-related charge on a lease facility and $12.7 million of other commercial charges, as well as $14.8 million and $0.4 million in consumer and residential charge-offs, respectively.
For the first quarter of 2021, we expect a provision for credit losses in the range of $10 million to $15 million, which could be lower depending on non-PPP loan growth and other factors. We also expect that net charge-offs could exceed provision expense.
Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Balance Sheet Analysis-Allowance for Credit Losses” provides additional information on changes in the allowance for credit losses and general credit quality.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income for 2020 totaled $324.4 million, an $8.5 million, or 3%, increase from 2019. The increase is largely due to higher income from secondary mortgage operations that benefited from the decrease in interest rates that created a favorable rate environment for home mortgage origination and refinancing. Other increases included income from bank owned life insurance and bank card and ATM fees, with lower revenue from service charges on deposit, trust fees, and investment and annuity fees and insurance commissions.
Table 3 presents, for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the components of noninterest income, along with the percentage changes between years.
TABLE 3. Noninterest Income
Service charges are comprised of overdraft and insufficient funds fees, consumer, business and corporate analysis service charges, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related charges. Service charges on deposit accounts were down $9.7 million, or 11%, from 2019, attributable to a number of factors. We temporarily offered waivers of certain account service fees to provide relief to customers impacted by the pandemic. Further, higher average customer account balances that were driven by the pandemic-related decrease in spending and inflows from stimulus payments and PPP loan proceeds resulted in lower overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees.
Trust fee income represents revenue generated from asset management services provided to individuals, businesses and institutions. Trust fees totaled $58.2 million in 2020, a $3.4 million, or 6%, decrease from 2019. The decrease in trust fees is primarily due to the volatile market conditions in 2020 caused by the pandemic. Trust assets under management totaled $9.4 billion at December 31, 2019, decreased to $8.3 billion at March 31, 2020, and increased to $8.8 billion at June 30, 2020, $9.0 billion at September 30, 2020 and ended the year at $9.5 billion.
Bank card and ATM fees include interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions, fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, and fees earned from ATM transactions. Bank card and ATM fees totaled $68.1 million in 2020, up $1.2 million, or 2%, compared to 2019. The growth over 2019 is the result of increased debit card activity during 2020, due in part to increased accounts from the MidSouth acquisition late in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the decline in transaction activity from decreased spending during the economic shutdown in the first half of the year caused by the pandemic. While these fees increased in the latter half of 2020, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Investment and annuity fees and insurance commissions totaled $24.3 million in 2020, compared to $26.6 million in 2019. The $2.2 million, or 8%, decrease is primarily due to decreased investment and annuity sales, and insurance fees. This business line was impacted by pandemic-related disruption of financial center operations and market volatility.
Income from secondary mortgage market operations is comprised of income produced from the origination and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We offer a full range of mortgage products to our customers and typically sell longer-term fixed rate loans while retaining the majority of adjustable rate loans, as well as loans generated through programs to support customer relationships. Income from secondary mortgage operations totaled $40.2 million in 2020, up $20.4 million, or 103%, from a year earlier. Mortgage loan production increased by approximately 64% in 2020 compared to 2019, and the percentage of loan production sold in the secondary market increased 104%. To the extent low interest rates persist, mortgage loan production may remain elevated in the near term, but is not expected to be maintained at the levels that were experienced in 2020.
Income from bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) is generated through insurance benefit proceeds as well as the growth of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held. BOLI income increased $3.2 million, or 22%, to $18.2 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase in benefit proceeds, which were up $3.9 million from 2019.
Income from derivatives is largely from our customer interest rate derivative program, and totaled $12.8 million in 2020, compared to $13.0 million in 2019. The decline in income was largely due to a negative valuation adjustment on a company owned derivative and lower interest earned on derivative collateral, largely offset by higher customer derivative income with increased fees from added volume. Derivative income can be volatile and is dependent upon the composition of the portfolio, customer sales activity and market value adjustments due to market interest rate movement.
Other miscellaneous income is comprised of various items, including income from small business investment companies, FHLB stock dividends, and syndication fees. Other miscellaneous income was $13.2 million in 2020, down $1.5 million, or 10%, compared to 2019. The decrease from the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in income from small business investment companies and lower FHLB stock dividends, partially offset by a $1.5 million gain on the sale of historic tax credits in the first quarter of 2020.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense for 2020 totaled $788.8 million, up $18.1 million, or 2%, compared to 2019. There were no nonoperating expenses in 2020 and there were $32.7 million in 2019 related to the acquisition and operational integration of MidSouth. Items identified as nonoperating are those that, when excluded from a reported financial measure, provide management or the reader with a measure that may be more indicative of forward-looking trends in our business. Noninterest expense excluding nonoperating items increased $50.8 million, or 7%. The largest individual components of the increase in operating expense were personnel expense, due in part to an increase of associates from the MidSouth acquisition in September of 2019 and other real estate and foreclosed assets expense due to write-downs. Explanations of the variances are discussed below in more detail.
Table 4 presents, for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, noninterest expense, along with the percentage changes between years. Table 5 presents nonoperating expense included in noninterest expense (Table 4) by component for the same periods.
TABLE 4. Noninterest Expense
TABLE 5. Nonoperating Expense
Personnel expense consists of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance. Total personnel expense was up $24.2 million, or 5%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the merger-related nonoperating personnel expense in 2019, our employee costs were up $31.7 million or 7%. Personnel expense in 2020 increased due to increased headcount for much of the year, due in part to addition of MidSouth associates, merit raises, overtime and incentives related to a higher volume of mortgage originations, overtime expense incurred in the implementation of the PPP lending program, and other support costs in response to the pandemic.
Occupancy and equipment expenses are primarily composed of lease expenses, depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other equipment expenses. Total occupancy and equipment expenses increased $2.5 million, or 4%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding nonoperating merger-related expense, occupancy and equipment expense increased $3.9 million, or 6%. This increase was primarily due to increased cost from the MidSouth facilities and additional facility cleaning and sanitation costs related to the pandemic.
Data processing expense includes expenses related to third party technology processing and servicing costs, technology project costs and fees associated with bank card and ATM transactions. Data processing expense in 2020 was up $4.8 million, or 6%, from 2019, and up $5.9 million, or 7%, when excluding nonoperating merger related costs. The increase is primarily related to costs associated with new technology investments and higher card transaction processing costs resulting from increased card activity and expenses related to MidSouth.
Professional services expense increased $4.5 million, or 10%, from 2019. Excluding the $7.1 million of merger-related expenses in 2019, professional services expense increased $11.6 million, or 31%, primarily due to consulting and other professional fees related to serivcing of the PPP lending program and an increase in legal and accounting costs.
Amortization of intangibles in 2020 totaled $19.9 million, a $0.9 million, or 4%, decrease from 2019 as a result of the accelerated amortization methods used.
Deposit insurance and regulatory fees decreased $0.7 million, or 4%, from 2019 mainly due to a reduction in the risk-based deposit insurance assessment fees that were favorably impacted by our liquidity position and improved asset quality metrics, largely attributable to the sale of energy loans.
Other real estate and foreclosed asset expense was $9.6 million in 2020, compared to $0.7 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 is due to a $9.8 million write-down of equity interests in two energy-related companies received in borrower bankruptcy restructurings.
Business development-related expenses (including advertising, travel, entertainment and contributions) were down $6.1 million, or 20%, from 2019. Prior year included approximately $2.6 million of merger-related advertising cost. The remaining decline was due to lower expenses in 2020 due to the pandemic, primarily in travel.
Corporate value and franchise taxes were up $0.6 million, or 4%, to $16.6 million in 2020, largely due to higher excise taxes associated with terminating select life insurance policies.
Noninterest expense in both 2020 and 2019 was reduced by a net credit in other retirement expense. The net credit was $8.6 million, or 52%, higher in 2020, based on better performance of pension plan assets.
All other expenses decreased $11.1 million, or 18%, from 2019 primarily due to $12.8 million of nonoperating costs incurred in 2019 related to the acquisition of MidSouth.
Our focus on expense control was enhanced in light of the current economic environment and we have initiatives in place to improve overall efficiency. In the latter half of 2020, we closed or announced closure of 20 financial offices, closed the two trust offices in the northeast corridor, and reduced our full time equivalent headcount by 210 since June 30, 2020. In addition, in the first quarter of 2021, we announced a voluntary early retirement package for certain associates. Excluding nonrecurring charges for certain initiatives such as early retirement, we expect first quarter 2021 expenses to be flat compared to our improved fourth quarter 2020 level of $193 million, as our efficiency initiatives continue to offset typical beginning of the year increases, with additional improvement further into 2021 as the benefit of the initiatives are fully realized.
Income Taxes
We recorded income tax benefit at an effective rate of 63.8% in 2020, compared to income tax expense at an effective rate of 16.6% in 2019. The comparability of the effective tax rate between 2020 and 2019 is impacted by the pre-tax loss year in 2020. In addition, the CARES Act allows taxpayers to carry back net operating losses (“NOL”) generated in tax years prior to January 1, 2021 five years to a 35% statutory tax rate year, which created additional tax benefits due to the 14% tax rate differential. The combination of the NOL carryback of our 2020 tax loss and the NOL attribute carryback from a previously acquired entity generated a net tax benefit of approximately $30.2 million. Our NOL was predominantly driven by the loss incurred on the energy loan sale that closed in the third quarter of 2020 and by tax method changes and/or elections associated with the timing of income recognition and fixed asset related depreciation deductions. One of the tax method changes requires approval from the Internal Revenue Service, which we expect to receive.
We expect the effective tax rate to return to a quarterly range of approximately 18% to 20% for 2021, absent any changes in tax laws.
Our effective tax rate has historically varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to tax-exempt income and tax credits. Interest income on bonds issued by or loans to state and municipal governments and authorities, and earnings from the life insurance contract program are the major components of tax-exempt income.
Table 6 reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
TABLE 6. Income Taxes
The main source of tax credits has been investments in tax-advantage securities and tax credit projects. These investments are made primarily in the markets we serve and directed at tax credits issued under the Federal and State New Market Tax Credit (“NMTC”), Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) and pre-2018 Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (“QZAB”) and Qualified School Construction Bonds (“QSCB”) programs. The investments generate tax credits which reduce current and future taxes and are recognized when earned as a benefit in the provision for income taxes. Additionally, the amortization of the LIHTC investment cost will be recognized as a component of income tax expense in proportion to the tax credits recognized over the 10-year credit period of each project.
We have invested in NMTC projects through investments in our own CDEs, as well as other unrelated CDEs. Federal tax credits from NMTC investments are recognized over a seven-year period, while recognition of the benefits from state tax credits varies from three to five years.
Based only on tax credit investments that have been made through 2020, we expect to realize benefits from federal and state tax credits over the next three years totaling $7.8 million, $8.6 million and $8.5 million for 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. We intend to continue making investments in tax credit projects. However, our ability to access new credits will depend upon, among other factors, federal and state tax policies and the level of competition for such credits.
At December 31, 2020, we had a net deferred tax liability of $49 million, which is comprised of $216 million of deferred tax liabilities offset against $167 million in deferred tax assets (net of state valuation allowance). Several factors are considered in determining the recoverability of the deferred tax asset components, such as the history of taxable earnings, reversal of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on our review of these factors, we have established a $3.6 million valuation allowance for state net operating losses.
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Investment Securities
Our investment in securities was $7.4 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The investment securities portfolio is managed by ALCO to assist in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity while providing an acceptable rate of return. At December 31, 2020, the amortized cost of securities available for sale totaled $5.8 billion and securities held to maturity totaled $1.4 billion, compared to $4.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019.
Our securities portfolio consists mainly of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage-backed securities that are issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. We invest only in high quality investment grade securities and manage the investment portfolio duration generally between two and five and a half years. At December 31, 2020, the average expected maturity of the portfolio was 5.70 years with an effective duration of 4.14 years and a nominal weighted-average yield of 2.07%. Management simulations indicate that the effective duration would increase to 4.37 years with a 100 bp increase in the yield curve and increase to 4.53 years with a 200 bp increase. At December 31, 2019, the average expected maturity of the portfolio was 5.47 years with an effective duration of 4.16 years and a nominal weighted-average yield of 2.49%. The change in expected maturity, effective duration, and nominal weighted-average yield is primarily related to reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flow and growth during 2020.
During 2020, we invested approximately $730 million in fixed rate commercial mortgage backed securities and simultaneously entered into last-of-layer swaps on these assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.2 billion in notional amount of forward-starting fixed payer swaps that convert the latter portion of the term of certain available for sale securities to a floating rate. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk. This strategy provides the Company with a fixed rate coupon during the front-end unhedged tenor of the bonds and results in a floating rate security during the back-end hedged tenor.
Effective January 1, 2020 and in conjunction with the adoption of CECL, and again in each quarter of 2020, the Company evaluated its securities portfolio for credit losses. Based on our assessments, expected credit loss was negligible and therefore, no allowance for credit loss was recorded during any reporting period in 2020.
There were no investments in securities of a single issuer, other than U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that exceeded 10% of stockholders’ equity. We do not invest in subprime or “Alt A” home mortgage-backed securities. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value, while held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale securities are excluded from net income and are recognized, net of tax, in other comprehensive income and in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
The following table presents debt securities by type at December 31, 2020:
TABLE 7. Debt Securities by Type
The amortized cost, fair value and yield of debt securities at December 31, 2020, by final contractual maturity, are presented in the table below. Securities are classified according to their final contractual maturities without consideration of scheduled and unscheduled principal amortization, potential prepayments or call options. Accordingly, actual maturities will differ from their reported contractual maturities. The expected average maturity years presented in the tables includes scheduled principal payments and assumptions for prepayments.
TABLE 8. Debt Securities Maturities by Type
Loan Portfolio
Total loans at December 31, 2020 were $21.8 billion, compared to $21.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The $0.6 billion, or 3%, increase is primarily attributable to PPP loan originations, partially offset by the sale of a portion of the energy loan portfolio, organic contraction due to a decrease in demand across our footprint, and PPP loan forgiveness.
The composition of our loan portfolio was as follows:
TABLE 9. Loans Outstanding by Type
The commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loan portfolio includes both commercial non-real estate and commercial real estate - owner occupied loans. C&I loans totaled $12.8 billion, or 59% of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.9 billion from December 31, 2019. The net growth is largely attributable to PPP loan originations of $2.4 billion, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness, the energy loan sale and organic contraction due to lower demand throughout our footprint. C&I loans, excluding PPP loans, totaled $10.8 billion, or 50% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.
Our commercial and industrial customer base is diversified over a range of industries, including wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products, financial and professional services, healthcare services, energy, marine transportation and maritime construction, and agricultural production. We lend mainly to middle-market and smaller commercial entities, although we do participate in larger shared-credit loan facilities with businesses well known to the relationship officers and generally operating in our market areas. Shared national credits funded at December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $1.7 billion, or 8% of total loans. Approximately $301 million of our shared national credits at December 31, 2020 were with health care related borrowers.
Loans to borrowers in the energy sector totaled $308 million at December 31, 2020, down $656 million compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to the July 2020 sale of $497 million of energy loans to reduce our exposure to this segment, as well as charge-offs and paydowns during the year. At December 31, 2020, substantially all of the energy portfolio was comprised of customers engaged in onshore and offshore services and products to support exploration and production activities, with approximately 70% of the balances in increments of $10 million or less.
The following table provides detail of the more significant industry concentrations for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which is based on NAICS codes for all industries, with the exceptions of energy, which is based on the borrower’s source of revenue (i.e. manufacturer whose income is derived from energy-related business is reported as energy), and PPP loans, as those are expected to be 100% SBA guaranteed and therefore have limited credit risk. There is approximately $2 million of energy-related loans included in the real estate secured table that follows.
TABLE 10. Commercial & Industrial Loans by Industry Concentration
Commercial real estate - income producing loans totaled $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $363 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2019. The increase reflects construction loans converting to permanent financing, as well as organic growth. The increase was partially offset by approximately $561 million in paydowns.
Construction and land development loans totaled approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $92 million, or 8%. The decrease was primarily due to construction and land development loans converting to permanent financing, and lower demand across our footprint.
The following table details the end-of-period aggregated commercial real estate - income producing and construction loan balances by property type. Loans reflected in 1-4 Family Residential Construction include both loans to construction builders as well as single-family borrowers.
TABLE 11. Commercial Real Estate- Income Producing and construction by Property Type Concentration
Residential mortgages totaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, down $325.4 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2019. The decrease in mortgage loans is due primarily to refinance activity as a result of the lower rate environment and a higher level of originated loans sold in the secondary market. The decrease is net of mortgage loan originations of $743 million during 2020, which were retained in the portfolio. Consumer loans totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $308 million, or 14%, compared to December 31, 2019. The decline in the consumer loan portfolio is due in part to a decrease of $165 million with the wind down of our indirect auto lending, as well as limited demand as a result of the pandemic.
The markets we serve have been negatively impacted by the widespread economic slowdown and market turmoil caused by the pandemic and prolonged volatility of oil prices. While we expect continued stress among all of our loan portfolios, we have identified four principle sectors that are of particular focus where we expect there may be a greater negative economic impact and a more challenging recovery. We are closely monitoring our concentrations in these industries and others with active and frequent borrower dialogue and, where warranted, accommodations and financial support. These industries and others have been significantly impacted by the pandemic and the long-term impacts remain unknown and are dependent on several factors, including the severity of the economic downturn and length of time until full recovery. We recognize that these industries may take longer to recover as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction or may change their spending habits on a more permanent basis as a result of the pandemic. We continue to monitor these concentrations closely.
The table below summarizes our funded commercial loan exposure to these sectors under focus at December 31, 2020 and the relative concentration to the total loan portfolio, excluding low-risk SBA guaranteed PPP loans. Loans within our sectors under focus total approximately 25% of total loans outstanding, excluding PPP loans, and comprise nearly 50% of both our commercial criticized and pass watch rated loans.
TABLE 12. Sectors under Focus
* Excludes PPP loans
The following table shows average loans by category, the effective taxable equivalent yield and the percentage of total loans for each of the preceding three years:
TABLE 13. Average Loans
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the approximate contractual maturity by type of the loan portfolio.
TABLE 14. Loan Maturities by Type
The sensitivity to interest rate changes for the portion of our loan portfolio that matures after one year is shown below.
TABLE 15. Loan Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates
Asset Quality
The following table sets forth nonperforming assets by type for the periods indicated, consisting of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings and other real estate owned (ORE) and foreclosed assets. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are also disclosed.
TABLE 16. Nonperforming Assets
(a)
Nonaccrual loans do not include purchased credit impaired loans which were accounted for under ASC 310-30 that would have otherwise been considered nonperforming, totaling $17.5 million at December 31, 2019. Effective January 1, 2020, with the Adoption of ASC 326, nonaccrual loans include both originated and acquired balances
(b)
Includes total nonaccrual loans, total restructured loans-still accruing and ORE and foreclosed assets.
Nonperforming assets were $155.8 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $181.7 million, or 54%, compared to $337.5 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in nonperforming assets was driven by a $163.0 million decrease in nonperforming loans, which includes nonaccrual loans and TDRs still accruing. The decline in nonperforming loans was primarily attributable to the energy loan sale closed in July 2020, as well as additional charge-offs taken during the year, partially offset by new downgrades. ORE and foreclosed assets totaled $11.6 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $18.8 million from December 31, 2019, due in-part to $9.8 million in write-downs of equity interests received in two energy-related borrower bankruptcy restructurings, as well as resolution of other properties while foreclosures were suspended for much of 2020.
Nonenergy nonperforming loans totaled $132.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $149.2 million at December 31, 2019, was comprised of $64.8 million of commercial loans and $67.2 million of consumer loans. The commercial nonenergy nonperforming loans are spread across various industries and geographies. Our energy-related nonperforming loans totaled $12.1 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $157.9 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting the sale of a portion of the portfolio.
Loans modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) totaled $25.8 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $193.7 million at December 31, 2019, including $21.6 million and $132.5 million, respectively, of loans reported in nonaccrual loans. The decrease from December 31, 2019 is primarily related to the energy loan sale. TDRs arise when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near-term and, consequently, a modification that would otherwise not be considered is granted to the borrower. Certain loans modified in a TDR may continue to accrue interest when the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower indicate that we will collect all amounts due. Accruing TDRs totaled $4.3 million, or 3% of nonperforming loans, at December 31, 2020, down from $61.3 million, or 20% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019. The $57.0 million decrease is also mainly attributable to the energy loan sale.
Our TDR disclosures do not include loans modified under Section 4013 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which allows financial institutions to exclude eligible modifications from TDR assessment. Eligible modification must be (1) related to COVID-19, (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and (3) executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of the termination of the national emergency or January 1, 2022, as amended. At December 31, 2020, there were 176 loans totaling $630.6 million with active short-term payment deferrals or other qualifying CARES Act modifications. These loans continue to be monitored, risk rated, placed on nonaccrual or charged-off in accordance with our customary policies and procedures.
Criticized commercial loans totaled $392.6 million at December 31, 2020, down $188.1 million, or 32%, compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease in commercial criticized loans includes $169.2 million from the energy portfolio, largely attributable to the energy loan sale as well as additional charge-offs and paydowns, and $18.9 million attributable to the nonenergy portfolio. Criticized loans are defined as those having potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention (risk-rated special mention, substandard and doubtful), including both accruing and nonaccruing loans. Our commercial nonenergy criticized portfolio, totaling $301.8 million at December 31, 2020, and includes approximately $116.8 million of loans that are in our previously discussed sectors under focus that have been adversely impacted by the pandemic, with the remaining portion diversified as to industry. Commercial nonenergy criticized loans comprised 2.02% of that portfolio at December 31, 2020, excluding PPP loans, down from 2.12% at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, criticized loans in the energy portfolio were $90.9 million, or approximately 30% of that portfolio.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses”, commonly referred to as Current Expected Credit Losses or CECL. The provisions of this guidance required a material change to the manner in which we estimate and report credit losses from an incurred loss methodology to one that recognizes at the reporting date, the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our adoption of this guidance was on a modified retrospective approach, which resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of $76.7 million to allowance for credit losses, consisting of $49.4 million in the allowance for loan losses and $27.3 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The cumulative effect adjustment is the result of the difference between estimated incurred losses at the adoption date and the forward-looking projected losses over the remaining estimated term of the financial instruments, which was largely driven by our longer-term assets as well as expected future funding of construction lending and certain other revolving products. Refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a description of our CECL methodology and the impact of adoption.
At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was $480.1 million, consisting of $450.2 million in allowance for loan losses and $29.9 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for credit losses was $195.2 million at December 31, 2019, consisting of $191.2 million in funded allowance for loan losses and $4.0 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The $284.9 million increase in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2019, reflects the $76.7
million cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of CECL and a net reserve build of $208.1 million, which included increases for pandemic-related impacts to the economy, net of the impact of the energy loan sale.
The $208.1 million increase in the December 31, 2020 allowance for credit losses compared to our CECL day one allowance is primarily due to higher collectively evaluated reserves of $220.4 million, partially offset by lower individually evaluated reserves (generally used for nonperforming loans and loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring) of $12.3 million, down largely due to the energy loan sale. The Company probability-weighted three Moody’s macroeconomic scenarios in the calculation of our collectively evaluated allowance for credit losses. The baseline scenario was weighted most heavily at 65% and the downside slower near-term growth S-2 scenario and downside recessionary scenario S-3 scenario were weighted 25% and 10%, respectively, to incorporate reasonably possible alternative economic outcomes. All three economic scenarios utilized reflect a gradual recovery from the recessionary first half of 2020; however, each downside scenario has varying degrees of severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and duration of recovery. The baseline scenario reflects what we believe to be the most likely outcome, and, therefore was given the greatest probability weighting, and the alternative scenarios reflect reasonably possible outcomes due to the uncertainty in the economy in the near-term.
The December 2020 baseline forecast used in our analysis assumes that the new cases of COVID-19 peaked in late December 2020 and does not include new widespread business closures. In this scenario, a vaccine is expected to be widely available in February 2021 and cases are expected to abate by September 2021. Positive job numbers reported to-date have led to a slightly quicker recovery in the U.S. job market than forecasted in the September baseline scenario. This scenario also includes the $900 billion fiscal stimulus package passed in December 2020 to aid in the recovery. Additional information on the December baseline forecast is provided in the “Economic Outlook and Ongoing Impact of COVID-19” of this document. The slower near-term growth S-2 forecast reflects a slower economic recovery than the baseline forecast, with a delay in the widespread availability of the vaccine until May 2021 and a delay in the abatement of coronavirus cases to November 2021. This forecast assumes that restrictions on travel and business wind down somewhat more slowly, resulting in higher unemployment rates than the baseline scenario in the reasonable and supportable period. Sustained recovery does not occur until after cases abate in the fourth quarter of 2021. The recessionary S-3 forecast assumes a double-dip recession for the first three quarters of 2021, with a delay in the widespread availability of the vaccine until July 2021 and a delay in the abatement of coronavirus cases in February 2022. The prolonged impact of the coronavirus pandemic results in higher unemployment and business bankruptcies than the baseline scenario in the reasonable and supportable period. Sustained recovery does not occur until after cases abate in the first quarter of 2022.
Our allowance for credit loss coverage to total loans remains strong at 2.20% at December 31, 2020, or 2.42% when excluding SBA guaranteed PPP loans, compared to the CECL day one coverage of 1.28%, and reflects the economic impact of the pandemic on our market. The allowance coverage under the incurred loss methodology at December 31, 2019 was 0.92%.
The allowance for credit losses on the commercial nonenergy portfolio increased to $363.9 million, or 2.15% of that portfolio, at December 31, 2020 compared to the January 1, 2020 allowance (reflecting the adoption of CECL) of $156.9 million, or 1.04%. The increase in the allowance on this portfolio is due to the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly on loans to borrowers within industries heavily impacted by widespread shutdowns, reduced travel and other limitations on activity, such as hospitality and tourism, which includes hotels, restaurants, and bars; certain nonessential healthcare; and certain types of retail outlets and lessors of real estate to entities in those industries. The allowance for credit losses on the energy portfolio decreased to $19.6 million, or 6.36% of that portfolio, compared to the January 1, 2020 allowance of $46.3 million, or 4.81%. The decrease in allowance reflects both the reserve release following the loan sale in the second quarter of 2020 and a continued strong reserve on the remaining portfolio due to the volatility in energy prices and depressed global demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Our residential mortgage reserve for credit losses increased to $48.9 million, or 1.83%, at December 31, 2020, compared to $33.3 million, or 1.11%, at January 1, 2020, due primarily to expected impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Our allowance for credit losses on the consumer portfolio was $47.8 million, or 2.57 % at December 31, 2020, compared to $35.5 million, or 1.64 % at January 1, 2020, due primarily to expected impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Net charge-offs during 2020 were $394.8 million, or 1.78% of average total loans, up from net charge-offs of $47.0 million, or 0.23% of average total loans, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs in 2020 included a $242.6 million charge related to the energy loan sale and net charge-offs in 2019 included a $9.0 million net fraud related charge for an equipment finance credit. Energy net charge-offs contributed $308.4 million, and $10.1 million to total losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Commercial nonenergy net charge-offs increased $64.5 million during 2020 to $86.2 million, primarily as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic. Residential mortgage net recovery in 2020 was $1.1 million compared to net charge-offs in 2019 of $0.4 million. Consumer net charge-offs were down $3.2 million in 2020 to $11.6 million.
The following table sets forth activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:
TABLE 17. Summary of Activity in the Allowance for Credit Losses
An allocation of the loan loss allowance by major loan category is set forth in the following table. The January 1, 2020 allowance reflects the allowance upon adoption of CECL, whereas the December 31, 2019 allowance is under the previous incurred loss methodology.
TABLE 18. Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses by Category
Short-Term Investments
At December 31, 2020, short-term liquidity investments, including interest-bearing bank deposits and federal funds sold, totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from December 31, 2019. Average short-term investments for 2020 totaled $583 million, a $392 million increase from $191 million in 2019. The increase in short-term investments is a result of excess liquidity due to increased deposits, excess funds from PPP loan forgiveness and other paydowns and limited loan demand. Short-term liquidity assets are held to ensure funds are available to meet the cash flow needs of both borrowers and depositors. See further discussion in the “Liquidity” section that follows.
Deposits
Total deposits were $27.7 billion at December 31, 2020, up $3.9 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2019. Average deposits of $26.2 billion for 2020 were up $2.9 billion, or 13%, over 2019. The increases from 2019 for both end of period and average deposits was primarily pandemic-related, with increases PPP loan proceeds, economic stimulus payments, and overall lower levels of spending.
At December 31, 2020, noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $12.2 billion, up $3.4 billion, or 39%, from December 31, 2019. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 44% of total deposits at December 31, 2020 and 37% at December 31, 2019.
Interest-bearing transaction and savings accounts of $10.4 billion at December 31, 2020, increased $1.6 billion, or 18%, from December 31, 2019.
Interest-bearing public fund deposits totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020, down $129 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2019. Year-end public fund account balances are subject to annual fluctuations dependent upon a number of factors, including the timing of tax collections. Seasonal cash inflows from public entities in the fourth quarter of each year typically results in higher balances than at other times during the year with subsequent reductions in the first quarter of the following year.
Time deposits other than public funds totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2020, down $969 million, or 34%, from December 31, 2019. The decrease is driven primarily by aggressive rate strategy to lower the cost of deposits, including the decision to not renew maturing brokered certificates of deposit. Brokered certificates of deposit declined to $66 million at December 31, 2020 from $168 million at December 31, 2019.
Table 19 sets forth average balances and weighted-average rates paid on deposits for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, as well as the percentage of total deposits for each category. Table 20 sets forth the maturities of time certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 at December 31, 2020.
TABLE 19. Average Deposits
TABLE 20. Maturity of Time Certificates of Deposit greater than or equal to $250,000*
* Includes public fund time deposits
We have estimated that the Bank’s amount of uninsured assessable deposits to be approximately $13.7 billion, using the methodologies and assumptions required for FDIC regulatory reporting.
Short-Term Borrowings
Short-term borrowings totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020, down $1.0 billion from December 31, 2019. Average short-term borrowings for 2020 totaled $2.0 billion, down $36 million compared to 2019. The decrease in short-term borrowings is the result of utilization of increased liquidity on the balance sheet to pay down higher-rate borrowings. Short-term borrowings are a core portion of the Company’s funding strategy and can fluctuate depending on our funding needs and the sources utilized.
Table 21 sets forth balances of short-term borrowings for each of the past three years. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the FHLB. Customer repurchase agreements are a source of customer funding. These agreements are offered mainly to commercial customers to assist them with their ongoing cash management strategies or to provide a temporary investment vehicle for their excess liquidity pending redeployment for corporate or investment purposes. While customer repurchase agreements provide a recurring source of funds to the Bank, the amounts available over time will vary.
TABLE 21. Short-Term Borrowings
The $1.1 billion of FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2020 consists of five fixed rate notes maturing between 2034 and 2035 that are classified as short-term as the FHLB has the option to put (terminate) the advance prior to maturity.
Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt totaled $378.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $233.5 million at December 31, 2019. On June 9, 2020, we completed the issuance of subordinated notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million with a stated maturity of June 15, 2060. The notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per annum, with quarterly interest payments that began September 15, 2020. Subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve, the Company may redeem the notes in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after June 15, 2025. This debt qualifies as tier 2 capital in the calculation of certain regulatory capital ratios and was issued as part of a de-risking strategy.
Long-term debt also includes subordinated notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of $150 million with a stated maturity of June 15, 2045 with a fixed rate of 5.95% per annum. Subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve, the Company may redeem these notes in whole or in part on any of its quarterly interest payment dates after June 15, 2020. This debt also qualifies as tier 2 capital in the calculation of certain regulatory capital ratios. The remaining long-term debt is comprised primarily of borrowings associated with tax credit fund activities.
Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into financial instruments, such as commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of their customers. Such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded, although they expose the Bank to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans.
Commitments to extend credit totaled $8.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Commitments to lend include revolving commercial credit lines, non-revolving loan commitments issued mainly to finance the acquisition and development of construction of real property or equipment, and credit card and personal credit lines. The availability of funds under commercial credit lines and loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract, which may include the maintenance of sufficient collateral coverage levels, payment and financial performance, and compliance with other contractual conditions. Loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to adjustment or cancellation if the borrower’s credit quality deteriorates. A number of commercial and personal credit lines are used only partially or, in some cases, not at all before they expire, and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Letters of credit totaled $365.5 million at December 31, 2020. A substantial majority of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the Bank to fulfill a customer’s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform. The Bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to customers’ other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors of essential goods and services.
The contract amounts of these instruments reflect our exposure to credit risk. The Bank undertakes the same credit evaluation in making loan commitments and assuming conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $29.9 million.
The following table shows the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31, 2020 and 2019 according to expiration date.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
We proactively manage risks to capture opportunities and maximize shareholder value. We balance revenue generation and profitability with the inherent risks of our business activities. Enterprise risk management helps protect shareholder value by assessing, monitoring, and managing the risks associated with our businesses. Strong risk management practices enhance decision-making, facilitate successful implementation of new initiatives, and where appropriate, support undertaking greater levels of well-managed risk to drive growth and achieve strategic objectives. Our risk management culture integrates a board-approved risk appetite with senior management direction and governance to facilitate the execution of the Company’s strategic plan. This integration ensures the daily management of risks by product types and continuous corporate monitoring of the levels of risk across the Company. We make changes to our enterprise risk management program and risk governance framework as described here at the direction of senior management and the Board of Directors to capture opportunities and to respond to changes in strategic, business, and operational environments.
Risk Categories and Definitions
Consistent with other participants in the financial services industry, the primary risk exposures of the Company are credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, reputational, and strategic. We have adopted these seven risk categories as outlined by the Federal Reserve Board and other bank regulators to govern the risk management of banks and bank holding companies. Oversight responsibility for these categories is assigned within our risk committee governance structure:
•
Credit risk arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation.
•
Market risk is a financial institution’s condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or equity prices.
•
Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as “funding liquidity risk”) or that it cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (“market liquidity risk”).
•
Operational risk is the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, breaches in customer data, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. Consistently and interchangeably for the Company, Basel II defines this risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The Company assesses compliance risk, the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards, as a subcategory of operational risk.
•
Legal risk is the potential that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of a banking organization.
•
Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. The Company also recognizes its reputation with shareholders and associates is an important factor of reputational risk.
•
Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the competitive landscape of banking and financial services industries and operating environment.
Risk Committee Governance Structure
Effective risk management governance requires active oversight, participation, and interaction by senior management and the Board of Directors. Our enterprise risk management framework uses a tiered risk/reward committee structure to facilitate the timely discussion of significant risks, issues and risk mitigation strategies to inform management and the Board’s decision making. Additionally, the committee structure provides ongoing oversight and facilitates escalation within assigned risk committees. Following is a summary of our risk governance structure and related responsibilities:
•
Board risk committees. The Company’s Board of Directors has established a Board Risk Committee and Credit Risk Management Subcommittee of the Board Risk Committee to oversee the effective establishment of a risk governance framework, provide for an independent Credit Review assurance function, ensure the overall corporate risk profile is within its risk appetite, and direct changes or make recommendations to the Board of Directors when determined necessary. Additionally, the Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee to provide independent oversight on the effectiveness of these matters and the Company’s internal control environment. The Board Risk Committee is chaired by an independent director. The Board has designated Ms. Joan Teofilo and Ms. Suzette Kent, independent directors who serve on the Board Risk Committee, as risk management experts.
•
Governance committees. The Capital Committee (CAPCO) of the Company serves as the senior level management risk/reward committee and oversees the business strategy, organizational structure, capital planning, and liquidity strategies for the Company. CAPCO directly oversees the strategic and reputation risk categories, which include litigation strategy and the development of capital stress testing within the Company’s risk governance framework. CAPCO drives business strategy development and execution, provides corporate financial oversight, and is responsible for portfolio risk committee oversight. CAPCO provides oversight of the portfolio risk/reward committees to ensure tactics to address business strategy changes are properly vetted and adopted, and protect the Company’s reputation.
•
Portfolio committees. The Company has three portfolio risk/reward committees focusing on credit (CREDCO), market and liquidity through asset/liability management (ALCO), and operational, legal and compliance (OPCO) risk categories. These committees review and monitor the risk categories in a portfolio context ensuring risk assessment and management processes are being effectively executed to identify and manage risk and direct changes and escalate issues to CAPCO and Board Risk Committees when needed. The committees also monitor the risk portfolios for changes to the Company’s risk profile as well as ensure the risk portfolio is performing within the board-approved risk appetite. Portfolio committees report to CAPCO.
Risk Leadership and Organization
The risk management function of the Company, which includes the Chief Risk Officer, is led by the President of Hancock Whitney Bank. The Chief Risk Officer provides overall vision, direction and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management program. The Chief Risk Officer exercises independent judgment and reporting of risk through a direct working relationship with the Board Risk Committee, and the Chief Credit Officer has the same role with the Credit Risk Management Subcommittee. The functional areas reporting to the Chief Risk Officer are the enterprise risk management program office, operational risk management, model validation, regulatory relations, corporate insurance and the enterprise-wide compliance program. The Chief Risk Officer also works closely with the Chief Internal Auditor to provide assurance to the Board and senior management regarding risk management controls and their effectiveness. The Chief Internal Auditor reports to the Board’s Audit Committee to assure independence of the internal audit function. Other risk management functions reporting to the President include the Chief Credit Officer and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Officer.
Credit Risk
The Bank’s primary lending focus is to provide commercial, consumer, and real estate loans to consumers, to small and middle market businesses, to larger corporate clients in their respective market areas, and to state, county, and municipal government entities. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means to reduce the risks associated with economic fluctuations. The Bank has no significant concentrations of loans to individual borrowers or foreign entities.
Our commercial and industrial portfolio, which includes commercial non-real estate and owner occupied commercial real estate lending is diverse across various industries. We continuously manage our exposure to improve our cross industry diversification, and proactively manage potential impacts to earnings.
Real estate loan levels are monitored throughout the year and the bank currently does not have a commercial real estate concentration as defined by interagency guidelines.
Managing collateral is also an essential component of managing the Bank’s real estate-and non-real estate related credit risk exposure. For real estate-secured loans, third party valuations are obtained at the time of origination, and updated if it is determined that the collateral value has deteriorated or if the loan is deemed to be a problem loan. Property valuations are ordered through, and reviewed by, the Bank’s appraisal department. When deemed necessary, third party valuations may also be obtained for non-real estate collateral based on the same criteria as real estate secured loans. Such valuations, along with anticipated selling costs, are used to determine if there is loan impairment, leading to a recommendation for partial charge off or appropriate allowance allocation.
The Bank maintains an active Credit Review function, whose Credit Review Manager reports to the Credit Risk Management Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Board Risk Committee, to help ensure that developing credit concerns are identified and addressed in a timely manner. Further, an active watch list review process is in place as part of the Bank’s problem loan management strategy, and a list of loans 90 days past due and still accruing is reviewed with management (including the Chief Credit Officer) at least monthly. Recommendations flow from all of the above activities with the goal of recognizing nonperforming loans and determining the appropriate accrual status.
Asset/Liability Management
Asset/liability management consists of quantifying, analyzing and controlling interest rate risk (IRR) to maintain stability in net interest income under varying interest rate environments. The principal objective of asset/liability management is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable risk limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of liquidity. Our net earnings are materially dependent on our net interest income.
IRR on the Company’s balance sheet consists of reprice, option, yield curve, and basis risks. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from “embedded options” present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options, deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options. These options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change, which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the Company. Yield curve risk refers to the risk resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices, which subsequently result in changes to the profit spread on an earning asset or liability. Basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities, such as savings accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates.
ALCO manages our IRR exposures through pro-active measurement, monitoring, and management actions. ALCO is responsible for maintaining levels of IRR within limits approved by the Board of Directors through a risk management policy that is designed to promote a stable net interest margin in periods of interest rate fluctuation. Accordingly, the Company’s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by its ALCO, which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures, limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. A variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk, the distribution of risk, the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships.
The Company utilizes an asset/liability model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of IRR associated with changing market rates. The model is used to perform net interest income, economic value of equity, and gap analyses. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next twelve-month and 24-month periods. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next 24 months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. The impact of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, caps and floors, is also included in the model. Other interest rate-related risks such as prepayment, basis and option risk are also considered.
Net Interest Income at Risk
Our primary market risk is interest rate risk that stems from uncertainty with respect to the absolute and relative levels of future market interest rates that affect our financial products and services. In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, management measures the sensitivity of our net interest income and cash flows under various market interest rate scenarios, establishes interest rate risk management policies and implements asset/liability management strategies designed to promote a relatively stable net interest margin under varying rate environments.
The following table presents an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in net interest income resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in rates at December 31, 2020. Shifts are measured in 100 basis point increments in a range from -500 to +500 basis points from base case, with +100 through +300 basis points presented in Table 23. Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions including loan and deposit repricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments and other factors. The base scenario assumes that the current interest rate environment is held constant over a 24-month forecast period and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income. Policy limits on the change in net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios are approved by the Board of Directors. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled.
TABLE 23. Net Interest Income (te) at Risk
The results indicate a general asset sensitivity across most scenarios driven primarily by repricing in variable rate loans and a funding mix which is composed of material volumes of non-interest bearing and lower rate sensitive deposits. Elevated levels of short-term investments at year-end also contributed to the overall level of asset sensitivity report. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk with on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.
Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as anticipated. Additionally, a change in the U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to net interest income than indicated above. Strategic management of our balance sheet and earnings is fluid and would be adjusted to accommodate these movements. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets such as adjustable-rate loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Also, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. All of these factors are considered in monitoring exposure to interest rate risk.
In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In November 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021; but, the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 30, 2023. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, the bank regulatory agencies have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly. Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.
It is not possible to predict what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. In particular, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC)) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., AMERIBOR or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these
specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.
We have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies.
Management has established a LIBOR Transition Working Group (the “Group”) whose purpose is to direct the overall transition process for the Company. The Group is an internal, cross-functional team with representatives from business lines, support and control functions and legal counsel. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, key provisions in our loan documents were modified to ensure new and renewed loans include appropriate pre-cessation trigger language and LIBOR fallback language for transition from LIBOR to the new benchmark when such transition occurs. All direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after 2021 have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis. Remediation of these exposures will be consistent with industry timing. The Group has also inventoried indirect LIBOR exposures within the Company's systems, models and processes. The results of this assessment will drive development and prioritization of remediation plans, and the Group is continuing to monitor developments and taking steps to ensure readiness when the LIBOR benchmark rate is discontinued. Failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 30% of our loan portfolio consisted of variable rate loans tied to LIBOR, along with related derivatives and other financial instruments.
Liquidity
Liquidity management ensures that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, while also meeting the operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs of the Company, the Bank and other subsidiaries. As part of the overall asset and liability management process, liquidity management strategies and measurements have been developed to manage and monitor liquidity risk. The Company enacted strategies in 2020 to strengthen liquidity through various measures to ensure funds are available to meet the needs of our day to day operations and those of our customers during the unprecedented period of disruption in financial and credit markets resulting from the pandemic. At December 31, 2020, we had $17.5 billion in net available sources of funds, summarized as follows:
TABLE 24. Net Available Sources of Funds
TABLE 25. Liquidity Metrics
The asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments, maturities and repayments of investment securities and occasional sales of various assets. Short-term investments such as federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank or with other commercial banks are additional
sources of liquidity to meet cash flow requirements. Free securities represent unpledged securities that can be sold or used as collateral for borrowings, and include unpledged securities assigned to short-term dealer repurchase agreements or to the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. Management has established an internal target for the ratio of free securities to total securities to be 20% or more. As shown in Table 25 above, our ratios of free securities to total securities were 54.21% and 47.27%, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Securities and FHLB letters of credit are pledged as collateral related to public funds and repurchase agreements. The total pledged securities of $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020 were up $77 million compared to December 31, 2019.
The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity mainly through the ability to use cash sourced from various customers’ interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts and sweep accounts. At December 31, 2020, deposits totaled $27.7 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2019. This increase was largely attributable to the increase in noninterest-bearing deposits following the funding of PPP loans deposited into business accounts, the issuance of government stimulus payments to our retail customers and overall reduced spending. Core deposits represent total deposits excluding certificates of deposits (“CDs”) of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits. The ratio of core deposits to total deposits was 97.14% at December 31, 2020, compared to 93.54% at December 31, 2019. Core deposits totaled $26.9 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.6 billion from December 31, 2019. Brokered deposits totaled $66 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $168 million at December 31, 2019. Brokered deposits declined as brokered certificates that matured were not reissued as part of our effort to utilize excess liquidity. The use of brokered deposits as a funding source is subject of certain policies regarding the amount, term and interest rate.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Bank implemented a reciprocal deposit program that allows depositors to place their uninsured deposits with other FDIC insured financial institutions in order to obtain FDIC insurance on those deposits, and allows us to reciprocate those deposits. To-date, there has been only minimal activity in this program.
Purchases of federal funds, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings from customers provide additional sources of liquidity to meet short-term funding requirements. In addition to funding from customer sources, the Bank has a line of credit with the FHLB that is secured by blanket pledges of certain mortgage loans. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had borrowed $1.1 billion from the FHLB and had approximately $3.4 billion remaining available under this line. The Bank also has unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve’s discount window of approximately $4.4 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, or at any point during the years then ended.
Wholesale funds, comprised of short-term borrowings, long-term debt and brokered deposits were 7.85% of core deposits at December 31, 2020 and 13.99% at December 31, 2019. Wholesale funds totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.0 billion from December 31, 2019. As previously discussed, core deposits at December 31, 2020 increased $4.6 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The Company has established an internal target for wholesale funds to be less than 25% of core deposits.
Another key measure the Company uses to monitor its liquidity position is the loan to deposit ratio (average loans outstanding for the reporting period divided by average deposits outstanding). The loan-to-deposit ratio measures the amount of funds the Company lends for each dollar of deposits on hand. Our average loan-to-deposit ratio was 84.57% for 2020 compared to 87.47% in 2019. Management has established a target range for the loan to deposit ratio of 87% to 89%, but may operate outside that range under certain circumstances.
Dividends received from the Bank have been the primary source of funds available to the Parent Company for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for servicing its debt. The liquidity management process takes into account the various regulatory provisions that can limit the amount of dividends that the Bank can distribute to the Parent Company, as described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, “Stockholders’ Equity.” The Parent targets cash and other liquid assets to provide liquidity in an amount sufficient to fund approximately four quarters of anticipated common stockholder dividends, but will temporarily operate below that level if a return to the target can be achieved in the near-term. On June 9, 2020, the Parent completed the issuance of subordinated note payable with an aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million, providing additional liquidity that can be used by the Parent or to provide capital to the Bank, if deemed appropriate.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal controls and processes, people and systems, or from external events, including fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. We depend on the ability of our employees and systems to process, record and monitor a large number of transactions on an on-going basis. As operational risk remains elevated and as customer and regulatory expectations regarding information security have increased, the Company continues to enhance its controls, processes and systems in order to protect the Company’s networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.
Cybersecurity is a significant operational risk for financial institutions as a result of increases in the number of incidents and the sophistication of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks include computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, credential validation, denial of service, phishing, and employee malfeasance, each utilized to disrupt the operations of a financial institution, which in certain instances have resulted in unauthorized access to confidential, proprietary or other information, including customer account information.
The Board Risk Committee has primary responsibility for the oversight of operational risk. In this capacity, the Board Risk Committee oversees the Company’s processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing cybersecurity risk. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), a member of management, supports the information security risk oversight responsibilities of the Board and its committees and involves the appropriate personnel in information risk management. The CISO attends Board Risk Committee meetings on a quarterly basis and sits in executive session with the Board Risk Committee members twice each year. The CISO annually provides an Information Security Program Summary report to the Board, outlining the overall status of our Information Security Program and the Company’s compliance with regulatory guidelines. In addition, individual business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities.
The CISO is also responsible for managing the day-to-day cybersecurity operations and leads the IT Risk Governance Subcommittee, a management level committee, whose objective is to protect the integrity, security, safety and resiliency of our corporate information systems and assets. This committee meets regularly to review the development of our Information Security Program. Our Information Security Program is comprised of a collection of policies, guidelines and procedures, which are regularly updated and approved by appropriate management committees. As part of our Information Security Program, we have adopted a Comprehensive Information Security Policy and an Incident Response Plan. The Incident Response Plan is intended to proceed on parallel paths in the event of an incident, including implementation of (i) a forensic and containment, eradication and remediation plan, and (ii) a line of business response plan (including legal, compliance, business, insurance and communications).
We contract with outside vendors on an annual basis to conduct vulnerability/penetration tests against the Company’s network. We have also contracted with third parties to assist in cyber incident response, forensics and communications. Any third party service provider or vendor utilized as part of the Company’s cybersecurity framework is required to comply with the Company’s policies regarding non-public personal information and information security. In addition, information security training programs are in place for all new associates, as well as required annual training for all associates. Internal policies and procedures have been adopted to encourage the reporting of potential security attacks or risks.
To date, the Company has not experienced an attack that has significantly impacted its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Addressing cybersecurity risks is a priority for the Company, and the Company is committed to enhancing its systems of internal controls and business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company currently has a strong capital position which is vital to continued profitability, promotes depositor and investor confidence, and provides a solid foundation for economic downturns, future growth and flexibility in addressing strategic opportunities. Stockholders’ equity totaled $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The $28.7 million decrease is attributable to the net operating loss for the year of $45.2 million, dividends of $95.6 million and the cumulative effect of adopting the CECL standard of $44.1 million. These declines were partially offset by a gain of $134.8 million in other comprehensive income largely related to the market adjustment on the available for sale securities portfolio and cash flow hedges and other stock-based compensation and stock repurchase activity.
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio was 7.64%, compared to 8.45% at December 31, 2019. The decrease from 2019 is primarily attributable to a relatively flat tangible equity compared to the significant growth in tangible assets, which was largely driven by the origination of low-risk SBA guaranteed PPP loans. Following the de-risking strategies executed
during the first half of 2020 that included the sale of a large portion of our energy exposure at a loss, the Tangible Common Equity ratio declined below management’s internal target of at least 8.00%; however, the ratio continued to improve during the second half of the year.
The primary quantitative measures that regulators use to gauge capital adequacy are the ratios of Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (risk-based capital ratios) and the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets (Leverage ratio). The Federal Reserve Board’s final rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related changes per the Dodd-Frank Act established the Basel III minimum regulatory capital requirements for all organizations for Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios equal to 8.00%, 6.00%, and 4.5%, respectively, as well as set a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a Leverage ratio of 4.0%. Based on capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 using Basel III definitions, the Company and the Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the rule. The Company and the Bank have established internal target ranges for Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios and the leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, each of these capital ratios fell within their respective target range.
At December 31, 2020, our regulatory capital ratios were well in excess of current regulatory minimum requirements, including the conservatism buffers, by at least $500 million. Additionally, both the Company and the Bank were considered “well capitalized” by regulatory agencies. The following table shows the Company’s capital ratios for the past five years. Note 12 - Stockholders’ Equity to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.
The following table shows the Company’s regulatory capital ratios as calculated under current rules for the indicated periods. The capital ratios at December 31, 2020 reflect the election to use the interim final five-year transition rule issued on March 27, 2020 available for institutions required to adopt CECL as of January 1, 2020. The new CECL transition rule allows for the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (0%), followed by a three-year transition (25% in 2022, 50% in 2023, 75% in 2024, and 100% thereafter). In addition, the two-year delay also includes the full impact of January 1, 2020 cumulative effect impact plus an estimated impact of CECL calculated quarterly as 25% of the current ACL over the January 1, balance (modified transition amount). The modified transition amount is recalculated quarterly, with the December 31, 2021 impact carrying through remaining three-year transition. The election to use the revised final CECL transition rules favorably impacted our leverage ratio upon adoption by 19 bps and our Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios by 22 bps. See further discussion of CECL and the impact of adoption in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8 - “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this document.

*applies to Bank only
On June 9, 2020, the Parent completed the issuance of subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million and a stated maturity of June 15, 2060, that qualify as tier 2 capital in the calculation of certain regulatory capital ratios.
Throughout both 2020 and 2019, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.27 per share, for an annual cash dividend rate of $1.08 per share. The Company intends to pay its next quarterly dividend and is in consultation with its regulators regarding the dividend payment, while the board evaluates the dividend payout policy quarterly. The Company has paid uninterrupted quarterly dividends to shareholders since 1967.
As of December 31, 2020, PPP loans totaled $2.0 billion. These loans are guaranteed by the SBA, and when meeting certain regulatory criteria, are subject to forgiveness. These loans carry a 0% risk-weighting in the tier 1 and total capital regulatory ratios due to the full guarantee by the SBA. However, these loans are reflected in average assets used to compute tier 1 leverage.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On September 23, 2019, the Company’s board of directors approved a stock buyback program that authorized the Company to repurchase up to 5.5 million shares of its common stock through the expiration date of December 31, 2020. The program allowed the Company to repurchase its common shares in the open market, by block purchase, through accelerated share repurchase programs, in privately negotiated transactions, or as otherwise determined by the Company in one or more transactions. The Company was not obligated to purchase any shares under this program, and the board of directors had the ability to terminate or amend the program at any time prior to the expiration date.
On October 18, 2019, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) to repurchase $185 million of the Company’s common stock. Pursuant to the ASR, the Company made a $185 million payment to Morgan Stanley on October 21, 2019, and received on the same day an initial delivery of 3.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Final settlement of the ASR occurred on March 18, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company received cash of approximately $12.1 million and a final delivery of 1.0 million shares.
In January 2020, the Company repurchased 315,851 shares of its common stock at a price of $40.26 in a privately negotiated transaction. In total, the Company repurchased approximately 4.9 million of the 5.5 million authorized shares under the buyback program at an average price of $37.65 per share through both the ASR agreement and the privately negotiated transaction. The Company suspended further repurchase of shares under the program in 2020.
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $103.6 million, or $1.17 per diluted common share, compared to $79.4 million, or $0.90, in the third quarter of 2020 and $92.1 million, or $1.03, in the fourth quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter of 2019 included $3.9 million ($.03 per share after-tax impact) of final merger costs associated with the September 2019 acquisition of MidSouth Bancorp, Inc.
Highlights of our fourth quarter of 2020 results (compared to third quarter 2020):
•
Implemented tax strategies that added approximately $0.21 to fourth quarter diluted earnings per share
•
Pre-tax pre-provision net revenue increased $4.3 million to $130.6 million, with revenue up $1.7 million and operating expense down $2.6 million
•
Net interest margin (te) remained steady at 3.22%, down 1 bp from the third quarter of 2020
•
Nonperforming loans declined $37 million, or 20%, and Criticized commercial loans declined $19 million, or 5%
•
Common equity tier 1 ratio was up 31 bps to 10.61%
•
Tangible common equity ratio was up 11 bps to 7.64%
•
Loans decreased $450 million driven by $318 million in net PPP loan forgiveness
•
Deposits increased $667 million primarily as a result of stimulus funds and seasonal year-end inflows
Total loans at December 31, 2020 were $21.8 billion, a decrease of $450 million, or 2%, from September 30, 2020. Loan growth in the Company’s commercial markets was offset by the PPP loan forgiveness and net declines in other amortizing loan portfolios, such as our indirect lending portfolio that is in run-off. Management expects loans to decline again in the first quarter of 2021, as significantly more PPP loans are forgiven and opportunities for new organic growth remain low. The Company will participate in the extended CARES Act PPP program and expects new loan growth to partially offset the declines noted above.
Total deposits at December 31, 2020 were $27.7 billion, up $667 million, or 2%, from September 30, 2020. The increase, almost half of which was in noninterest bearing deposits, was primarily driven by pandemic-related deposit growth and a seasonal increase in public funds.
Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $12.2 billion at December 31, 2020, up $318 million, or 3%, from September 30, 2020 and comprised 44% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. Interest-bearing transaction and savings deposits totaled $10.4 billion at December 31, 2020, up $442 million, or 4%, compared to September 30, 2020.
Time deposits of $1.8 billion decreased $152 million, or 8%, from September 30, 2020. The decrease in time deposits reflects a decrease in brokered deposits of $91 million and a decrease in retail CDs of $61 million. Interest-bearing public fund deposits increased $59 million, or 2%, to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in public funds is seasonal and primarily related to year-end tax collections by local municipalities. Typically, these balances begin to runoff in the first quarter of each year.
The provision for loan losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $24.2 million, down slightly from $25.0 million in the third quarter of 2020. Net charge-offs were $24.3 million, or 0.44% of average total loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $24.0 million, or 0.43% of average total loans, for the third quarter of 2020. Our credit loss outlook was unchanged compared to prior quarter and allowance for credit loss reserves were relatively flat. For the first quarter of 2021, we expect a provision for credit losses in the range of $10 million to $15 million, which could be lower depending on non-PPP loan growth and other factors. We also expect that net charge-offs could exceed provision expense.
Net interest income (te) for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $241.4 million, up $3.0 million from the third quarter of 2020. The increase in net interest income was primarily from an increase in earning assets, as well as a lower cost of deposits, driving down interest expense. The net interest margin (te) remained stable at 3.22%, down 1bp in the fourth quarter as the compression in our earning asset yield was mostly offset by the lower cost of funds. We expect the net interest margin to compress in the first quarter of 2021 due to high levels of excess liquidity and net PPP activity (forgiveness versus funding).
Noninterest income totaled $82.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, down $1.4 million, or 2%, from the third quarter of 2020. Improvement was noted in many fee categories with increased economy activity and consumer spending. Service charges were up $1.4 million, or 8%. Secondary mortgage operations totaled $11.5 million for the fourth quarter, down $1.4 million, from the third quarter, as refinancing activity slowed from peak levels earlier this year, but remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Other noninterest income was down $1.9 million from the third quarter, primarily due to lower specialty income. We expect noninterest income to be down in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to anticipated lower levels of specialty income and secondary mortgage fees.
Noninterest expense of $193.1 million, declined $2.6 million from the third quarter of 2020. The primary driver of the decrease was personnel expense, which was down $5.6 million, or 5%, related to efficiency measures taken to-date, including staff attrition and branch closures. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other expense of $3.0 million, or 6%, mostly attributable to nonrecurring hurricane related expenses and branch closures. We expect first quarter 2021 expenses to be flat to fourth quarter 2020 as efficiency initiatives continue to offset typical beginning of the year increases; this does not include nonrecurring charges for certain initiatives, such as recently announced early retirement packages.
Income tax strategies implemented at year-end led to a $0.3 million income tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2020. This net benefit reflects the impact of net operating loss carryback provisions included in the CARES Act. The company expects the effective tax rate to return to a normal quarterly range of 18-20% in 2021, absent any changes in tax laws. The effective income tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate primarily due to tax-exempt income and income tax credits.
The summary of quarterly financial information appearing in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” provides selected comparative financial information for each of the four quarters of 2020 and 2019.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
The accounting principles we follow and the methods for applying these principles conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and general practices followed by the banking industry. The significant accounting principles and practices we follow are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These principles and practices require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates the estimates and assumptions made on an ongoing basis to help ensure the resulting reported amounts reflect management’s best estimates and judgments given current facts and circumstances. The following discusses certain critical accounting policies that involve a higher degree of management judgment and complexity in producing estimates that may significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Allowance for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” commonly referred to as Current Expected Credit Losses or CECL, on a modified retrospective basis. The provisions of this guidance required a material change to the manner in which the Company estimates and reports losses on financial instruments, including loans and unfunded lending commitments, select investment securities, and other assets carried at amortized cost. For reporting periods beginning on or subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounting for credit losses and related disclosures are presented under ASC 326, while prior period results continue to be reported in accordance with previously effective guidance under ASC 310 - Receivables.
The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is comprised of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans and leases held for investment, and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, a liability established to absorb credit losses for the expected life of the contractual term of on and off-balance sheet exposures as of the date of the determination. The standard requires that management incorporate an economic forecast for a reasonable and supportable period, which is two years based on our current policy. We utilize third party forecasts that consist of multiple economic scenarios, including a baseline, with a probability distribution of 50% better or worse economic performance and various upside and downside scenarios utilized at an aggregated state (or regional) levels across our footprint or national level, depending on the portfolio. The economic forecasts are generally lagging and may not incorporate all events and circumstances through the financial statement date. The Company’s management considers available forecasts, current events not captured and our specific portfolio characteristics and applies weights to the scenario output based on a best estimate of likely outcomes. During 2020, the United States and global financial markets experienced unprecedented volatility, with significant uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including varying degrees of economic shutdown and a significant and sustained decline in oil prices. Restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus significantly reduced travel and impaired tourism and trade, which has resulted in deterioration in the Gulf Coast economy. Changing economic conditions and resulting government response in the form of interest rate adjustments and stimulus packages have introduced enhanced estimation uncertainty in the forecasts used to estimate expected credit loss. Our credit loss models were built using historical data that may not correlate to economic conditions stemming from the pandemic. The estimate of the life of a loan considers both contractual cash flows as well as estimated prepayments and forecasted draws on unfunded loan commitments that were also built on historical data that may react differently given the current environment. Such forecasted information is inherently uncertain, particularly in the volatile environment resulting from the pandemic. Forecast uncertainty includes the severity of the impact to local and global economic conditions as well as the timing of recovery, among other things. Therefore, actual results may differ significantly from management’s estimates.
The quantitative loss rate analysis is supplemented by a review of qualitative factors that considers whether conditions differ from those existing during the historical periods used in the development of the credit loss models. Such factors include, but are not limited to, problem loan trends, changes in loan profiles and volumes, changes in lending policies and procedures, current economic and business conditions, credit concentrations, model limitations and other factors not captured by our models. While quantitative data for these factors is used where available, there is a high level of judgment applied in these processes.
For credits that are individually evaluated, a specific allowance is calculated as the shortfall between the credit’s value and the bank’s exposure. The loan’s value is measured by either the loan’s observable market price, the fair value of the collateral of the loan (less liquidation costs) if it is collateral dependent, or by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. Collateral on impaired loans includes, but is not limited to, commercial and residential real estate, oil and gas reserves, marine vessels, accounts receivable and other corporate assets. Values for impaired credits are highly subjective and based on information available at the time of valuation and the current resolution strategy. These values are difficult to assess and have heightened uncertainty resulting from the impact of the pandemic on market conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Management considers the appropriateness of these critical assumptions as part of its allowance review and believes the ACL level is appropriate based on information available through the financial statement date. Refer to Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for further discussion of significant assumptions used in the current allowance calculation.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired, or the excess of the fair value of the net liabilities assumed over the consideration received. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. The impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value. We have assigned all goodwill to one reporting unit that represents our overall banking operations. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using valuation techniques that market participants would use in an acquisition of the whole unit, such as estimated discounted cash flows, the quoted market price of our common stock adjusted for a control premium, and observable average price-to forward-earnings and price-to-tangible book multiples of observed transactions. If the unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, an estimate of the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the goodwill’s carrying value and any impairment recognized.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of September 30, 2020, using multiple approaches to measure the fair value of the reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment. These methods included an income approach using the discounted net present value of estimated future cash flows and three market approaches using transaction or price-to-forward earnings multiples, price to tangible book value methodologies using the actual price paid in recent acquisition transactions for similar entities and a market capitalization approach using the Company’s stock price observed during the fourth quarter. The results from each of the approaches were weighted equally, with the valuation of the reporting unit approximately 17% in excess of net book value at September 30, 2020. Individually no valuation method resulted in estimated fair value less than the Company’s carrying value.
Valuation techniques employed by the Company require significant assumptions. Depending upon the specific approach, assumptions are made regarding the economic environment, expected net interest margins, growth rates, discount rate used to present value future cash flows, control premiums, and price-to-forward earnings and price to-tangible-book-value multiples. Changes to any one of these assumptions could result in significantly different results. Changes in the amount and/or timing of the Company’s expected future cash flows or estimated growth rates, lack of improvement and/or further decline in the price of the Company’s common stock relative to our book value per share, and/or further deterioration in the economic environment beyond current estimates could result in an impairment charge to goodwill in future reporting periods.
Acquisition Accounting
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Purchased assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities are recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values. Management applies various valuation methodologies to these assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued. Examples of such items include loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in business combinations. Management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items, including, among others, projected cash flows, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount rates, and realizable collateral values. The valuation of other identifiable assets, including core deposit and customer list intangibles, requires significant assumptions such as projected attrition rates, expected revenue and costs, discount rates and other forward-looking factors. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments also determine the amount of goodwill or bargain purchase gain recognized in connection with the business combination. Valuation assumptions and estimates may also have to be revisited in connection with periodic assessments of possible value impairment, including impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and certain other long-lived assets. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations.
Accounting for Retirement Benefits
Management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for benefits under the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts recognized and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of these plans. Two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value. Changes in these assumptions impact the cost of retirement benefits recognized in net income and comprehensive income. Certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date. For example, the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed-income investments. Other assumptions, such as the rate of return on assets, are determined, in part, with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision. Holding other factors constant, the cost of retirement benefits will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets. Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 18” provides further discussion on the accounting for retirement and employee benefit plans and the estimates used in determining the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit expense.
