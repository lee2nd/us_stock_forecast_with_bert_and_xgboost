ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are an acquisition holding company focused on acquiring and managing a group of small businesses, which we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than $50 million, in a variety of different industries headquartered in North America. To date, we have completed five acquisitions and distributed the stock of one of the acquired companies to our shareholders.
In March 2017, our subsidiary 1847 Neese acquired Neese. Headquartered in Grand Junction, Iowa and founded in 1991, Neese is an established business specializing in providing a wide range of land application services and selling equipment and parts, primarily to the agricultural industry, but also to the construction and lawn and garden industries.
In April 2019, our subsidiary Goedeker acquired substantially all of the assets of Goedeker Television, a one-stop e-commerce destination for home furnishings, including appliances, furniture, home goods and related products. On October 23, 2020, we distributed all of the shares of Goedeker that we held to our shareholders. As a result of this distribution, Goedeker is no longer a subsidiary of our company.
In May 2020, our subsidiary 1847 Asien acquired Asien’s. Asien’s has been in business since 1948 serving the North Bay area of Sonoma County, California. It provides a wide variety of appliance services, including sales, delivery/installation, in-home service and repair, extended warranties, and financing. Its main focus is delivering personal sales and exceptional service to its customers at competitive prices.
In September 2020, our subsidiary 1847 Cabinet acquired Kyle’s. Kyle’s is a leading custom cabinetry maker servicing contractors and homeowners since 1976 in Boise, Idaho and the surrounding area. Kyle’s focuses on designing, building, and installing custom cabinetry primarily for custom and semi-custom builders.
In March 2021, our subsidiary 1847 Wolo, acquired Wolo. Headquartered in Deer Park, New York and founded in 1965, Wolo designs and manufactures horn and safety products (electric, air, truck, marine, motorcycle and industrial equipment), and offers vehicle emergency and safety warning lights for cars, trucks, industrial equipment and emergency vehicles.
Through our structure, we offer investors an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or large conglomerates. We believe that our management and acquisition strategies will allow us to achieve our goals to begin making and growing regular distributions to our common shareholders and increasing common shareholder value over time.
Recent Developments
Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The virus has since spread to over 150 countries and every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. Most states and cities have reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, “stay at home” rules and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it.
Effective March 18, 2020, the County of Sonoma, California issued a shelter in place order. Pursuant to this order, non-essential businesses were ordered to close. Asien’s was qualified as an essential business and remained open under a modified service plan whereby customers were allowed access to the demonstration floor by appointment only with access limited to one customer party (following published guidelines a customer party was defined as no more than three adults and no children). Effective June 6, 2020, Sonoma County modified the retail guidelines for essential businesses and Asien’s store allowed access for retail customer parties without appointment but with limitations on the number of individuals allowed in the store. Asien’s has remained open since this date under these modified occupancy restrictions, so it did not experience any meaningful business interruption. However, Asien’s is dependent upon suppliers to provide it with all of the products that its sells. The pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact suppliers and manufacturers of certain of its products. As a result, Asien’s has faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products, which could negatively affect its business and financial results. Even if Asien’s is able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more, which could adversely impact Asien’s profitability and financial condition.
Idaho, where Kyle’s is located, issued a “stay at home” order beginning on March 27, 2020. The order was initially in place until April 15, then undergone several extensions, and was lifted on April 30, 2020. Currently, the state is under Stage 3 of Stay Healthy Guidelines, which allow businesses and governmental agencies to continue operations at physical locations in the state of Idaho; however, all individuals, businesses, and governmental agencies should adhere to the physical distancing and sanitation requirements prescribed. Kyle’s was in an industry designated as Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce and remained operational during the “stay at home” order; as such, Kyle’s remained, and continues to do so, observant to social-distancing and mask-wearing guidance and all other State, County and City mandates. Therefore, there was minimal disruption to Kyle’s business operations during the Idaho’s “stay at home” period. However, during the “stay at home” period, certain key customers of Kyle’s elected to either temporarily stop building homes or delayed their building process, which adversely affected Kyle’s sales. As a result, Kyle’s generated comparatively lower-than-expected sales. Further, during the “stay at home” period, several of Kyle’s employees had taken time off because of medical experiences, and certain of them did not return to employment. Kyle’s has been hiring and training new employees to replace lost productivity because of the aforementioned loss of employees. Kyle’s did not experience any meaningful business interruption related to any of its key suppliers; although recently, potentially as a result of the pandemic and resulting impact, Kyle’s has seen price increases in certain key raw materials such as wood products and hardware. These increases may negatively affect Kyle’s profitability and financial condition. Kyle’s endeavors to best observe guidance from the State of Idaho and to provide a safe working environment to its employees. If the pandemic is not sufficiently contained, it may continue to negatively affect Kyle’s ability to generate sales opportunities and to hire productive employees, as well as impact the cost of raw materials. Therefore, Kyle’s business operations may experience further delays and experience lost sales opportunities and increased costs, which could further adversely impact Kyle’s profitability and financial condition.
In Iowa, where Neese is located, non-essential businesses in certain counties, include where Neese’s principal office is located, began re-opening on May 1, 2020, but the pandemic has had a negative effect on business activity throughout Iowa. Neese is also dependent upon suppliers to provide it with all of the equipment and parts that it sells, and several have notified it of disruptions to their production and/or supply chain related to the pandemic. Any business disruption or failure of these suppliers to meet delivery requirements and commitments may cause delays in future shipments and potential lost or delayed revenue.
We have taken steps to take care of our employees, including providing the ability for employees to work remotely and implementing strategies to support appropriate social distancing techniques for those employees who are not able to work remotely. We have also taken precautions with regard to employee, facility and office hygiene as well as implementing significant travel restrictions. We are also assessing our business continuity plans for all business units in the context of the pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation, and we will continue to monitor and mitigate developments affecting our workforce, our suppliers, our customers, and the public at large to the extent we are able to do so. We have and will continue to carefully review all rules, regulations, and orders and responding accordingly.
If the current pace of the pandemic cannot be slowed and the spread of the virus is not contained, our business operations could be further delayed or interrupted. We expect that government and health authorities may announce new or extend existing restrictions, which could require us to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions. We may also experience limitations in employee resources. In addition, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees were suspected of having the virus, which could require quarantine of some or all such employees or closure of our facilities for disinfection. The duration of any business disruption cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our ability to operate our business and result in additional costs.
The extent to which the pandemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date of this report, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and steps taken to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others. Nevertheless, the pandemic and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in the global supply chain and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Garden Signing
On February 9, 2021, 1847 Hydroponic entered into a securities purchase agreement with the Garden Companies and the sellers named therein, pursuant to which 1847 Hydroponic agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other equity securities of the Garden Companies for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000, subject to adjustment, consisting of (i) $90,000,000 in cash and (ii) a three-year 8% secured subordinated convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000. The closing of the securities purchase agreement is subject to standard closing conditions and has not yet been completed.
Wolo Closing
On March 30, 2021, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary 1847 Wolo acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Wolo for an aggregate purchase price of $7,400,000 (subject to adjustment) consisting of (i) $6,550,000 in cash and (ii) the issuance of a 6% secured promissory note in the principal amount of $850,000.
The purchase price is subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment provision. Under this provision, the sellers of Wolo (who we refer to as the Wolo Sellers) delivered to 1847 Wolo at the closing an unaudited balance sheet of Wolo as of that date. On or before the 75th day following the closing, 1847 Wolo shall deliver to the Wolo Sellers an audited balance sheet as of the closing date. If the net working capital reflected on such final balance sheet exceeds the net working capital reflected on the preliminary balance sheet delivered at closing, 1847 Wolo shall, within seven days, pay to the Wolo Sellers an amount of cash that is equal to such excess. If the net working capital reflected on the preliminary balance sheet exceeds the net working capital reflected on the final balance, the Wolo Sellers shall, within seven days, pay to 1847 Wolo an amount in cash equal to such excess.
6% Secured Promissory Note
As noted above, a portion of the purchase price for Wolo was paid by the issuance of a 6% secured promissory note in the principal amount of $850,000 by 1847 Wolo to the Wolo Sellers. Interest on the outstanding principal amount will be payable quarterly at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum. The note matures on the 39-month anniversary following the closing of the acquisition, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the note, along with all accrued, but unpaid interest, shall be paid in one lump sum. 1847 Wolo has the right to prepay all or any portion of the note at any time prior to the maturity date without premium or penalty of any kind. The note contains customary events of default and is secured by all of the assets of Wolo; provided that the rights of the Wolo Sellers under the note are subordinate to the rights of Sterling National Bank under the credit agreement described below.
Credit Agreement and Notes
On March 30, 2021, 1847 Wolo and Wolo entered into a credit agreement with Sterling National Bank, or Sterling, for (i) revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount that will not exceed the lesser of the borrowing base (as defined below) or $1,000,000 and (ii) a term loan in the principal amount of $3,550,000. The revolving loan is evidenced by a revolving credit note and the term loan is evidenced by a $3,550,000 term note. The “borrowing base” means an amount equal to the sum of the following: (A) 80% of eligible accounts (as defined in the credit agreement) PLUS (B) the lesser of: (1) 50% percent of eligible inventory (as defined in the credit agreement) or (2) $400,000.00, MINUS (C) such reserves as Sterling may establish from time to time in its sole discretion.

The revolving note matures on March 29, 2022 and bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate (as defined in the credit agreement) or (ii) 3.75%. The term note matures on April 1, 2024 and bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (x) the prime rate plus 3.00% or (y) 5.00%; provided that, upon an event of default, all loans, all past due interest and all fees shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the foregoing rate plus 5.00%. Interest accrued on the revolving note and the term note shall be payable on the first day of each month commencing on the first such day of the first month following the making of such revolving loan or term loan, as applicable.
With respect to the term loan, 1847 Wolo and Wolo must repay to Sterling on the first day of each month, (i) beginning on May 1, 2021 and ending on March 1, 2022, eleven (11) equal monthly principal payments of $43,750 each, (ii) beginning on April 1, 2022 and ending on March 1, 2024, twenty-four (24) equal monthly payments of $59,167 each and (iii) on April 1, 2024, a final principal payment in the amount of $1,648,742.

If Sterling has not received the full amount of any monthly payment on or before the date it is due (including as a result of funds not available to be automatically debited on the date on which any such payment is due), 1847 Wolo and Wolo must pay a late fee in an amount equal to six percent (6%) of such overdue payment. 1847 Wolo and Wolo may at any time and from time to time voluntarily prepay the revolving note or the term note in whole or in part.
The credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative financial and other covenants and events of default for loans of this type.

Segments
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires that an enterprise report selected information about reportable segments in its financial reports issued to its stockholders. Beginning with the second quarter of 2019, we changed our operating and reportable segments from one segment to two segments - the retail and appliances segment, which is operated by Asien’s (and was previously operated by Goedeker), and the land management segment, which is operated by Neese. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2020, we added an additional segment - the construction segment, which is operated by Kyle’s.
We provide general corporate services to our segments; however, these services are not considered when making operating decisions and assessing segment performance. These include costs associated with executive management, financing activities and public company compliance.
Discontinued Operations
On October 23, 2020, we distributed all of the shares of Goedeker that we held to our shareholders. As a result of this distribution, Goedeker is no longer a subsidiary of our company. All financial information of Goedeker previously presented as part of retail and appliance services operations are classified as discontinued operations and not presented as part of continuing operations.

Our total general and administrative expenses were $4,185,442 for the year ended December 31, 2020, including $1,362,169 from Asien’s for the period from May 29, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and $254,630 from Kyle’s for the period from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, as compared to our total general and administrative expenses of $1,569,149 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and administrative expenses for the retail and appliances segment was $1,362,169 for the period from May 29, 2020 to December 31, 2020. As a percentage of retail and appliances revenue, general and administrative expenses for the retail and appliances segment was 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
General and administrative expenses for the construction segment was $394,167 for the period from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. As a percentage of construction revenue, general and administrative expenses for the construction segment was 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase primarily resulted from an increase in general and administrative costs of $206,610, offset by a decrease in repair and maintenance of $76,104 and professional fees of $5,203. As a percentage of land management services revenue, general and administrative expenses for the land management services segment was 22.9% and 22.1% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
General and administrative expenses for our holding company increased by $734,654, or 455.0%, to $896,095 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $161,441 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to an increase in professional fees compared to the prior year and issuance of stock-based compensation in the current year of $523,936.
Total other income (expense). We had $941,837 in total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to other expense, net, of $498,577 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other expense, net, in the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of financing costs of $205,075, loss on extinguishment of debt of $382,681, interest expense of $460,559 and other expense of $24,271, offset by a gain on sale of fixed assets of $130,749, while total other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of financing costs of $32,400 interest expense of $523,780, offset by a gain on sale of fixed assets of $57,603.
Net loss from continuing operations. As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net loss from continuing operations was $3,032,612 for the year ended December 31, 2020, including $431,641 from Asien’s for the period from May 29, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and $380,499 from Kyle’s for the period from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, as compared to a net loss of $1,313,271 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,393,368 and restricted cash of $403,811. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from operations, cash proceeds from financing activities, borrowings, and equity contributions by our shareholders.
Although we do not believe that we will require additional cash to continue our operations over the next twelve months (i.e., we do not believe that there is a going concern issue), we do believe additional funds are required to execute our business plan and our strategy of acquiring additional businesses. The funds required to execute our business plan will depend on the size, capital structure and purchase price consideration that the seller of a target business deems acceptable in a given transaction. The amount of funds needed to execute our business plan also depends on what portion of the purchase price of a target business the seller of that business is willing to take in the form of seller notes or our equity or in one of our subsidiaries. Given these factors, we believe that the amount of outside additional capital necessary to execute our business plan on the low end (assuming target company sellers accept a significant portion of the purchase price in the form of seller notes or our equity or in one of our subsidiaries) ranges between $100,000 to $250,000. If, and to the extent, that sellers are unwilling to accept a significant portion of the purchase price in seller notes and equity, then the cash required to execute our business plan could be as much as $5,000,000. We will seek growth as funds become available from cash flow, borrowings, additional capital raised privately or publicly, or seller retained financing.
Our primary use of funds will be for future acquisitions, public company expenses including regular distributions to our shareholders, investments in future acquisitions, payments to our manager pursuant to the management services agreement, potential payment of profit allocation to our manager and potential put price to our manager in respect of the allocation shares it owns. The management fee, expenses, potential profit allocation and potential put price are paid before distributions to shareholders and may be significant and exceed the funds we hold, which may require us to dispose of assets or incur debt to fund such expenditures. See Item 1. “Business-Our Manager” for more information concerning the management fee, the profit allocation and put price.
The amount of management fee paid to our manager by us is reduced by the aggregate amount of any offsetting management fees, if any, received by our manager from any of our businesses. As a result, the management fee paid to our manager may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The amount of management fee paid to our manager may represent a significant cash obligation. In this respect, the payment of the management fee will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.
Our manager, as holder of 100% of our allocation shares, is entitled to receive a twenty percent (20%) profit allocation as a form of preferred equity distribution, subject to an annual hurdle rate of eight percent (8%), as follows. Upon the sale of a company subsidiary, our manager will be paid a profit allocation if the sum of (i) the excess of the gain on the sale of such subsidiary over a high water mark plus (ii) the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition by our company exceeds the 8% hurdle rate. The 8% hurdle rate is the product of (i) a 2% rate per quarter, multiplied by (ii) the number of quarters such subsidiary was held by our company, multiplied by (iii) the subsidiary’s average share (determined based on gross assets, generally) of our consolidated net equity (determined according to GAAP with certain adjustments). In certain circumstances, after a subsidiary has been held for at least 5 years, our manager may also trigger a profit allocation with respect to such subsidiary (determined based solely on the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition). The amount of profit allocation may represent a significant cash payment and is senior in right to payments of distributions to our shareholders. Therefore, the amount of profit allocation paid, when paid, will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operating and investing activities, including future acquisitions. See Item 1. “Business-Our Manager-Our Manager as an Equity Holder-Manager’s Profit Allocation” for more information on the calculation of the profit allocation.
Our operating agreement also contains a supplemental put provision, which gives our manager the right, subject to certain conditions, to cause us to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement. The amount of put price under the supplemental put provision is determined by assuming all of our subsidiaries are sold at that time for their fair market value and then calculating the amount of profit allocation would be payable in such a case. If the management services agreement is terminated for any reason other than our manager’s resignation, the payment to our manager could be as much as twice the amount of such hypothetical profit allocation. As is the case with profit allocation, the calculation of the put price is complex and based on many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. See Item 1. “Business-Our Manager-Our Manager as an Equity Holder-Supplemental Put Provision” for more information on the calculation of the put price. The put price obligation, if our manager exercises its put right, will represent a significant cash payment and is senior in right to payments of distributions to our shareholders. Therefore, the amount of put price will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operating and investing activities, including future acquisitions.

Debt
Holdings
On January 3, 2018, we issued a grid promissory note to our manager in the initial principal amount of $50,000. The note provided that we could request additional advances from our manager up to an aggregate additional amount of $150,000. On December 7, 2020, parties amended and restated the note for a new principal amount of $56,900 and maturity date of December 7, 2021. Interest on the note accrues on the unpaid portion of the principal amount and the outstanding portion of all advances at a fixed rate of 8% per annum. If all or a portion of the principal amount or any advance under the note, or any interest payable thereon is not paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum. In the event that we complete a financing that includes an uplisting of our common shares to a national exchange, then we must, contemporaneously with the closing of such financing transaction, repay the entire outstanding principal, outstanding advances, and accrued and unpaid interest on the note. The note is unsecured and contains customary events of default. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our manager has advanced $56,900 and $119,400 of the note and we have accrued interest of $25,159 and $17,115, respectively.
Neese/Neese
Home State Bank
On June 13, 2018, Neese entered into a term loan agreement with Home State Bank, pursuant to which Neese issued a promissory note to Home State Bank in the principal amount of $3,654,074 with an annual interest rate of 6.85% and with covenants to maintain a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.25 measured at December 31, 2020. Neese met this covenant for the year ended December 31, 2020. On July 30, 2020, Neese entered into a change in terms agreement with Home State Bank to amend the terms of the term loan. Pursuant to the change in terms agreement: (i) the maturity date was extended to July 30, 2022; (ii) the interest rate was changed to 5.50%; (iii) Neese agreed to pay accrued interest in the amount of $95,970.42; (iv) Neese agreed to make payments of $30,000 beginning on September 30, 2020 and continuing thereafter on a monthly basis until maturity, at which time a final interest payment is due; (v) Neese agreed to make a payment of $260,000 on December 30, 2020 and December 30, 2021; (vi) Neese agreed to make two new advances under the note in the amounts $51,068.19 and $517,528.86 to repay in full Neese’s capital lease transactions due to Utica Leaseco LLC; (vii) Neese agreed to pay a loan fee of $17,500; and (viii) Home State Bank agreed to make a loan advance to checking for $17,500. The balance of the note amounts to $3,225,320, comprised of principal of $3,239,175, net of unamortized debt discount of $13,855 as of December 31, 2020.
The loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default. Upon an event of default, the interest rate on the note will be increased by 3 percentage points. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the maximum interest rate limitations under applicable law. The loan is secured by inventory, accounts receivable, and certain fixed assets of Neese. The loan agreement limited the payment of interest on the 10% promissory note described below to $40,000 annually. We continue to accrue interest at the contractual amounts. Such accruals (in excess of $40,000 in interest on the promissory note) are shown as long-term accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.
If we sell property, plant, and equipment securing the loan, we must remit the appraised value of the equipment to Home State Bank. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0 and $30,500, respectively, was remitted to Home State Bank pursuant to this requirement.
We adopted ASU 2015-03 by deducting debt issuance costs from the long-term portion of the loan. Amortization of the Home State Bank debt issuance costs totaled $15,513 and $18,645 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
10% Promissory Note
A portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Neese was paid by the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,025,000 by 1847 Neese and Neese to the sellers of Neese (who we refer to as the Neese Sellers). The note bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum and was due and payable in full on March 3, 2018. The note is unsecured and contains customary events of default. The note has not been repaid, so we are in default under this note. Under terms of the term loan with Home State Bank described above, this note may not be paid until the term loan is paid in full. The Neese Sellers agreed to the modification of its terms by signing the loan agreement for the Home State Bank term loan. Accordingly, the loan is shown as a long-term liability as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, Home State Bank limits the payment of interest on this note to $40,000 annually. We continue to accrue interest at the contract rate; however, given the limitations of the term loan, all accrued interest in excess of $40,000 is included in long-term accrued expenses.
Asien/Asien’s
Arvest Bank
On July 10, 2020, Asien’s entered into a promissory note and security agreement with Arvest Bank for a revolving loan for up to $400,000. The loan matures on July 10, 2021 and bears interest at 5.25% per annum, subject to change in accordance with the Variable Rate (as defined in the promissory note and security agreement), the calculation for which is the U.S. Prime Rate plus 2%. Pursuant to the terms of the promissory note and security agreement, Asien’s is required to make monthly payments beginning on August 10, 2020 and until the maturity date, at which time all unpaid principal and interest will be due. Asien’s may prepay the loan in full or in part at any time without penalty. The promissory note and security agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for a loan of this type. The loan is secured by Asien’s inventory and equipment, accounts and other rights of payments, and general intangibles, as such terms are defined in the Uniform Commercial Code. The remaining principal balance of the note at December 31, 2020 is $301,081 and it has accrued interest of $995.

A portion of the purchase price for acquisition of Asien’s was paid by the issuance of an 8% subordinated amortizing promissory note in the principal amount of $200,000 by 1847 Asien to the seller of Asien’s (which we refer to as the Asien’s Seller). Interest on the outstanding principal amount will be payable quarterly at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. The outstanding principal amount of the note will amortize on a one-year straight-line basis in accordance with a specified amortization schedule, with all unpaid principal and accrued, but unpaid interest being fully due and payable on May 28, 2021. The note contains customary events of default.

Cabinet/Kyle’s
Vesting Promissory Note
A portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Kyle’s on September 30, 2020 was paid by the issuance of a vesting promissory note by 1847 Cabinet to the sellers of Kyle’s (which we refer to as the Kyle’s Sellers) in the principal amount of $1,050,000, which increased to a principal amount of up to $1,260,000 pursuant to the vested percentage calculation described below. Payment of the principal and accrued interest on the note is subject to vesting as described below. The note bears interest on the vested portion of principal amount at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. To the extent vested, the vested portion of the principal and all accrued but unpaid interest on such vested portion of the principal shall be paid in one lump sum on the last day of the thirty-sixth (36th) month following the date of the note.
The vested principal of the note due at the maturity date shall be calculated each year based on the average annual consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the note) of 1847 Cabinet for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The EBITDA for each year shall be divided by $1.4 million multiplied by 100 to obtain the vested percentage. The vested principal for each year shall be equal to the vested percentage for that year multiplied by $350,000. To the extent that the vested percentage for the subject year is less than 80%, no portion of the note for that year shall vest. To the extent that the vested percentage for the subject year is equal to or greater than 120%, the vested principal shall be equal to $420,000 for that year and no more. For the year ended December 31, 2020, EBITDA of 1847 Cabinet was approximately $1,531,000, resulting in a vested amount of approximately $415,000.
Cabinet will have the right to redeem all but no less than all of the note at any time prior to the maturity date. If 1847 Cabinet elects to redeem the note, the redemption price will be payable in cash and is equal to the then outstanding vested portion of the principal plus any remaining unvested principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon (calculated over 36 months). For purposes of this redemption calculation, the “unvested principal amount” shall be $350,000 per year.
The note contains customary events of default. The right of the Kyle’s Sellers to receive payments under the note is subordinated to all indebtedness of 1847 Cabinet, whether outstanding as of the closing date or thereafter created, to banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions or funds, and federal or state taxation authorities.
Intercompany Secured Promissory Note
In connection with the acquisition of Kyle’s, we provided 1847 Cabinet with the funds necessary to pay the cash portion of the purchase price and cover acquisition expenses. In connection therewith, on September 30, 2020, 1847 Cabinet issued a secured promissory note to our company in the principal amount of $4,525,000, which was amended and restated on December 11, 2020. Pursuant to such amendment and restatement, if and to the extent any amounts are owing under the units described under “-Unit Offering” above, due to a default or redemption, in addition to payment obligations due under the note, 1847 Cabinet is required to immediately make payments to us so that we may make any required payments in compliance with the terms of the units. The note bears interest at the rate of 16% per annum. The interest is cumulative and any unpaid accrued interest will compound on each anniversary date of the note. Interest is due and payable in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 commencing January 15, 2021. In the event payment of principal or interest due under the note is not made when due, giving effect to any grace period which may be applicable, or in the event of any other default (as defined in the note), the outstanding principal balance shall from the date of default immediately bear interest at the rate of 5% above the then applicable interest rate for so long as such default continues. We may demand payment in full of the note at any time, even if 1847 Cabinet has complied with all of the terms of the note; and the note shall be due in full, without demand, upon a third party sale of all or substantially all the assets and business of 1847 Cabinet or a third party sale or other disposition of any capital stock of 1847 Cabinet. 1847 Cabinet may prepay the note at any time without penalty. The note contains customary events of default, is guaranteed by Kyle’s and is secured by all of the assets of 1847 Cabinet and Kyle’s. The remaining principal balance of the note at December 31, 2020 is $4,525,000 and it has accrued interest of $182,488.
PPP Loans
On April 10, 2020 and April 28, 2020, Neese and Asien’s received $383,600 and $357,500, respectively, in Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loans from the United States Small Business Administration, or the SBA, under provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. The PPP loans have two-year terms and bear interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. Monthly principal and interest payments are deferred for six months after the date of disbursement. The PPP loans may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The PPP loans contain events of default and other provisions customary for loans of this type. The PPP provides that the PPP loans may be partially or wholly forgiven if the funds are used for certain qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act. Neese and Asien’s intend to use the proceeds from the PPP loans for qualifying expenses and to apply for forgiveness of the PPP loans in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. We have classified $741,100 of the PPP loans as long-term liabilities upon receiving SBA forgiveness of the loans in early 2021.
Total Debt
The following table shows aggregate figures for the total debt described above that is coming due in the short and long term as of December 31, 2020. See the above disclosures for more details regarding these loans.
(a) net of valuation adjustment of $551,021
Contractual Obligations
We have engaged our manager to manage our day-to-day operations and affairs. Our relationship with our manager will be governed principally by the following agreements:
● the management services agreement and offsetting management services agreements relating to the management services our manager will perform for us and the businesses we own and the management fee to be paid to our manager in respect thereof; and
● our operating agreement setting forth our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares it owns, including the right to receive profit allocations from us, and the supplemental put provision relating to our manager’s right to cause us to purchase the allocation shares it owns.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our consolidated company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:
Revenue Recognition and Cost of Revenue
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer purchase orders, including significant judgments. Our adoption of this ASU resulted in no change to our results of operations or balance sheet.
Retail and Appliances Segment
Asien’s collects 100% of the payment for special-order models including tax and 50% of the payment for non-special orders from the customer at the time the order is placed. Asien’s does not incur incremental costs obtaining purchase orders from customers, however, if Asien’s did, because all Asien’s contracts are less than a year in duration, any contract costs incurred would be expensed rather than capitalized.
Performance Obligations - The revenue that Asien’s recognizes arises from orders it receives from customers. Asien’s performance obligations under the customer orders correspond to each sale of merchandise that it makes to customers under the purchase orders; as a result, each purchase order generally contains only one performance obligation based on the merchandise sale to be completed. Control of the delivery transfers to customers when the customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the benefits from, Asien’s products, which generally occurs when the customer assumes the risk of loss. The transfer of control generally occurs at the point of pickup, shipment, or installation. Once this occurs, Asien’s has satisfied its performance obligation and Asien’s recognizes revenue.
Transaction Price - Asien’s agrees with customers on the selling price of each transaction. This transaction price is generally based on the agreed upon sales price. In Asien’s contracts with customers, it allocates the entire transaction price to the sales price, which is the basis for the determination of the relative standalone selling price allocated to each performance obligation. Any sales tax that Asien’s collects concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
Cost of revenue includes the cost of purchased merchandise plus freight and any applicable delivery charges from the vendor to Asien’s. Substantially all Asien’s sales are to individual retail consumers (homeowners), builders and designers. The large majority of customers are homeowners and their contractors, with the homeowner being key in the final decisions. Asien’s has a diverse customer base with no one client accounting for more than 5% of total revenue.
Land Management Segment
Neese’s payment terms are due on demand from acceptance of delivery. Neese does not incur incremental costs obtaining purchase orders from customers, however, if Neese did, because all of Neese’s contracts are less than a year in duration, any contract costs incurred would be expensed rather than capitalized.
The revenue that Neese recognizes arises from orders it receives from customers. Neese’s performance obligations under the customer orders correspond to each service delivery or sale of equipment that Neese makes to customers under the purchase orders; as a result, each purchase order generally contains only one performance obligation based on the service or equipment sale to be completed. Control of the delivery transfers to customers when the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, Neese’s products, which generally occurs at the later of when the customer obtains title to the equipment or when the customer assumes risk of loss. The transfer of control generally occurs at a point of delivery. Once this occurs, Neese has satisfied its performance obligation and Neese recognizes revenue.
Neese also sells equipment by posting it on auction sites specializing in farm equipment. Neese posts the equipment for sale on a “magazine” site for several weeks before the auction. When Neese decides to sell, it moves the equipment to the auction site. The auctions are one day. If Neese accepts a bid, the customer pays the bid price and arranges for pick-up of the equipment.
Transaction Price - Neese agrees with customers on the selling price of each transaction. This transaction price is generally based on the agreed upon service fee. In Neese’s contracts with customers, it allocates the entire transaction price to the service fee to the customer, which is the basis for the determination of the relative standalone selling price allocated to each performance obligation. Any sales tax, value added tax, and other tax Neese collects concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
If Neese continued to apply legacy revenue recognition guidance for year ended December 31, 2020, revenues, gross margin, and net loss would not have changed.
Substantially all of Neese’s sales are to businesses, including farmers or municipalities and very little to individuals.
Disaggregated Revenue - Neese disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by contract type, as it believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
Performance Obligations - Performance obligations for the different types of services are discussed below:
● Trucking - Revenues for time and material contracts are recognized when the merchandise or commodity is delivered to the destination specified in the agreement with the customer.
● Waste Hauling and pumping - Revenues for waste hauling and pumping is recognized when the hauling, pumping, and spreading are complete.
● Repairs - Revenues for repairs are recognized upon completion of equipment serviced.
● Sales of parts and equipment - Revenues for the sale of parts and equipment are recognized upon the transfer and acceptance by the customer.
Accounts Receivable, Net - Accounts receivable, net, are amounts due from customers where there is an unconditional right to consideration. Unbilled receivables of $38,000 and $121,989 are included in this balance at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The payment of consideration related to these unbilled receivables is subject only to the passage of time.
Neese reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. Estimates are used to determine the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts necessary to reduce accounts receivable to its estimated net realizable value. The estimates are based on an analysis of past due receivables, historical bad debt trends, current economic conditions, and customer specific information. After Neese has exhausted all collection efforts, the outstanding receivable balance relating to services provided is written off against the allowance. Additions to the provision for bad debt are charged to expense.
Neese determined that an allowance for loss of $14,614 and $29,001 was required at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Construction Segment
Kyle’s generates revenues from providing cabinet design, construction and installation primary from cabinet-related products and supplies.
Kyle’s provides cabinet design, construction and installation services to customers with both residential and commercial projects. A majority of Kyle’s contracts are recurring work from a builder team. Kyle’s will provide pricing and work with individual homeowners, designers and builders to determine pricing options and upgrades to the base proposed contact pricing.
Performance Obligations - For substantially all landscaping construction contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, on a percentage completion basis on a total project cost basis. Typical contacts will last approximately 4-6 weeks from start to the substantial completion of the project.
Significant Judgments and Estimates - For cabinet construction contracts, measuring the percent completion on an individual project requires estimates obtained by discussions with field personnel. Estimates are also used in determining the total estimated total costs of a project. These estimates and assumptions are the best information management has at the time percent complete is calculated. The Company employs the same estimation methodology on a quarterly basis.
Accounts Receivable, Net - Accounts receivable, net, are amounts due from customers where there is an unconditional right to consideration.
Receivables
Receivables consist of credit card transactions in the process of settlement. Vendor rebates receivable represent amounts due from manufactures from whom we purchase products. Rebates receivable are stated at the amount that management expects to collect from manufacturers, net of accounts payable amounts due the vendor. Rebates are calculated on product and model sales programs from specific vendors. The rebates are paid at intermittent periods either in cash or through issuance of vendor credit memos, which can be applied against vendor accounts payable. Based on our assessment of the credit history with our manufacturers, we have concluded that there should be no allowance for uncollectible accounts. We historically collect substantially all of our outstanding rebates receivables. Uncollectible balances are expensed in the period it is determined to be uncollectible.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Provisions for credit losses are charged to income as losses are estimated to have occurred and in amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance for credit losses at an adequate level to provide for future losses on our accounts receivable. We charge credit losses against the allowance and credits subsequent recoveries, if any, to the allowance. Historical loss experience and contractual delinquency of accounts receivables, and management’s judgment are factors used in assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance and the resulting provision for credit losses. While management uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or portfolio performance. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.
The allowance for credit losses consists of general and specific components. The general component of the allowance estimates credit losses for groups of accounts receivable on a collective basis and relates to probable incurred losses of unimpaired accounts receivables. We record a general allowance for credit losses that includes forecasted future credit losses.
Inventory
For Asien’s, inventory mainly consists of appliances that are acquired for resale and is valued at the average cost determined on a specific item basis. Inventory also consists of parts that are used in service and repairs and may or may not be charged to the customer depending on warranty and contractual relationship. For Neese, inventory consists of finished products acquired for resale and is valued at the lower-of-cost-or-market with cost determined on a specific item basis. Kyle’s typically orders inventory on a job-by-job basis and those jobs are put into production within hours of being received. The inventory in production is accounted for in the contact assets and liabilities and follows the percentage completion methodology. Inventories consisting of materials and supplies are stated at lower of costs or market. We periodically evaluate the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs to inventory based on our estimate of market conditions. We estimated an obsolescence allowance of $181,370 and $26,546 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture, vehicles and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
In applying the acquisition method of accounting, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment within one year of acquisitions or annually as of December 1, and whenever indicators of impairment exist. The fair value of intangible assets are compared with their carrying values, and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which a carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
Acquired identifiable intangible assets are amortized over the following periods:
Long-Lived Assets
We review our property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit and amounts due to shareholders. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in our financial statements.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three-level hierarchy is as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market date.
Our held to maturity securities are comprised of certificates of deposit.
Derivative Instrument Liability
We account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts, and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged.
Stock-Based Compensation
We record stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the employees required service period, which is generally the vesting period.
Leases
We adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, on January 1, 2019. The new leasing standard requires recognition of leases on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value and future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we used our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. A number of the lease agreements contain options to renew and options to terminate the leases early. The lease term used to calculate ROU assets and lease liabilities only includes renewal and termination options that are deemed reasonably certain to be exercised.
We recognized lease liabilities, with corresponding ROU assets, based on the present value of unpaid lease payments for existing operating leases longer than twelve months. The ROU assets were adjusted per ASC 842 transition guidance for existing lease-related balances of accrued and prepaid rent, and unamortized lease incentives provided by lessors. Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. We have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for all property leases for the purposes of calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities.
