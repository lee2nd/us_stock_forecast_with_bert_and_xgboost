Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The financial data discussed below is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which are found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The financial data discussed below is only a summary and investors should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Corporate Overview and History
We are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of pharmaceuticals for chronic diseases driven by inflammation. We also have a commercial business unit that markets dietary supplements for inflammatory health. CDX-101, our astaxanthin pharmaceutical candidate, is being developed for cardiovascular inflammation and dyslipidemia, with a target initial indication of severe hypertriglyceridemia. CDX-301, our zeaxanthin pharmaceutical candidate, is being developed for macular degeneration. Our pharmaceutical candidates are currently in pre-clinical development, including the planning of IND enabling studies. ZanthoSyn® is a physician recommended astaxanthin dietary supplement for inflammatory health. We sell ZanthoSyn® primarily through wholesale and e-commerce channels. The safety and efficacy of our products have not been directly evaluated in clinical trials or confirmed by the FDA.
At present we are not able to estimate if or when we will be able to generate sustained revenues. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern; however, given our recurring losses from operations, our independent registered public accounting firm has determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Results of Operations
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table reflects our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Operating Summary
Our revenues presently derive from the sale of ZanthoSyn® primarily through wholesale and, to a lesser extent, e-commerce channels. We launched our e-commerce channel in 2016 and began selling to GNC stores in 2017. ZanthoSyn® is available at GNC corporate stores nationwide. As a result, revenues were $538,946 and $710,949 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributed to decreased sales, which we believe were related to the COVID-19 pandemic and GNC’s Chapter 11 reorganization. Costs of goods sold were $196,130 and $345,393 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and included costs of the product, shipping and handling, sales taxes, merchant fees, and other costs incurred on the sale of goods. Gross profits were $342,816 and $365,556 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which represented gross profit margins of 64% and 51%, respectively.
Operating expenses were $3,405,452 and $4,442,659 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating expenses primarily consisted of services provided to the Company, including payroll, consultation, and contract services, for research and development, including our clinical trial and pharmaceutical development programs, sales and marketing, and administration. These expenses were paid in accordance with agreements entered into with each employee or service provider. Included in operating expenses were $632,500 and $708,588 in stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Other expenses, net, were $1,992,871 and $1,015,934 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expenses, net, primarily consisted of interest expense of $2,384,635, gain on change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $222,707, gain on modification of debt instruments of $394,924, other income of $30,000, loss on the abandonment of patents of $98,056, and loss on the abandonment of pending stock issuance costs of $157,811. For the year ended December 31, 2019, other expenses, net, primarily consisted of interest expense of $623,415, loss on change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $356,314, and loss on the abandonment of patents of $36,205.
Assets and Liabilities
Assets were $1,425,172 and $2,018,922 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash totaled $19,179 and $19,303, respectively. Negative working capital was $9,429,734 and $6,547,114 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was primarily due to accrued payroll and paid time off of $4,362,381 and $3,687,376, accrued Board of Director fees and related consultation of $418,546, accounts payable of $1,689,352 and $1,544,402, and the aggregate current liability related to notes payable, convertible notes payable, and derivative liability on convertible notes payable, of $4,018,292 and $2,412,324, less current assets of $1,121,799 and $1,586,061, respectively. The issuance of convertible notes resulted in derivative liabilities of $235,165 and $827,314 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively; however, these are non-cash amounts and do not directly impact our liquidity or capital needs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have sustained operating losses and have used cash raised by issuing securities. We expect to continue to operate with a net loss until we are able to develop and commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we used cash in operating activities of $1,791,583 and $3,522,837, respectively, and incurred net losses of $5,055,507 and $5,093,037, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a U.S. federal income tax net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward of approximately $46 million. These NOLs may be available to offset our future taxable income to the extent permitted under the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). Under IRC Section 382, the use of NOL carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and other tax credit carryforwards may be significantly limited if a change in ownership of a company occurs. A change in ownership under IRC Section 382 is defined, generally, as a cumulative change of 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning 5% or more of a company’s common stock over a three-year rolling period. If we were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of IRC Section 382, then under certain conditions, our annual federal NOL utilization could be limited to an amount equal to our market capitalization (valued at the time of the ownership change) multiplied by the federal long-term tax exempt rate.
Our existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund our operations, including payroll, anticipated capital expenditures, working capital, and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future. We require additional financing in order to continue to fund our operations and to pay existing and future liabilities and other obligations, and may require more financing than anticipated, especially if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated, or if we experience significant increases in the cost of manufacturing, research and development, or sales and marketing activities, or increases in our expense levels resulting from being a publicly-traded company.
Our working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to:
● revenues from the sale of any products or licenses;
● costs of production, marketing and sales capabilities, or other operating expenses; and
● costs of research, development, and commercialization of our products and technologies.
Our largest customer, GNC, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on June 23, 2020. As a result, we wrote off receivables from GNC in the amount of $69,934 during the year ended December 31, 2020. We cannot predict the extent of the impact that GNC’s reorganization will have on our future sales and receivables. On October 7, 2020, GNC announced it had emerged from bankruptcy as GNC Holdings, LLC, a Delaware company, owned indirectly by Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., a large Chinese pharmaceutical company (“Harbin”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ZT Biopharmaceutical LLC, a Delaware company. Harbin was previously GNC’s largest stockholder and acquired the company for approximately $770 million according to public reports.
We have undertaken certain actions regarding the advancement of our pharmaceutical development program, the conduct of a dietary supplement clinical trial, and the continued sales and marketing of our commercial dietary supplement. We plan to fund such activities, including compensation to service providers, with a combination of cash and equity payments. The amount of payments in cash and equity will be determined by us from time to time.
We will incur ongoing recurring expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal, and other expenses for annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements, and other filings under the Exchange Act. We estimate that these costs will likely be in excess of $250,000 per year. These obligations will reduce our ability and resources to fund other aspects of our business. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate certain independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts.
As of the date hereof, we have outstanding promissory notes that are (i) due in the 2021 calendar year in the aggregate principal amount of $4,031,223, of which $3,262,223 has terms for conversion and/or repayment amortization, (ii) due in the 2022 calendar year in the aggregate principal amount of $1,461,300, of which $250,000 has terms for conversion and/or repayment amortization and $211,300 has terms for forgiveness and otherwise for repayment amortization starting in 2021, and (iii) due in the 2026 calendar year in the aggregate principal amount of $211,359, which has terms for forgiveness and otherwise for repayment amortization starting in 2022. Our ability to repay any and all of these notes as they become due if not otherwise repaid or converted on or prior to the maturity dates described above is uncertain and will be based on our ability to raise additional capital, generate additional revenues, and/or modify the terms of such debt instruments to the extent necessary.
We need additional capital to fund our operations and pay our current and future obligations, including without limitation our outstanding promissory notes; however, our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise raise such capital is unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient amounts of capital as and when needed.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we raised financing of $2,515,300 and $3,360,000, respectively, primarily through the issuance of promissory notes. We intend to raise additional capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months and may seek financing from investors through the issuance of equity, debt, or convertible debt securities. We cannot give any assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms and conditions, or at all.
We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on August 14, 2019, as amended September 27, 2019, and November 22, 2019, for a proposed $15 million public offering of our common stock and warrants and the listing of our common stock and such warrants on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We continued to take actions to advance the proposed public offering in 2020, but due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions, financial market conditions, and other considerations, the public offering was not consummated. In March 2021, we requested withdrawal of the registration statement from the Commission.
In July 2020, we submitted a grant application to a federal government agency to fund a proposed clinical trial with one of our astaxanthin products in COVID-19 patients. In January 2021, we submitted an updated grant application to address the comments received from the agency’s reviewers. We are also pursuing other governmental and non-governmental sources of funding for COVID-19 clinical trials. If awarded, any such grant funding would provide non-dilutive capital, but we cannot give any assurance that we will receive any grant funding or the amount or timing or extent of restrictions thereof or our obligations related thereto.
We recently launched a private placement of our preferred stock for an aggregate amount of up to $10 million, or such other amount as we may determine. The offering may have more than one closing and had an initial closing of $50,000 on January 11, 2021. We cannot give any assurance that additional closings will be consummated in a timely manner, or at all.
Our stockholders may be diluted upon the exercise or conversion of our outstanding warrants, options, preferred stock, and convertible notes, including as previously disclosed, certain of our outstanding notes that have rights to convert into shares of our common stock upon certain dates or events at prices that may cause substantial dilution.
Any inability to obtain additional financing will materially and adversely affect us, including requiring us to significantly curtail or cease business operations altogether. We cannot give any assurance that we will in the future be able to achieve a level of profitability from the sale of existing or future products or otherwise to sustain our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods indicated:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our operating activities primarily consisted of receipts and receivables from sales, payments or accruals for employees, directors, and consultants for services related to administration, sales and marketing, and research and development. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to a combination of decreased operating expenses and increased accruals for accounts payable and accrued payroll.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our investing activities were primarily related to expenditures on patents.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our financing activities consisted of transactions in which we raised proceeds through the issuance of debt and equity securities.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable in the aggregate amount of $1,720,000, the issuance of related party convertible notes payable in the amount of $340,000, the issuance of a forgivable note payable in the amount of $211,300, the issuance of a note payable in the amount of $25,000, and the issuance of related party notes payable in the amount of $219,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid outstanding convertible notes payable in the aggregate amount of $529,228, an outstanding note payable in the amount of $25,000, and an outstanding related party note payable in the amount of $25,000, and we paid debt issuance costs in the aggregate amount of $40,000.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement. This ASU modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the concepts in the FASB’s Concepts Statement, including the consideration of costs and benefits. The guidance in ASU No. 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-08, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The amendments in this Update require that an entity apply the guidance in Topic 718 to measure and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer. The amount recorded as a reduction in the transaction price should be based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment award. The guidance in ASU No. 2019-08 is effective fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB Issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. ASU No. 2020-06 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and adoption must be as of the beginning of the Company’s annual fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
