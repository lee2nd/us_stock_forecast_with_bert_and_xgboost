Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
As used in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,” except where the context otherwise requires, the term “we,” “us,” “our,” or “the Company,” refers to the business of TraQiQ Inc.
Overview
TraQiQ, Inc. (along with its wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to herein as the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of California on September 9, 2009 as Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc. On July 14, 2017, Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc. changed its name to TraQiQ, Inc. On July 19, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange”) with the stockholders of OmniM2M, Inc. (“OmniM2M”) and TraQiQ Solutions, Inc. dba Ci2i Services, Inc. (formerly Ci2i Services, Inc. - amended November 6, 2019) (“Ci2i”) whereby the stockholders of OmniM2M and Ci2i agreed to exchange all of their respective shares, representing 100% ownership in OmniM2M and Ci2i in exchange for 12,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively. The OmniM2M Shareholders and the Ci2i Shareholders have each been issued their respective 12,000,000 shares on a pro rata basis based on their respective holdings in OmniM2M and Ci2i in the Share Exchange Agreement. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse merger whereas Ci2i is considered the accounting acquirer and TraQiQ, Inc. is considered the accounting acquiree. For accounting purposes, the acquisition of OmniM2M is recorded at historical cost in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805-50-25-2 as this is considered an acquisition of entities under common control as the management of the Company and OmniM2M control the activities of the respective companies. Prior to the merger with Ci2i and acquisition of OmniM2M, the Company was considered a shell company under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). On December 1, 2017, The Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Ajay Sikka (“Sikka”), the sole shareholder of Transport IQ, Inc. whereby Sikka agreed to sell all of the shares in TransportIQ, Inc. (“TransportIQ”) in exchange for $18,109, in the form of cancellation of all of the debt of TransportIQ that is owed to the Company. The transaction became effective upon the execution of the Share Exchange Agreement by Sikka and the Company; and Transport IQ, Inc, is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Because TransportIQ was commonly controlled and owned, the transaction was recorded at the historical carrying value of TransportIQ’s assets and liabilities.
Ci2i is an innovative and growth-oriented services company founded in 1998 that develops and deploys intelligent technologies and products in order to meet the demand for sustainable, integrated solutions to contemporary business needs. The primary focus has been in the Analytics and Intelligence segments. The Company is investing significantly in building products in the area of supply chain and last mile delivery.
On May 16, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with TRAQIQ Solutions Private Limited. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement with TRAQ Pvt Ltd., the Company acquired 100% of the shares of TRAQ Pvt Ltd. and assumed certain net liabilities in exchange for warrants exercisable over a five-years to purchase 1,329,272 shares of common stock of the Company valued at $268. The warrants will be exercisable as follows: (i) 100,771 warrants immediately upon closing; (ii) 859,951 warrants exercisable one-year after the date of closing; and (iii) 368,550 warrants exercisable two-years after the date of closing. This transaction is being recorded as a business combination under ASC 805.
The warrants that are exercisable in one-year and two-years are conditioned upon TRAQ Pvt Ltd. achieving certain revenue figures and pre-tax profit percentages. TRAQ Pvt Ltd. must achieve target revenue of $1.1 million (US$) and pre-tax profit of 25% (US$). Should TRAQ Pvt Ltd. be unable to achieve these criteria, the warrants will be reduced proportionately.
Effective December 31, 2020, Ci2i acquired the net assets of OmniM2M and TransportIQ, and then dissolved those entities in January 2021. The value of those transactions were for the assumed liabilities of Omni and TransportIQ, and no cash was exchanged.
Going Concern
The Company has an accumulated deficit of $2,504,893 and a working capital deficit of $2,851,721 as of December 31, 2020 compared to a working capital deficit of $2,697,036 as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and/or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity or debt financing to continue operations, successfully locating and negotiating with other business entities for potential acquisition and /or acquiring new clients to generate revenues.
In May 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of TRAQ Pvt Ltd. and assumed certain net liabilities in exchange for warrants exercisable over a five-years to purchase 1,329,272 shares of common stock of the Company valued at $268. This acquisition will assist the Company in operations and cash flow.
In order to further implement its business plan and satisfy its working capital requirements, the Company will need to raise additional capital. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, if at all.
There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Those material accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed immediately below and are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates include, but are not limited to, management’s estimate of provisions required for non-collectible accounts receivable, depreciative lives of our assets, determination of technological feasibility, and valuation allowances of our deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Capitalized Software Costs
In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance regarding the development of software to be sold, leased, or marketed, the Company expenses such costs as they are incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at and after which time these costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Once the technological feasibility is established per ASC 985-20, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the acquisition or development of major software for internal and external use in the balance sheet. Costs incurred to enhance the Company’s software products, after general market release of the services using the products, is expensed in the period they are incurred. The Company only capitalizes subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internally developed software to the extent that such changes allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. The Company expenses software maintenance and training costs as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), specifically ASC 606-10-50-12. This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. The updated guidance introduces a five-step model to achieve its core principal of the entity recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method, however the new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations, as it did not change the manner or timing of recognizing revenue.
Professional Service Revenue
TRAQ Pvt Ltd. generally derives a large part of its revenues from professional and support services, which includes revenue generated from software development projects and associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers using their systems. Revenue from arrangements with customers is recognized based on the Company’s satisfaction of distinct performance obligations identified in each agreement, generally at a point in time as discussed in ASC 606. In instances where multiple performance obligations are identified, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative selling prices of each distinct product or service, and recognizes revenue related to each performance obligation at the points in time that each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s performance obligation includes providing customization of software’s, selling of licenses, where the Company typically satisfies its performance obligations prior to the submission of invoices to the customer for such services. The Company’s performance obligation for consulting and technical support is delivered on as the work is being performed, which is satisfied prior to invoicing. The Company generally collects payment within 30 to 60 days of completion of the performance obligation and there are no agency relationships.
Software development arrangements involving significant customization, modification or production are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate technical accounting guidance issued by the FASB using the percentage-of- completion method. The Company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee.
Unbilled revenue represents earnings in excess of billings as at the end of the reporting period. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the statements of operations.
TRAQ Pvt Ltd. has deferred the revenue and costs attributable to certain process transition activities with respect to its customers where such activities do not represent the culmination of a separate earnings process. Such revenue and costs are subsequently recognized ratably over the period in which the related services are performed. Further, the deferred costs are limited to the amount of the deferred revenues.
TRAQ Pvt Ltd. has now started offering an integrated solution for supply chain and last mile. This product called “TraQSuite” is now offered in multiple markets as a cloud-based subscription offering. This is a significant improvement from the earlier professional services business.
Software Solution Revenue
Revenue from arrangements with customers is recognized based on the Company’s satisfaction of distinct performance obligations identified in each agreement, generally at a point in time as discussed in ASC 606. In instances where multiple performance obligations are identified, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative selling prices of each distinct product or service, and recognizes revenue related to each performance obligation at the points in time that each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s performance obligation includes providing connectivity to software, generally through a monthly subscription, where the Company typically satisfies its performance obligations prior to the submission of invoices to the customer for such services. The Company’s performance obligation for hardware components that are purchased by the customer in connection with the solution is delivery of the purchased device, which is satisfied prior to invoicing. The Company provides a twelve-month warranty on their hardware. All units deployed by the Company are past the twelve-month period, thus the Company has not accrued for a warranty liability. The Company generally collects payment within 30 to 60 days of completion of the performance obligation and there are no agency relationships.
Costs of Services Provided
Costs of services provided consist of data processing costs, customer support costs including personnel costs to maintain the Company’s proprietary databases, costs to provide customer call center support, hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems and exchanges, telecommunication and computer network expense, and occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed. Depreciation expense is not included in costs of services provided.
Foreign Currency Transactions
The Company accounts for foreign currency transactions in accordance with ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters” (“ASC 830”), specifically the guidance in subsection ASC 830-20, “Foreign Currency Transactions”. The U.S. dollar is the functional and reporting currency for the Company and its subsidiaries other than TRAQ Pvt Ltd. whose functional currency is the Indian Rupee. Pursuant to ASC 830, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses upon settlement reported in foreign exchange gain (loss) in the computation of net income (loss). Gains or losses resulting from translation adjustments are reported under accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company follows ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. This requires recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” approach. Management evaluates their tax positions on an annual basis.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and various state tax jurisdictions. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they were filed.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” requires the Company to disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below for the Company’s financial instruments: The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, stockholder advances, and short-term financing approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) include additional dilution from common stock equivalents, such as convertible notes, preferred stock, stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and warrants. Common stock equivalents are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share when the Company reports a loss because to do so would be anti-dilutive for periods presented. An uncertain number of shares underlying convertible debt have been excluded from the computation of loss per share because their impact was anti-dilutive.
Related Party Transactions
Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal stockholders of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal stockholders of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal where one-party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as compensation or distribution to related parties depending on the transaction.
Lease Obligations
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, less current portion in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For leases in which the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.
