Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This discussion presents management’s analysis of the financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements.
Overview
We are a bank holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Our commercial community banking activities are operated through Open Bank, our banking subsidiary. We offer commercial banking services to small and medium-sized businesses, their owners and retail customers primarily in the Korean-American community.
Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. We drive our income from interest received on our loan portfolio and the fee income we receive in connection with our deposits and the sale and service of SBA loans. Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits, the salaries and related benefits we pay our management and staff and the rent we pay on our leased properties. We rely primarily on locally-generated deposits, mostly from the Korean-American market within California, to fund our loan activities. We currently operate seven branches in Los Angeles County and Orange County, one branch in Santa Clara County, and one branch in Carrollton, Texas. We have four loan production offices in Atlanta, Georgia, Aurora, Colorado, and Lynnwood and Seattle, Washington.
As of December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $1.37 billion, gross loans of $1.10 billion, total deposits of $1.20 billion, and total consolidated shareholders’ equity of $143.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded net income of $13.1 million, $16.8 million, and $14.3 million, respectively.
The following significant items are of note for the year ended December 31, 2020:
•
Net income totaled $13.1 million or $0.85 per diluted common share for 2020, compared to $16.8 million or $1.03 per diluted common share for 2019
•
Net interest income increased to $45.4 million, up 2.5% from $44.3 million for 2019
•
Total assets of $1.37 billion, a 15.9% increase over 2020
•
Gross loans of $1.10 billion, a 11.1% increase over 2020
•
Total deposits of $1.20 billion, a 17.6% increase over 2020
•
Shareholders’ equity of $143.4 million, a 2.0% increase over 2020
COVID-19 AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant, unprecedented disruption around the world that has affected daily living and negatively impacted the local, state, national and global economies. The pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in many states and communities. This has increased unemployment levels and caused extreme volatility in the financial markets. While COVID-19 has negatively impacted the economy, the CARES Act provided for financial stimulus and government lending programs at unprecedented levels. The benefits of these programs, as well as any potential additional stimulus, to effectively support businesses and consumers within the economy are uncertain.
The Company was able to react quickly to these changes because of the commitment and flexibility of its workforce coupled with a well-prepared business continuity plan. The Company has taken various steps to help our customers, employees, and communities, while maintaining safe and sound banking operations. The Company has been assisting customers with loan deferrals and the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans and has provided employees remote working environment while maintaining fully functioning operations in all areas. Since the pandemic has begun, the Company donated $1.0 million through the Open Stewardship Foundation to support small restaurants in the communities we serve. The Company also donated $10,000 in contribution from its Board of Directors and employees to two local non-profit organizations to support families who are most severely impacted by the pandemic.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the industry in which we operate. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statement. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements.
The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require us to make complex and subjective judgments. Additional information about these policies can be found in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the ALL when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ALL. Management estimates the ALL balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the ALL may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.
The ALL is maintained at a level that management believes is appropriate to provide for known and inherent incurred loan losses as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet and we have established methodologies for the determination of its adequacy. The methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are determined on an individual loan basis.
The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, changes in economic or other conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net Income
We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $13.1 million, compared to net income of $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in provision for loan losses, offset by a $1.1 million increase in net interest income.
Net Interest Income
The management of interest income and expense is fundamental to our financial performance. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Company’s total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets). We seek to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk through our asset and liability policies. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. Our net interest margin is also adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short-term investments.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, information about: (i) weighted average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin.
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following tables set forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the period shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Change applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume and rate ratably.
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $45.4 million compared to $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.1 million, or 2.5%. This increase was primarily due to a $6.2 million decrease in interest expense from a 95 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in interest income from a 105 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans, and a 139 basis point decrease in the average yield on investments. The significant decreases in the average rates were primarily due to the Federal Reserve’s cumulative market rate cuts of 150 basis points through three rate cuts in January and March.
Total interest income was $53.7 million in 2020, compared to $58.8 million in 2019, a decrease of $5.1 million, or 8.7%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest earned on our loan portfolio and a decrease in interest earned on federal funds sold.
Interest and fees on loans was $51.8 million in 2020, compared to $55.7 million in 2019, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 7.0%. This decrease in interest income on loans was primarily due to a 105 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans, partially offset by a $119.5 million, or 12.8%, increase in the average balance of loans outstanding.
Interest income on total investments was $1.8 million in 2020, compared to $3.1 million in 2019. Interest income on the securities portfolio decreased $176,000, or 13.0%, to $1.2 million in 2020, compared to $1.4 million in 2019. The decrease in interest income on the securities portfolio was primarily due to an 86 basis point decrease in the average yield on the securities portfolio, offset by 33.5% increase in the average balance of securities available for sale held by the Company. Interest income on federal funds sold and other investments decreased $1.1 million, or 61.9%, to $650,000 in 2020 from $1.7 million in 2019, due to a 183 basis point decrease in the average yield on the federal funds sold and other investments, offset by 35.6% increase in the average balance of federal funds sold and other investments held by the Company.
Total interest expense was $8.3 million in 2020, compared to $14.5 million in 2019, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 42.8%. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in interest expense on deposits as result of the downward adjustments of the Company’s rates paid on interest-bearing deposits in response to the rate decreases by the Federal Reserve. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $24.2 million to $704.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $680.3 million at December 31, 2019.
Net interest margins for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 3.72% and 4.19%, respectively.
Provision for Loan Losses
Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. We establish an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for loan losses is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and charging the shortfall or excess, if any, to the current quarter’s expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management’s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area.
The provision for loan losses was $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management evaluated the qualitative and quantitative factors on all loan types to reflect the COVID-19 pandemic’s prolonged potential adverse impacts on national, state, and local economic and business conditions. The changes in qualitative factors accounted for $4.3 million, or 72%, and the changes in quantitative factors, which included a provision of $643,000 for accrued interest receivables on deferred loans, accounted for $1.6 million, or 27% of the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our gross loans were $1.10 billion at 2020, compared to $990.1 million at 2019, an increase of $109.6 million, or 11.1%.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.40% at December 31, 2020 and 1.02% at December 31, 2019.
Noninterest Income
While interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, noninterest income is also an important component. A portion of our noninterest income is associated with SBA lending activity, consisting of gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing retained. Other sources of noninterest income include loan servicing fees, service charges and fees, and gains on the sale of securities.
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.8 million, a decrease of $655,000, or 5.7%, compared to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Income from service charges on deposit accounts was $1.1 million for 2020, compared to $1.7 million, a decrease of $563,000, or 33.2%. This decrease was primarily due to lower overdrafts in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, reflecting higher balances and lower transaction activities on deposit accounts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Total gain on sale of loans was $6.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.9 million for the same period of 2019, an increase of $187,000 or 3.2%.
Gain on sale of SBA loans totaled $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.8 million for the same period of 2019. We sold $85.0 million of SBA loans with an average premium of 8.82% in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the sale of $85.0 million of SBA loans with an average premium of 8.43% in the same period of 2019. We originated $204.5 million of SBA loans, including $66.3 million of SBA PPP loans, in 2020, compared to $110.5 million of SBA loans in 2019. Gain on sale of other loans for both periods were immaterial.
Loan servicing income, net of amortization, increased by $670,000 to $1.9 million in 2020, compared to $1.2 million in 2019. The increase in loan servicing income was due to a $323,000 increase in servicing fees and a $347,000 decrease in servicing asset amortization expense. Our total SBA loan servicing portfolio was $388.8 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $347.8 million as of December 31, 2019.
The servicing assets that result from the sales of SBA loans with servicing retained are amortized over the expected term of the loans using a method approximating the interest method. Servicing income generally declines as the respective loans are repaid.
Other income and fees for 2020 were $1.7 million, compared to $2.6 million for 2019, a decrease of $949,000, or 35.9%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a one-time gain on company owned life insurance of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by a gain of $213,000 from a sale of other property in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company sold a property that has been used for the Company’s internal use with a gain of $213,000 during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $31.9 million, compared to $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $580,000, or 1.8%. The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $20.0 million, compared to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $226,000, or 1.1%. This decrease was attributable to an increase in deferred loan origination cost, partially offset by an increase in the number of employees to support continued growth, annual salary adjustments and increased benefits costs. The increase in deferred loan costs is primarily attributable to the origination of 1,300 new loans, including 979 SBA PPP Loans, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 345 new loans in the year ended December 31, 2019. The average number of full-time equivalent employees was 171.3 in 2020 compared to 166.1 in 2019.
Occupancy and equipment expense for 2020 was $5.0 million, compared to $4.6 million for 2019, an increase of $326,000, or 7.0%. This increase was primarily due the annual increase of rent under our office leases and a new branch opened in the second quarter of 2019.
Data processing and communication expense for 2020 was $1.7 million, compared to $1.5 million for 2019, an increase of $152,000, or 9.9%. This increase was primarily due to supporting increased online transaction activities and supporting increased users on authentication system along with an increase in number of employees in 2020.
Professional fees for 2020 were $1.1 million, compared to $980,000 for 2019, an increase of $121,000, or 12.3%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in internal audit costs in line with the Company’s growth.
FDIC insurance and regulatory assessment expense for 2020 was $449,000, compared to $259,000 for 2019, an increase of $190,000 or 73.4%. The FDIC insurance and regulatory assessments for 2019 was lower due to the small bank assessment credits that was applied to offset the FDIC assessments for the second half of 2019.
Directors’ fees and expenses for 2020 were $700,000, compared to $908,000 for 2019, a decrease of $208,000 or 22.9%. Directors’ fees and expenses include a monthly retainer fee, reimbursement for travel and other expenses, and stock-based expenses relating to equity awards granted to our directors in prior years under our equity plans. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based expenses resulting from the full vesting of the restricted stock units in July 2020. Directors’ stock-based expenses for 2020 and 2019 were $252,000 and $431,000, respectively.
Our aggregate donations to the Foundation and other charitable and community contributions for 2020 were $1.3 million, compared to $1.6 million for 2019, a decrease of $251,000, or 15.8%. The decrease was due to decreased donation accruals for Open Stewardship Foundation, which is directly proportionate to our after-tax net income. On an annual basis, we donate 10% of our consolidated net income after taxes to the Foundation.
Other expenses for 2020 were $1.2 million compared to $1.5 million for 2019, a decrease of $345,000, or 22.5%. The decrease was primarily due to Company’s proactive management of overhead expenses amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $5.1 million in 2020, compared to $5.3 million in 2019. Effective tax rates were 28.0% and 24.1% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the less permanent difference in 2020 compared to 2019. These differences are substantially attributable to one-time proceeds from company owned life insurance received in 2019 and realizing a lower amount of tax benefits resulting from the exercise of non-qualified stock options in 2020 compared to 2019.
Some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying GAAP, leading to timing differences between our actual tax liability and the amount accrued for liability based on book income. These temporary differences comprise the “deferred” portion of our tax expense or benefit, which accumulates on our books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability, until such time as they reverse.
Realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon us generating sufficient future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences, along with the utilization of tax credit carry forwards and the net operating loss carry forwards for Federal and California state income tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income. Under GAAP a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions.
We recognized net deferred tax assets of $5.2 million and $3.2 million at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.
After consideration of the matters in the preceding paragraph, we have determined that it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 will be fully realized in future years.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Net Income
We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $16.8 million compared to net income of $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to a $3.3 million increase in net interest income and a $2.1 million increase in noninterest income, offset by a $3.0 million increase in noninterest expense.
Net Interest Income
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, information about our: (i) weighted average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin.
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following tables set forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the period shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Change applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume and rate ratably.
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $44.3 million compared to $41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.3 million, or 8.1%. This increase was primarily due to a 15.9% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, coupled with a 20 basis point improvement in the average yield on loans, offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the average yield on securities and a 54 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Federal Reserve’s cumulative market rate decreased 75 basis points through three rate cuts in each of August, September, and October 2019. The increase in the average yield on loan was primarily due to a greater volume of new loan origination with higher yield during the first 7 months in 2019 than new loan origination during the last 5 months of 2019. The Company originated new loans of $231.0 million for the first 7 months in 2019 and $162.2 million for the last 5 months of 2019.
Total interest income was $58.8 million in 2019, compared to $50.1 million in 2018, an increase of $8.7 million, or 17.4%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on our loan portfolio. Interest and fees on loans was $55.7 million in 2019, compared to $48.1 million in 2018, an increase of $7.6 million, or 15.8%. This increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to a 12.0% increase in the average balance of loans outstanding and a 20 basis point improvement in the average yield on loans.
Interest income on total investments was $3.1 million in 2019, compared to $2.0 million in 2018. Interest income on the securities portfolio increased $368,000, or 37.4%, to $1.4 million in 2019, compared to $985.000 in 2018. The increase in interest income on the securities portfolio was primarily due to a 24.9% increase in the average balance of securities available for sale held by the Company and a 22 basis point increase in the average yield on the securities portfolio. Interest income on federal funds sold and other investments increased $731,000, or 75.0%, to $1.7 million in 2019 from $975,000 in 2018, due to a 103.3% increase in the average balance of federal funds sold held by the Company, but offset by a 41 basis point decrease in the average yield on the federal funds sold and other investments. A CRA qualified mutual fund was reclassified to other investment following the adoption of ASU 2016-01 effective January 2018.
Total interest expense was $14.5 million in 2019, compared to $9.1 million in 2018, an increase of $5.4 million, or 59.2%. The increase was primarily due to increases in interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on deposits was $14.5 million in 2019, compared to $9.0 million in 2018, an increase of $5.5 million, or 61.8%. This increase was primarily due to a 20.5% increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, coupled with a 54 basis point increase in the average interest rate paid.
Net interest margins for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 4.19% and 4.49%, respectively.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses was $1.10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.27 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to a decrease to a specific reserve for a SBA commercial loan, upon the confirmation of the SBA government guarantee, and a decrease in reserve for a commercial loan that was fully charged off, and such decrease was partially offset by an increase in reserve from an increase in our loan portfolio. Our gross loans were $990.1 million at 2019, compared to $875.1 million at 2018, an increase of $115.1 million, or 13.2%.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.02% at December 31, 2019 and 1.10% at December 31, 2018.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $11.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 22.5%, compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Total gain on sale of loans was $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4.9 million for the same period of 2018, an increase of $1.0 million or 21.0%.
Gain on sale of SBA loans totaled $5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4.8 million for the same period of 2018. We sold $85.0 million of SBA loans with an average premium of 8.43% in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the sale of $85.7 million of SBA loans with an average premium of 7.19% in the same period of 2018. We originated $110.5 million of SBA loans in 2019, compared to $99.4 million in 2018. Gain on sale of other loans for both periods were immaterial.
Loan servicing income, net of amortization, increased by $108,000 to $1.2 million in 2019, compared to $1.1 million in 2018. The increase in loan servicing income was due to a $150,000 increase in servicing fees, partially offset by a $43,000 increase in servicing asset amortization expense. Our total SBA loan servicing portfolio was $347.8 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $328.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in the servicing portfolio reflects the sales of SBA loans in 2019.
Other income and fees for 2019 were $2.6 million, compared to $1.5 million for 2018, an increase of $1.2 million, or 79.1%. The increase was primarily attributable to a one-time gain on company owned life insurance of $1.2 million.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $32.5 million, compared to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.0 million, or 10.0%. The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $20.3 million, compared to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.4%. This increase was attributable to an increase in the number of employees to support continued growth, annual salary adjustments and increased benefits costs. The average number of full-time equivalent employees was 166.1 in 2019 compared to 143.1 in 2018.
Occupancy and equipment expense for 2019 was $4.6 million, compared to $4.1 million for 2018, an increase of $537,000, or 13.1%. This increase was primarily due to the opening of our new branch in Carrollton, Texas, which opened in the second quarter of 2019, and the annual increase of rent under our other offices leases.
Data processing and communication expense for 2019 was $1.5 million, compared to $1.2 million for 2018, an increase of $299,000, or 24.3%. This increase was primarily due to implementing various data processing system projects in order to support continued growth in 2019.
Professional fees for 2019 were $980,000, compared to $921,000 for 2018, an increase of $59,000, or 6.4%. The increase was due to an increase in financial reporting and auditing costs as additional regulatory reporting requirements became applicable in 2019.
FDIC insurance and regulatory assessment expense for 2019 was $259,000, compared to $405,000 for 2018, a decrease of $146,000 or 36.0%. The decrease was due to the small bank assessment credits that was applied to offset the FDIC assessments starting June 30, 2019.
Directors’ fees and expenses for 2019 were $908,000, compared to $851,000 for 2018, an increase of $57,000 or 6.7%. Directors’ fees and expenses include a monthly retainer fee, reimbursement for travel and other expenses, and stock-based expenses relating to equity awards granted in prior years under our equity plans to our directors. Directors’ fees and expenses (not including stock-based expenses) for 2019 was $477,000 compared to $420,000 in 2018, an increase of $57,000, or 13.5%. The increase was due to an annual base increase in directors’ monthly retainer fees in 2019. Directors’ stock-based expenses for 2019 and 2018 remained unchanged and were $431,000 in each period.
Our aggregate donations to the Foundation and other charitable and community contributions for 2019 were $1.6 million, compared to $1.4 million for 2018, an increase of $145,000, or 10.1%. The increase was due to increased donation accruals for Open Stewardship Foundation, which is directly proportionate to the growth in our after-tax net income.
Other expenses for 2019 were $1.5 million compared to $1.6 million for 2018, a decrease of $57,000, or 3.6%. The decrease was primarily due to decreased loan related expenses.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $5.3 million in 2019, compared to $5.2 million in 2018. Effective tax rates were 24.1% and 26.8% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the greater permanent difference in 2019 compared to 2018. These differences are substantially attributable to one-time proceeds from company owned life insurance received in 2019.
We recognized net deferred tax assets of $3.2 million and $3.7 million at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. We determined that it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 would be fully realized in future years.
Financial Condition of the Company for Year Ended December 31, 2020
Total assets increased $187.3 million, or 15.9%, to $1.37 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase primarily resulted from an increase of $109.6 million, or 11.1%, in gross loans and an increase of $35.2 million, or 62.3%, in investment portfolio. We funded our asset growth primarily with an increase of $179.4 million in deposits in 2020.
Investment portfolio
The securities portfolio is the second largest component of our interest earning assets, and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of our financial condition. The portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender; (ii) it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; (iii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool, because it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and our other funding sources; and (iv) it is an alternative interest-earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans.
We classify our securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. Accounting guidance requires available-for-sale securities to be marked to fair value with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders’ equity. Monthly adjustments are made to reflect changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
All of the securities in our investment portfolio were classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2020. There were no held-to-maturity or trading securities in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2020. All available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. Securities available-for-sale consist primarily of US government-sponsored agency securities, home mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.
Securities available-for-sale increased $35.2 million, or 62.3%, to $91.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $56.5 million at December 31, 2019. Securities available-for-sale increased $1.2 million, or 2.2%, to $56.53 million at December 31, 2019 from $55.3 million at December 31, 2018. No issuer of the available-for-sale securities, other than FNMA and FHLMC, comprised more than ten percent of our shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio as of the dates presented.
Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At December 31, 2020, we evaluated the securities which had an unrealized loss for other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) and determined all decline in value to be temporary. We anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our investment securities as of the dates presented. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
We have not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge fixed rate loans or securities to otherwise mitigate interest rate risk.
Loans
Our loans represent the largest portion of our earning assets, substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing our financial condition.
At December 31, 2020, gross loans including deferred costs totaled $1.10 billion, compared to $990.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $875.1 million at December 31, 2018.
The loan distribution table that follows sets forth our gross loans outstanding, and the percentage distribution in each category as of the dates indicated:
Gross loans increased $109.6 million, or 11.1%, to $1.10 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $990.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Gross loans increased $115.1 million, or 13.2%, to $990.1 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $875.1 million as of December 31, 2018. The increases in our gross loans in 2020 resulted from originations of $66.3 million of SBA PPP loans and additional organic growth in commercial real estate loans and SBA loans.
The following tables presents the maturity distribution of our loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined (fixed) interest rates and those with variable (floating) interest rates.
Our loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial real estate, commercial (primarily manufacturing, wholesale, and services oriented entities), SBA loans (unguaranteed portion) with the remaining balance in home mortgage, and consumer loans. We do not have any material concentrations by industry or group of industries in the loan portfolio. However, 83.3% of our gross loans were secured by real property at December 31, 2020, compared to 88.2% at December 31, 2019.
We have established concentration limits in the loan portfolio for commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and unsecured lending, among others. All loan types are within established limits. We use underwriting guidelines to assess the borrowers’ historical cash flow to determine debt service, and we further stress test the debt service under higher interest rate scenarios. Financial and performance covenants are used in commercial lending agreements to allow us to react to a borrower’s deteriorating financial condition, should that occur.
Commercial real estate loans include owner-occupied and non-occupied commercial real estate. We originate both fixed and adjustable rate loans. Adjustable rate loans are based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate. At December 31, 2020, approximately 65% of the commercial real estate portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans. Our policy maximum loan-to-value, or LTV, is 70% for commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2020, our average loan to value for commercial real estate loans was 53%. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $651.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $630.7 million at December 31, 2019, and $503.8 million at December 31, 2018.
We are designated an SBA Preferred Lender under the SBA Preferred Lender Program. We offer mostly SBA 7(a) variable-rate loans. We generally sell the 75% guaranteed portion of the SBA loans that we originate. Our SBA loans are typically made to small-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail, hotel/motel and service businesses for working capital needs or business expansions. SBA loans have maturities up to 25 years. Typically, non-real estate secured loans mature in less than 10 years. Collateral may also include inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, and may include personal guarantees. Our unguaranteed SBA loans collateralized by real estate are monitored by collateral type and included in our CRE Concentration Guidance.
As of December 31, 2020, our SBA portfolio totaled $211.4 million including $64.9 million of SBA PPP loans, compared to $132.3 million as of December 31, 2019. These increases were primarily due to origination of SBA PPP loans and continued growth of our SBA loan portfolio. We originated $204.5 million, including $66.3 million of SBA PPP loans, and $110.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We sold $113.9 million and $85.0 million of SBA loans during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. SBA portfolio totaled $127.4 million at December 31, 2018.
From our total SBA loan portfolio, $136.2 million is secured by real estate and $75.2 million is unsecured or secured by business assets at December 31, 2020.
Commercial and industrial loans totaled $107.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $103.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $114.0 million at December 31, 2018.
We originate mainly non-qualified, alternative documentation single-family home mortgage loans (“home mortgage”) primarily through broker relationships, but also through our branch network. The loan product is a five-year or seven-year hybrid adjustable rate mortgage, which reprices after five years to the one-year LIBOR plus certain spreads. We originate the non-qualified single-family home mortgage loans held by us for investment.
Home mortgage loans totaled $128.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $120.7 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $7.5 million, or 6.2%. The increase was primarily due to greater loan originations in 2020, compared to 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we originated $48.2 million and sold $9.2 million in home mortgage loans. Payoffs and paydowns for the same period were $26.7 million and $5.5 million, respectively. During the same period in 2019, we originated $28.8 million and sold $5.7 million in home mortgage loans. Payoffs and paydowns for the same period were $24.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Home mortgage loans totaled $127.3 million at December 31, 2018.
Loan Payment Deferrals: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a loan modification program was designed and implemented to assist our clients experiencing financial stress resulting from the economic impacts caused by the global pandemic. The Company has offered loan payment deferrals of up to twelve months for commercial and consumer borrowers impacted by the pandemic who have not been delinquent over 30 days on payments at the time of borrowers’ deferral requests. As of December 31, 2020, the Company processed loan deferments for borrowers across multiple industries representing 183 loan accounts, with an aggregate loan balance of $236.2million under the interagency guidance and Section 4013 of the CARES Act. Recent interagency guidance from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation confirmed with the FASB that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief, are not to be considered TDRs. We believe our loan modification program satisfies the applicable requirements.
As of December 31, 2020, 165 loans with an aggregate balance of $205.0 million, including 67 home mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of $29.2 million, have resumed regular payments.
The following tables summarize loan portfolio breakdown by industry and loan deferral requests as of the dates presented:
Loan Servicing
As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we serviced $388.8 million, $347.8 million, and $328.5 million respectively, of SBA loans for others. Activity for loan servicing rights was as follows:
Loan servicing rights are reported on our consolidated balance sheets and reported net of amortization.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when management believes a loan balance is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Management’s methodology for estimating the allowance balance consists of several key elements, which include specific allowances on individual impaired loans and the formula driven allowances on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off.
The allowance for loan losses is determined on a quarterly basis and reflects management’s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We also rely on internal and external loan review procedures to further assess individual loans and loan pools, and economic data for overall industry and geographic trends. The computation includes element of judgment and high levels of subjectivity.
A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include loans on non-accrual status and performing restructured loans. Income from loans on non-accrual status is recognized to the extent cash is received and when the loan’s principal balance is deemed collectible. Depending on a particular loan’s circumstances, we measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is considered collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is based solely on the liquidation of the collateral. Fair value, where possible, is determined by independent appraisals, typically on an annual basis. Between appraisal periods, the fair value may be adjusted based on specific events, such as if deterioration of quality of the collateral comes to our attention as part of our problem loan monitoring process, or if discussions with the borrower lead us to believe the last appraised value no longer reflects the actual market value for the collateral. The impairment amount on a collateral-dependent loan is charged-off to the allowance if deemed not collectible and the impairment amount on a loan that is not collateral-dependent is set up as a specific reserve.
In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring. These concessions may include a reduction of the interest rate, principal or accrued interest, extension of the maturity date or other actions intended to minimize potential losses. Loans restructured at a rate equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the time the loan is modified may be excluded from restructured loan disclosures in years subsequent to the restructuring if the loans are in compliance with their modified terms. A restructured loan is considered impaired despite its accrual status and a specific reserve is calculated based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest income on impaired loans is accrued as earned, unless the loan is placed on non-accrual status.
The allowance for loan losses was $15.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $10.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $9.6 million at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to adjustments to qualitative factors on all loan types to reflect the pandemics’ potential impacts and the overall growth in the size of our gross loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.0 million. The qualitative factors accounted for $4.3 million and the quantitative factors accounted for $1.6 million. Our gross loan portfolio grew $109.6 million, or 11.1%, to $1.10 billion at December 31, 2020 from $990.1 million at December 31, 2019, and $115.1 million, or 13.2% to $990.1 million at December 31, 2019 from $875.1 million at December 31, 2018.
In determining the allowance and the related provision for loan losses, we consider three principal elements: (i) valuation allowances based upon probable losses identified during the review of impaired commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, construction and land development loans; (ii) allocations, by loan classes, on loan portfolios based on historical loan loss experience and qualitative factors; and (iii) review of the credit discounts in relationship to the valuation allowance calculated for purchased loans. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to record changes to the total allowance to a level deemed appropriate by us.
It is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The Federal Reserve Board and the DFPI also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process. Based on information currently available, management believes that our allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if California economic conditions and the real estate market in our market area were to weaken. The effect of such events, although uncertain at this time, could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses, which could adversely affect our future growth and profitability. No assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty.
Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses
The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses, provision for loan losses and net charge-offs, by category, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Non-performing Loans
Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more. Delinquent loans may remain on accrual status between 30 days and 90 days past due. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable doubt as to collectability in the normal course of business. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed against current period interest income. Income on non-accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received, and the loan’s principal balance is deemed collectible. Loans are restored to accrual status when loans become well-secured and management believes full collectability of principal and interest is probable.
Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO until sold, and is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. We had no OREO at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Non-performing loans include loans that are 90 days past due and still accruing, loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis and accruing restructured loans. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans plus OREO.
Non-performing loans were $985,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $1.9 million at December 31, 2018. The non-performing loans at December 31, 2019 were paid off in 2020. In 2019, we transferred one non-accrual SBA loan and one non-accrual commercial loan, which were non-performing loans in 2018, to OREO and sold the OREO. We did not recognize any interest income on non-accrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 while the loans were in non-accrual status. Additional interest income that we would have recognized on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms was $40,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, $40,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $27,000 for the same period of 2018.
We recognized interest income on loans modified under troubled debt restructurings of $4,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, $20,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $19,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively. The loan modified under troubled debt restructurings was placed to non-accrual status at December 31, 2020.
The following table sets forth the allocation of our non-performing assets among our different asset categories as of the dates indicated. Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings.
Deposits
We gather deposits primarily through our branch locations. We offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposits accounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts and certificate of deposits. We put continued effort into gathering noninterest demand deposits accounts through marketing to our existing and new loan customers, customer referrals, our marketing staff and various involvement with community networks.
The following table show the composition of deposits by type as of the dates indicated:
The following table summarizes our average deposit balances and weighted average rates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The following tables set forth the maturity of time deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Borrowed Funds
Other than deposits, we also utilized FHLB advances as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. The advances from the FHLB are collateralized by residential and commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $394.0 million, $412.4 million and $357.1 million, respectively. We had $5.0 million in borrowings from the FHLB, which has a 0% interest rate under the Zero-Rate Recovery Advance Program, FHLB’s pandemic relief initiatives. We had no borrowings from FHLB at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Liquidity
Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.
Our liquidity position is supported by the management of liquid assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in correspondent banks, federal funds sold, and fair value of unpledged investment securities. Other available sources of liquidity include wholesale deposits, and additional borrowings from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, and the Federal Reserve discount window.
Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, and increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis.
We had $100.0 million of unsecured federal funds lines with no amounts advanced at December 31, 2020, compared to $13.5 million at December 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In addition, on such dates we had lines of credit from the Federal Reserve discount window of $125.7 million, $124.0 million and $107.7 million, respectively. The Federal Reserve discount window lines were collateralized by a pool of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans totaling $219.1 million, $206.7 million and $179.4 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We did not have any borrowings outstanding with the Federal Reserve at December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018, and our borrowing capacity is limited only by eligible collateral.
Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had $263.0 million of additional borrowing availability with the FHLB at December 31, 2020. We also maintain relationships in the capital markets with brokers to issue certificates of deposit and money market accounts.
Capital Requirements
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for “prompt corrective action”, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. The capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. Qualitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy required us to maintain minimum amounts and various ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, referred to as the “leverage ratio.” For further information, see “Supervision and Regulation.”
The table below also summarizes the capital requirements applicable to us and the Bank in order to be considered “well-capitalized” from a regulatory perspective, as well as our and the Bank’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and were considered to be “well-capitalized” as of the dates reflected in the table below. At December 31, 2020, the FDIC categorized us as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2020 that management believes would change this classification.
Contractual Obligations
The following tables contain supplemental information regarding our total contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if we deem collateral is necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. They are intended to be disbursed, subject to certain condition, upon request of the borrower.
The following table summarized commitments as of the dates presented.
