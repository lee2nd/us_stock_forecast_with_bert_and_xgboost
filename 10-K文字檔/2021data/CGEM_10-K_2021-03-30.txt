Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company developing a diversified pipeline of targeted oncology and immuno-oncology therapies with transformative potential for cancer patients. In approximately four years, by leveraging our differentiated hub-and-spoke business model, we have efficiently developed or in-licensed a pipeline of seven distinct programs. Our unique business model leverages a central operating company and separate subsidiaries that are established to hold and advance individual therapeutic candidates. Cullinan Oncology, Inc., or Cullinan, employs or has consulting agreements with all of our team members and incubates discovery programs until we establish a “spoke” in which to further advance them. In addition, we centralize shared services, including all research and development operations, administrative services and business development, in Cullinan, and allocate employees and resources to each spoke based on the needs and development stage of each therapeutic candidate. As of December 31, 2020, we had five partially-owned development subsidiaries (together as the Subsidiaries), or spokes: Cullinan Pearl Corp., or Cullinan Pearl, which is advancing CLN-081; Cullinan Apollo Corp., or Cullinan Apollo, which was formed around VK-2019, a drug that we decided to discontinue development of in May 2020; Cullinan MICA Corp., or Cullinan MICA, which is advancing CLN-619; Cullinan Florentine Corp., or Cullinan Florentine, which is advancing CLN-049; and Cullinan Amber Corp., or Cullinan Amber, which is developing our AMBER platform and advancing CLN-617 as its first therapeutic candidate. Cullinan Pearl, Cullinan Apollo, Cullinan MICA, Cullinan Florentine and Cullinan Amber are collectively referred to as the Asset Subsidiaries. Our earlier-stage programs, NexGem, Opal and Jade, are currently held in Cullinan. As of December 31, 2019, we had five wholly and partially-owned development subsidiaries: Cullinan Management, Inc., Cullinan Amber, Cullinan Apollo, Cullinan Florentine and Cullinan Pearl.
Since our inception in 2016, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on raising capital, organizing and staffing our company, identifying, acquiring or in-licensing and developing product and technology rights, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio and developing and advancing our programs. To support these activities, we (i) identify and secure new programs, (ii) set up new subsidiaries to further advance individual programs, (iii) recruit key management team members, (iv) raise and allocate capital across the portfolio and (v) provide certain shared services, including research and development operations, administrative services, and business development, to our subsidiaries. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of Redeemable Preferred Units and Common Stock. In October 2016, we received net proceeds $4.0 million from the purchase and sale of our Series Seed preferred units. Subsequently, in April 2017, we received net proceeds $50.0 million from the purchase and sale of our Series A preferred units. In October and December 2019, we received net proceeds $83.9 million for the purchase and sale of our Series B preferred units. In February and March 2020, we received net proceeds $14.0 million for the additional purchase and sale of our Series B preferred units. In December 2020, we received net proceeds $124.8 million for the purchase and sale of our Series C preferred units. In January 2021, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) and received net proceeds of $264.7 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $210.2 million, which does not include net proceeds from our IPO, completed in January 2021, nor does it include upfront proceeds from the Zai Lab License Agreement, which were received in the first quarter of 2021. We have incurred operating losses and have had negative cash flows from operations since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company’s net loss was $21.7 million and $59.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $93.3 million. We expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our future viability is dependent on the success of our research and development and our ability to access additional capital to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that our current operating plan will be achieved or that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, compliance with government regulations and the ability to obtain additional capital to fund operations. Our therapeutic programs will require significant additional research and development efforts, including preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require additional capital, adequate personnel and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. There can be no assurance that our research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for our intellectual property will be obtained, that any products developed will obtain necessary government regulatory approval or that any approved products will be commercially viable.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread globally. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. Many countries around the world have imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus and have closed non-essential businesses, and many local jurisdictions continue to have such restrictions in place.
As local jurisdictions continue to put restrictions in place, the Company’s ability to continue to operate its business may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and drug product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented remote working and thus far, has not experienced a significant disruption or delay in its operations as it relates to the clinical development or drug production of the Company’s product candidates.
The spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect the Company economically. While the ultimate economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others, the pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions in the general commercial activity and the global economy and caused financial market volatility and uncertainty in significant and unforeseen ways in the recent months. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect the Company’s liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect the Company’s business.
To date, COVID-19 has not had a financial impact on the Company. However, COVID-19 has impacted the pace of our enrollment in our clinical trials and our preclinical studies. The full extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations and financial performance is currently unknown and depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
Since our inception, we have created wholly-owned subsidiaries or made investments in certain controlled entities. Losses attributed to noncontrolling interests are reported separately in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The entities that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements include the following:
(1)
Ownership percentages are reflected on a fully-diluted basis.
(2)
In November 2020, the board of directors of Cullinan Pearl, Cullinan Amber, and Cullinan Florentine terminated their respective stock option and grant plan and the remaining shares reserved for issuance under each respective stock option and grant plan were retired to the status of authorized and unissued shares.
(3)
Reflects the closing of the second tranche of the Series A Preferred Stock financing of Cullinan Florentine and the issuance of common stock of Cullinan Florentine to DKFZ and UFE in December 2020.
(4)
In December 2020, the board of directors and stockholders of Cullinan MICA approved an amendment to its equity plan that decreased the authorized amount of shares under its equity plan such that no further grants could be made under its equity plan. Any authorized but unissued shares under the equity plan were returned to the status of authorized, unissued shares of common stock. The Company’s ownership will increase to approximately 54%, on a fully-diluted basis, upon completion of the remaining two tranches of Series A financing, subject to the determination of Cullinan MICA’s board. See “-Cullinan MICA” below for additional information.
(5)
In January 2021, the Company completed its initial public offering and Cullinan Oncology, LLC (the LLC) merged into Cullinan Management, Inc. as part of the Reorganization. In February 2021, Cullinan Management, Inc. changed its name to Cullinan Oncology, Inc.
Cullinan Apollo
Cullinan Apollo, incorporated in November 2018, is our partially-owned operating subsidiary that was formed around VK-2019. In December 2018, Cullinan Apollo licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to VK-2019, an Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) inhibitor, from The Wistar Institute, or Wistar. Cullinan Apollo also entered into a Collaborative Research Agreement with Wistar to continue preclinical research and development of VK-2019. In May 2020, Cullinan Apollo discontinued development of VK-2019 and terminated its license and collaboration agreements with Wistar.
Cullinan Pearl
Cullinan Pearl, incorporated in November 2018, is our partially-owned operating subsidiary that has exclusive worldwide rights, excluding Japan and Greater China, to CLN-081, our orally available small molecule designed as a next generation, irreversible EGFR inhibitor that is in development for the treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. In February 2019, Cullinan Pearl entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Taiho Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd., or Taiho Pharma, for the worldwide rights to CLN-081 outside of Japan, which Taiho Pharma retained. As of February 28, 2021, we and Taiho Ventures, LLC, or Taiho Ventures, have purchased an aggregate of $23.0 million in Series A preferred stock of Cullinan Pearl. Specifically, in February 2019, Cullinan Pearl issued to Taiho Ventures 1,860,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $1.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1,860,000. In August 2020, at the election of the board of directors of Cullinan Pearl, Cullinan Pearl completed its subsequent closing of its Series A Preferred Stock financing and issued to Taiho Ventures an additional 1,206,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,206,000. As of February 28, 2021, we own 87% and Taiho Ventures owns 13% of the Series A preferred stock. Assuming conversion of the Series A preferred stock, we own 80%, Taiho Ventures owns 10%, and Taiho Pharma owns 10% of the fully diluted common stock outstanding of Cullinan Pearl. Pursuant to a voting agreement, by and among Cullinan Pearl, we, Taiho Ventures, and other stockholders of Cullinan Pearl, the Series A Preferred stockholders, acting by majority vote, have the right to appoint two members of the board of directors, Taiho Ventures has the right to appoint one director; our chief executive officer, Mr. Hughes, serves as the fourth board member; and two independent directors are appointed by a majority of the other four Cullinan Pearl board of directors.
Cullinan Amber
Cullinan Amber, incorporated in December 2019, is our partially-owned operating subsidiary that has exclusive worldwide rights to the patents related to the technology that originated in the laboratory of Professor Dane Wittrup at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT. In December 2019, Cullinan Amber entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement with MIT. We currently own 90% of the issued equity of Cullinan Amber, on a fully-diluted basis, including 100% of the shares of Series A preferred stock. MIT and Dr. Wittrup each own approximately 5%, or an aggregate 10%, of the issued and outstanding equity of Cullinan Amber on a fully-diluted basis. Pursuant to the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, by and among Cullinan Amber and us, upon election by the Cullinan Amber board of directors, we will purchase up to an additional 9,000,000 Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock in one or more closings. Pursuant to a voting agreement by and among Cullinan Amber, us, and other stockholders, of the three person board of directors, the holders of Series A preferred stock, acting by majority vote, have the right to designate two members of the board of directors.

Cullinan MICA
Cullinan MICA Corp. (formerly known as PDI Therapeutics, Inc.), or Cullinan MICA, of which we assumed operational control in May 2020, is our partially-owned operating subsidiary that owns intellectual property related to CLN-619, our MICA/B-targeted humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody. We purchased 24% of the issued equity of Cullinan MICA, on a fully-diluted basis, including 89% of the outstanding shares of Series A Senior Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the Series A Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement by and among us, Cullinan MICA, and other stockholders of Cullinan MICA, we will purchase up to an additional $16.0 million of the aggregate $18.0 million Series A Senior Preferred Stock in two milestone-dependent closings. The first closing milestone relates to the establishment of an acceptable preliminary dosing, pharmacokinetic, and safety profile, as well as certain Good Manufacturing Practice and regulatory events, in a monotherapy dose escalation study for CLN-619 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Upon the (i) determination of Cullinan MICA’s board of directors that the milestone has been achieved or (ii) the election of Cullinan MICA’s board of directors to waive the milestone requirements, the purchasers are required to invest approximately an additional $8.0 million. The second closing milestone relates to the global expansion cohorts for CLN-619 and will be met upon: confirmation of dosing and pharmacodynamics effects, demonstration of clinical efficacy, and achievement of an acceptable safety profile. Upon the (i) determination of Cullinan MICA’s board of directors that the milestone has been achieved or (ii) the election of Cullinan MICA’s board of directors to waive the milestone requirements, the purchasers are required to invest approximately an additional $10.0 million. In December 2020, the stockholders and the board of directors of Cullinan MICA approved an amendment to its equity plan that decreased the authorized amount of shares under its equity plan such that no further grants could be made under its equity plan. Any authorized but unissued shares under the equity plan were returned to the status of authorized, unissued shares of common stock. Pursuant to a Subscription Agreement, we subsequently purchased an aggregate of 3,367,804 shares of common stock of Cullinan MICA. As a result of these transactions, our ownership percentage in Cullinan MICA increased to approximately 35% as of December 31, 2020. Subject to the completion of Cullinan MICA’s Series A financing, we will own approximately 54% of the fully diluted capital stock outstanding. Pursuant to a voting agreement, by and among Cullinan MICA, us, and other stockholders of Cullinan MICA, of the five person board of directors, we have the right to appoint three members of the board of directors. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on the accounting implications of this transaction.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts for our therapeutic candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.
Operating expenses
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the research and development of our therapeutic candidates and programs. We expense research and development costs and intangible assets acquired that have no alternative future use as incurred. These expenses include:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and equity-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with organizations that support our drug discovery and development activities;
•
expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our therapeutic candidates and programs, including under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs;
•
costs related to contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that are primarily engaged to provide drug substance and product for our clinical trials, research and development programs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, nonclinical studies and other scientific development services;
•
the costs of acquiring and manufacturing nonclinical and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing registration and validation batches;
•
costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; and
•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements.
Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.
Therapeutic candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of any current or future therapeutic candidates.
Our clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up periods;
•
the cost and timing of manufacturing our therapeutic candidates;
•
the phase of development of our therapeutic candidates;
•
the efficacy and safety profile of our therapeutic candidates; and
•
the number of therapeutic candidates we are developing.
The successful development and commercialization of therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:
•
the timing and progress of nonclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of nonclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
raising necessary additional funds;
•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements;
•
our ability to maintain our current development programs and to establish new ones;
•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•
the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
the availability of drug substance and drug product for use in the production of our therapeutic candidates;
•
establishing and maintaining agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our therapeutic candidates are approved;
•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•
the commercialization of our therapeutic candidates, if and when approved;
•
obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement;
•
the acceptance of our therapeutic candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
•
competition with other products; and
•
a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our therapeutic candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that therapeutic candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates or programs.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive management, finance, corporate and business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax, and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses; marketing expenses; and other operating costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support development of our therapeutic candidates and programs and our continued research activities. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.
Other Income
Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.
Income Taxes
The LLC entity elected to be treated under the Partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the LLC entity was not viewed as a tax-paying entity in any jurisdiction and all income and deductions of the LLC entity were reported on our members’ individual income tax returns and no income taxes were recorded by the LLC entity. The LLC entity did not have any operations.
Our Subsidiaries are taxed as corporations for federal and state income tax purposes. Our Subsidiaries account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Current income taxes are based on taxable income for federal and state reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Due to our Subsidiaries’ lacking earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
Our Subsidiaries recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon settlement. Changes in measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $43.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We separately disclosed additional details for the research and development expenses incurred in connection with the research and development activities conducted for the therapeutic candidates and programs being developed by our partially-owned subsidiaries Cullinan Amber, Cullinan Florentine, Cullinan MICA and Cullinan Pearl, certain of our consolidated entities, as we believe they represent key portfolio value drivers. We also disclosed research and development expense detail for Cullinan Apollo, which we are planning to dissolve in the near future. The increase of $18.8 million of research and development expenses of the Asset Subsidiaries was primarily due to the acquisition of CLN-619 in May 2020, increase in pre-clinical and CMC costs to support IND-enabling activity for CLN-049, and increased trial enrollment for CLN-081. The remaining increase was primarily related to equity-based compensation expense for common unit options granted under the 2020 Unit Option and Grant Plan in the fourth quarter of 2020, increase in the discovery and development of early stage therapeutic candidates and increased headcount.
We are heavily dependent on the success of our therapeutic candidates, the most advanced of which are in preclinical or the early stages of clinical development, which is a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes and the potential for substantial delays. We cannot give any assurance that any of our therapeutic candidates will receive regulatory approval or, if approved, achieve commercial success.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $11.6 million was primarily due to increased headcount and common unit options granted under the 2020 Unit Option and Grant Plan in the fourth quarter of 2020. Other costs under general and administration expense increase by $1.2 million on outside professional services and diligence regarding the Cullinan Amber and Cullinan Florentine transactions, as well as inflationary impact of personnel- and occupancy-related expenses. These increases were largely due to our operations expanding and an increase in headcount to support the additional operations.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net was $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $0.3 million was primarily related to an increase in interest income resulting from higher average balances on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest
Net losses are attributed to noncontrolling interests under the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method for certain subsidiaries. The HLBV method is a point in time calculation that utilizes inputs to determine the amount that the noncontrolling interest holders would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation at each balance sheet date based on the liquidation provisions of the respective articles of incorporation. The increase of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest from $1.0 million in 2019 compared to $7.7 million in 2020 was primarily related to the acquisition of our subsidiary Cullinan MICA in 2020 and the issuance of anti-dilution shares in our Asset Subsidiaries, which contributed $5.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of products for several years, if at all. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our Redeemable Preferred Units. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $210.2 million. In January 2021, the Company completed its IPO and received net proceeds of $264.7 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect that our current cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, will be sufficient to fund operations through 2024. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all.
Cash flows
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2020
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $20.9 million of cash and primarily consisted of our net loss of $21.7 million, offset by changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million and non-cash charges of $0.6 million. Our non-cash charges of $0.6 million primarily consisted of a $0.5 million license expense in exchange for subsidiary capital stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $29.8 million of cash and primarily consisted of our net loss of $59.5 million, offset by changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $6.9 million, and non-cash charges of $22.8 million. Our non-cash charges of $22.8 million primarily consisted of $14.9 million from equity-based compensation expense, $6.4 million relating to the IPR&D charge in connection with the acquisition of MICA and a $1.2 million license expense in exchange for subsidiary capital stock.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2019, investing activities used $35.4 million of cash for the purchases short-term investments and less than $0.1 million for the purchases of property and equipment.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, investing activities used $5.4 million of cash and primarily consisted of $6.8 million used for the purchases of short-term investments and less than $0.1 million for the purchases of property and equipment, offset by $1.5 million acquired in the MICA asset acquisition.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $85.7 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of Series B preferred units of $83.9 million and net proceeds of $1.8 million related to the issuance of noncontrolling interests.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $140.1 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of Series B and Series C preferred units of $14.0 million and $124.8 million, respectively, and net proceeds related to the issuance of noncontrolling interests of $1.2 million.
Future Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities, manufacturing and clinical trials of our therapeutic candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Our expenses will also increase as we:
•
continue our research and development efforts and submit investigational new drug applications, or INDs, for our therapeutic candidates and programs;
•
conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future therapeutic candidates, including but not limited to CLN-081, CLN-049, and CLN-619;
•
take temporary precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees;
•
experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues, or other regulatory challenges;
•
develop the necessary processes, controls, and manufacturing capabilities to obtain marketing approval for our therapeutic candidates and to support manufacturing on a commercial scale;
•
develop and implement plans to establish and operate in-house manufacturing operations and facility;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any therapeutic candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•
hire and retain additional personnel, such as non-clinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, distribution, legal, compliance, medical affairs, finance, general and administrative, commercial, and scientific personnel;
•
develop, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and

transition our organization to being a public company.
As a publicly-traded company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which requires the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates to exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
To achieve compliance with Section 404 after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. We expect these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be sufficient to fund operations through 2024. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. As we progress with our development programs and the regulatory review process, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, pre-commercial activities and commercialization. We may also require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other programs to further expand our pipeline.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of our therapeutic candidates and programs, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, laboratory testing and preclinical and clinical development for our current and future therapeutic candidates;
•
timely completion of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors;
•
the prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects or other safety issues experienced by patients receiving our therapeutic candidates or future therapeutic candidates;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and license agreements on favorable terms, if at all, and the extent to which we acquire or in-license technologies or programs, if at all;
•
our ability to enroll clinical trials in a timely manner and to quickly resolve any delays or clinical holds that may be imposed on our development programs;
•
timing delays with respect to preclinical and clinical development of our current and future therapeutic candidates, including as result of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the costs of expanding our facilities to accommodate our expected growth in personnel;
•
our ability and the ability of third parties with whom we contract to manufacture adequate clinical and commercial supplies of our therapeutic candidates or any future therapeutic candidates, remain in good standing with regulatory authorities and develop, validate, and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;
•
the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license technologies or programs;
•
the sales price and availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for our therapeutic candidates, if and when approved; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
Until such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, current ownership interests will be diluted. If we raise additional funds through government or third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or therapeutic candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or therapeutic candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:
We have certain payment obligations under various license and collaboration agreements. Under these agreements, we are required to make milestone payments upon successful completion and achievement of certain intellectual property, clinical, regulatory, and sales milestones. The payment obligations under the license and collaboration agreements are contingent upon future events, such as our achievement of specified development, clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones, and we will be required to make milestone and royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under these agreements. As the achievement and timing of these future milestone payments are not probable or estimable, such amounts have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, or in the contractual obligations table above.
In December 2020, we made a payment of $1.0 million related to certain options available to us under our collaboration agreement with Adimab, related to CLN-978. We expect to make an additional payment of $0.5 million in 2021 under the same agreement.
In addition, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and with vendors for preclinical studies, manufacturing services, and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice. These payments are not included in the contractual obligations table above.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation
We consolidate entities in which we have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest. We evaluate each of our subsidiaries to determine whether the entity represents a variable interest entity (VIE) for which consolidation should be evaluated under the VIE model, or alternatively, if the entity is a voting interest entity, for which consolidation should be evaluated using the voting interest model. We have concluded that none of our subsidiaries is a VIE and we have consolidated each subsidiary under the voting interest model. Under the voting interest model, we consolidate the entity if it is determined 1) that we directly, or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting shares or other equity holders do not have substantive voting, participation, or liquidation rights, or 2) when we have a controlling financial interest through our control of the board of directors, and the significant decisions of the entity are made at the board level.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations is a result of our investments in our consolidated entities, which include Cullinan Amber, Cullinan Florentine, Cullinan Pearl and Cullinan MICA, and consists of the portion of the net loss of those consolidated entities that is not allocated to us. Changes in the amount of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests related to these subsidiaries are directly impacted by changes in the net loss of the consolidated entity. To the extent that ownership interests in the Asset Subsidiaries are held by entities other than the LLC entity, management reports these as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated balance sheets. Earnings or losses are attributed to noncontrolling interests under the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method. The HLBV method is a point in time calculation that utilizes inputs to determine the amount that we and our noncontrolling interest holders would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation at each balance sheet date based on the liquidation provisions of the respective articles of incorporation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
Research and Development Contract Costs and Accruals
We record accrued liabilities for estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of preclinical studies, clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced and include these costs in accrued research and development liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses.
We accrue for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and in accordance with agreements established with our third-party service providers for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued research and development liabilities balance at each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, the status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. We record advance payments to service providers as prepaid assets, which are expensed as the contracted services are performed. To date, there have been no material differences between our accrued costs and actual costs.
Equity-Based Compensation Expense
Equity-based compensation is measured at the grant date for all equity-based awards made to employees and non-employees based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The Company has elected to recognize the actual forfeitures by reducing the equity-based compensation expense in the same period as the forfeitures occur.
As there was no public market for our Non-Voting Incentive Units when we were a private company, our board of directors determined the fair value of our Non-Voting Incentive Units by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including having contemporaneous and retrospective valuations of our equity performed by a third-party valuation specialist, valuations of comparable peer public companies, sales of our Redeemable Preferred Units, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of our Non-Voting Incentive Units, and general and industry-specific economic outlook.
The LLC estimated the fair value of the common unit options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of objective and subjective assumptions. Certain assumptions used, including the fair value of the Company’s common stock and stock price volatility, represent management’s estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards.
We classify equity-based compensation in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
Income Taxes
The LLC entity elected to be treated under the Partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, we were not viewed as a tax-paying entity in any jurisdiction and all income and deductions were reported on the members’ individual income tax returns and no income taxes were recorded by the LLC entity. The LLC entity does not have any operations.
Our Subsidiaries are taxed as corporations for federal and state income tax purposes. Our Subsidiaries account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Current income taxes are based on taxable income for federal and state reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Due to our Subsidiaries’ lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
Our Subsidiaries recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon settlement. Changes in measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Status
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company,” or an EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for new or revised accounting standards during the period in which we remain an emerging growth company; however, we may adopt certain new or revised accounting standards early.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700.0 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year or that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time, we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to of our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report.
