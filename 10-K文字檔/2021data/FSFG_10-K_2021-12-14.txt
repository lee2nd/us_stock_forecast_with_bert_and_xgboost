Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Overview
Income. Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Other significant sources of pre-tax income are service charges (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees), ATM and interchange fees on debit and credit cards, increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance, income from sales of residential mortgage and SBA loans originated for sale in the secondary market, commissions on sales of securities and insurance products, and real estate lease income. We also recognize income from the sale of investment securities.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
Expenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses, occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, professional service fees, federal deposit insurance premiums, advertising, net losses on foreclosed real estate and other miscellaneous expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of: salaries, wages and incentive compensation paid to our employees; payroll taxes; and expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits. We also recognize annual employee compensation expenses related to our equity incentive plans as the equity incentive awards vest. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes, office lease expense and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 40 years. Data processing expenses are the fees we pay to third parties for processing customer information, deposits and loans. Professional fees expense represents the fees we pay to third parties for legal, accounting, investment advisory and other consulting services. Federal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the FDIC to insure of our deposit accounts. Other expenses include expenses for office supplies, postage, telephone, insurance, regulatory assessments and other miscellaneous operating expenses.
Critical Accounting Policies
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made; and different estimates that the Company reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements. These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally accepted accounting principles. Significant accounting policies, including the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies considered to be the critical accounting policies are described below.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page of this annual report for additional information regarding the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses.
Valuation Methodologies. In the ordinary course of business, management applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities that often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued. Generally, in evaluating various assets for potential impairment, management compares the fair value to the carrying value. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as investment securities. However, for those items for which market-based prices do not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans held for sale, loan servicing rights, derivative financial instruments, goodwill and other intangible assets, foreclosed and other repossessed assets, estimated present value of impaired loans, value ascribed to stock-based compensation and certain other financial investments. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company’s results of operations. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page of this annual report for additional information.
Deferred Tax Assets. Income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carryback and carryforward periods, including consideration of available tax planning strategies. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page of this annual report for additional information.
Selected Financial Data
The following tables contain certain information concerning our consolidated financial position and results of operations, which is derived in part from our audited consolidated financial statements. The following is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto beginning on page of this annual report.
(1) Per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-one stock split effective September 15, 2021.
(1) Represents the difference between the weighted average yield on average interest-earning assets and the weighted average cost on average interest-bearing liabilities. Tax exempt income is reported on a tax equivalent basis using a federal marginal tax rate of 21% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, a blended federal marginal tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 and 34% for 2017.
(2) Represents net interest income as a percent of average interest-earning assets. Tax exempt income is reported on a tax equivalent basis using a federal marginal tax rate of 21% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, a blended federal tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 and 34% for 2017.
(3) Represents other expenses divided by the sum of net interest income and other income.
(4) Represents other expenses, excluding nonrecurring items as discussed below, divided by the sum of net interest income and other income, excluding income (loss) from tax credit investments discussed below. The efficiency ratio for 2021, 2020 and 2019 excludes the income from tax credit investments of $32,000, $426,000 and $210,000, respectively. The efficiency ratio for 2018 excludes the income from tax credit investments of $585,000, expenses of $1.3 million associated with the acquisition of and merger with Dearmin and FNBO, and expenses of $661,000 associated with the initial operations of the secondary-market residential mortgage lending division. The efficiency ratio for 2017 excludes the loss on tax credit investment of $226,000 and expenses of $166,000 associated with the acquisition of and merger with Dearmin and FNBO. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors in understanding the Company’s performance.
Balance Sheet Analysis
Cash and Cash Equivalents. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $33.4 million and $33.7 million, respectively. The Bank is at times required to maintain reserve balances on hand and with the Federal Reserve Bank, which are unavailable for investment but are interest-bearing.
Loans Held for Sale. Residental mortgage loans held for sale decreased by $95.6 million in 2021 due to loan sales outpacing originations. Single tenant net lease loans held for sale incresed by $23.0 million in 2021 due to a transfer from held for investment to held for sale during the year.
Loans. Our primary lending activity is the origination of loans secured by real estate. We originate one to four family mortgage loans, multifamily loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans and construction loans. To a lesser extent, we originate various consumer loans including home equity lines of credit. Net loans decreased $14.1 million, from $1.09 billion at September 30, 2020 to $1.08 billion at September 30, 2021.
At September 30, 2021, residential mortgage loans totaled $241.4 million, or 22.2% of total loans, compared to $191.8 million, or 17.3% of total loans at September 30, 2020. The increase in residential mortgage loans is primarily due to the creation of a new national first-lien home equity line of credit product during the year, which had an outstanding balance of $82.0 million at September 30, 2021, partially offset by loan refinancings and payoffs. We generally originate loans for investment purposes, although, depending on the interest rate environment, we typically sell 15-year and 30-year fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we originate into the secondary market in order to limit exposure to interest rate risk and to earn noninterest income. Management intends to continue offering short-term adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and generally sell long-term fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market.
Commercial real estate loans, including in-market commercial real estate loans, single tenant net lease loans, and SBA real commercial real estate loans, totaled $616.1 million, or 56.5% of total loans at September 30, 2021, compared to $531.7 million, or 47.9% of total loans at September 30, 2020. The increase in commercial real estate loans is primarily due to an increase in single tenant net lease loans, which increased $69.1 million during the year ended September 30, 2021. Management intends to continue to focus on pursuing commercial real estate loan opportunities, both within our primary market area as well as through the single tenant net lease and SBA loan programs, to further diversify the loan portfolio.
Multi-family real estate loans totaled $40.3 million, or 3.7% of total loans at September 30, 2021, compared to $42.4 million, or 3.8% of total loans at September 30, 2020. These loans are primarily secured by apartment buildings and other multi-tenant developments in our primary market area.
Residential construction loans totaled $8.3 million, or 0.8% of total loans at September 30, 2021, of which $3.1 million were speculative construction loans. At September 30, 2020, residential construction loans totaled $9.4 million, or 0.8% of total loans, of which $5.0 million were speculative loans.
Commercial construction loans totaled $2.7 million, or 0.3% of total loans, at September 30, 2021 compared to $6.9 million, or 0.6% of total loans at September 30, 2020.
Land and land development loans totaled $10.2 million, or 0.9% of total loans at September 30, 2021, compared to $9.4 million, or 0.9% of total loans at September 30, 2020. These loans are primarily secured by vacant lots to be improved for residential and nonresidential development, and farmland.
Commercial business loans, including in-market commercial business loans and SBA commercial business loans, totaled $140.3 million, or 12.9% of total loans, at September 30, 2021 compared to $267.3 million, or 24.1% of total loans, at September 30, 2020. In-market commercial business loans decreased $630,000 during the year due primarily to decreased commercial business lending opportunities in our primary market area. SBA commercial business loans decreased $126.4 million during the year primarily due to pay-downs and SBA PPP loan forgiveness as the outstanding balance of PPP loans decreased $123.9 million during the year. Management intends to continue to focus on pursuing commercial business loan opportunities, both within our primary market area as well as through various SBA loan programs, to further diversify the loan portfolio.
Consumer loans totaled $30.6 million, or 2.8% of total loans, at September 30, 2021 compared to $50.6 million, or 4.6% of total loans, at September 30, 2020. Consumer loans, including automobile loans, junior lien home equity lines of credit, unsecured loans and loans secured by deposits, decreased due to pay-downs, payoffs, charge-offs and management’s decision to focus on other lending opportunities with less inherent credit risk.
The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated.
Loan Maturity
The following table sets forth certain information at September 30, 2021 regarding the dollar amount of loan principal repayments becoming due during the period indicated. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments which significantly
shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below. Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less.
(1) Includes multifamily loans.
(2) Includes farmland, land and land development loans.
(3) Includes construction loans for which the Bank has committed to provide permanent financing.
Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Loans
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans at September 30, 2021 that are due after September 30, 2022, and have either fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates. The amounts shown below exclude unearned loan origination fees.
(1) Includes multifamily loans.
(2) Includes farmland, land and land development loans.
Securities Available for Sale. Our available for sale securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises securities, mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, privately-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities, and pass-through asset-backed securities guaranteed by the SBA. Available for sale securities increased by $4.7 million, from $202.0 million at September 30, 2020 to $206.7 million at September 30, 2021, due primarily to purchases of $29.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in unrealized gains of $2.9 million, principal repayments of $4.4 million and maturities and calls of $16.7 million.
Securities Held to Maturity. Our held to maturity securities portfolio consists of mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored enterprises and municipal bonds. Held to maturity securities decreased by $265,000 from $2.1 million at September 30, 2020 to $1.8 million at September 30, 2021, due primarily to maturities and principal repayments.
The following table sets forth the amortized costs and fair values of our investment securities at the dates indicated.
The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of debt securities at September 30, 2021. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax equivalent basis using a federal marginal tax rate of 21.0%. Certain mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below. Weighted average yield calculations on investments available for sale do not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of equity.
Deposits. Deposit accounts, generally obtained from individuals and businesses throughout our primary market area, are our primary source of funds for lending and investments. Our deposit accounts are comprised of noninterest-bearing accounts, interest-bearing savings, checking and money market accounts and time deposits. Deposits increased $179.5 million from $1.05 billion at September 30, 2020 to $1.23 billion at September 30, 2021. The Bank recognized increases in money market deposit accounts of $79.1 million, noninterest-bearing checking accounts of $48.4 million, interest-bearing checking accounts of $96.6 million and savings
accounts of $19.4 million, when comparing the two years. Brokered certificates of deposit totaled $70.1 million at September 30, 2021 compared to $54.7 million at September 30, 2020. Reciprocal time deposits totaled $30.0 million at September 30, 2021, compared to $77.4 million at September 30, 2020. We have continued to promote relationship oriented deposit accounts but at times also utilize brokered certificates of deposit and reciprocal time deposits as a lower cost alternative to retail time deposits. In addition, we have continued to develop and promote cash management services including sweep accounts and remote deposit capture in order to increase the level of commercial deposit accounts. We believe that the development and promotion of these products has made us more competitive in attracting commercial deposits during recent periods.
The following table sets forth the balances of our deposit accounts at the dates indicated.
The following table indicates the amount of time deposits, by account, that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000) by time remaining until maturity as of September 30, 2021.
Our uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000), were approximately $446.8 million and $310.1 million at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes.
Borrowings. We use borrowings from the FHLB consisting of advances and borrowings under a line of credit arrangement to supplement our supply of funds for loans and investments. The outstanding balance of borrowings from the FHLB decreased $60.9 million, from $310.9 million at September 30, 2020 to $250.0 million at September 30, 2021. FHLB borrowings are primarily used to fund loan demand and to purchase available for sale securities.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Bank’s use of FHLB borrowings.
On September 20, 2018, the Company entered into a subordinated note purchase agreement in the principal amount of $20 million. The subordinated note initially bears a fixed interest rate of 6.02% per year through September 30, 2023, and thereafter a floating rate, reset quarterly, equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 310 basis points. All interest is payable quarterly and the subordinated
note is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2028. The subordinated note is an unsecured subordinated obligation of the Company and may be repaid in whole or in part, without penalty, on or after September 30, 2023. The subordinated note is intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Company under regulatory guidelines. The subordinated note had a carrying value of $19.9 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $135,000, at September 30, 2021.
The Bank has entered into federal funds purchased line of credit facilities with three other financial institutions that established lines of credit not to exceed the lesser of $20 million or 25% of the Bank’s equity capital, excluding reserves, $22 million and $15 million, respectively. At September 30, 2021, the Bank did not have any outstanding federal funds purchased under these lines of credit.
In April 2020, the Company began utilizing the Federal Reserve PPP Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”). The proceeds from the PPPLF were used to fund certain PPP loans, which were pledged as collateral to secure the borrowings. The Company had no borrowings under the PPPLF at September 30, 2021 due to full repayment during the year.
Stockholders’ Equity. Stockholders’ equity increased $23.1 million, from $157.3 million at September 30, 2020 to $180.4 million at September 30, 2021. The increase is due to retained net income of $27.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2021, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the market value of available-for-sale securities and a $1.8 million reduction in additional paid-in capital, primarily due to the purchase of the minority interests in Q2.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019
Overview. The Company reported net income of $29.6 million ($4.12 per common share diluted) for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to net income of $33.4 million ($4.68 per common share diluted) for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in net income was due to a decrease in noninterest income of $12.9 million and an increase in noninterest expense of $13.6 million, partially offset by a $10.0 million increase in net interest income and a $9.7 million reduction in the provision for loan losses.
Net income was $33.4 million ($4.68 per common share diluted) for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to net income of $16.2 million ($2.27 per common share diluted) for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in net income for 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in net interest income of $9.3 million and noninterest income of $87.3 million, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $63.4 million.
Net Interest Income. For the year ended September 30, 2021, net interest income increased $10.0 million or 21.2%, as compared to 2020, primarily as the result of an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets. The interest rate spread, the difference between the average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, increased from 3.37% for 2020 to 3.54% for 2021 due primarily to a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 0.96% for 2020 to 0.64% for 2021. This was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets from 4.33% for 2020 to 4.18% for 2021.
For the year ended September 30, 2020, net interest income increased $7.1 million or 17.6% as compared to 2019, primarily as the result of an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets. The interest rate spread decreased from 3.63% for 2019 to 3.37% for 2020 due primarily to a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets from 4.91% for 2019 to 4.33% for 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 1.28% for 2019 to 0.96% for 2020.
For the year ended September 30, 2021, total interest income increased $7.6 million, or 13.1%, as compared to 2020. The increase in total interest income is due primarily to increases in the average balance of interest earning assets of $230.2 million, from $1.36 billion for 2020 to $1.59 billion for 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets, from 4.33% for 2020 to 4.18% for 2021. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets primarily relates to increases in the average balance of loans of $223.9 million. For the year ended September 30, 2020, total interest income increased $6.7 million, or 13.1%, from $51.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 to $57.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in total interest income is due primarily to increases in the average balance of interest earning assets of $301.0 million, from $1.06 billion for 2019 to $1.36 billion for 2020, partially offset by a decrease in the average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets from 4.91% for 2019 to 4.33% for 2020. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets primarily relates to increases in the average balance of loans of $283.7 million.
Interest income on loans increased $7.9 million, or 15.8%, from $50.2 million for 2020 to $58.1 million for 2021, due primarily to an increase in the average balance of loans outstanding of $223.9 million, from $1.11 billion for 2020 to $1.34 billion for 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average tax-equivalent yield on loans from 4.52% for 2020 to 4.35% for 2021. Excluding PPP loans, which have a fixed interest rate of 1.00%, the average tax-equivalent yield on loans decreased from 4.67% for 2020 to 4.40% for 2021 and the average outstanding balance of loans increased $154.6 million for 2021 compared to 2020. In 2020, interest income on loans increased $7.5 million, or 17.5%, from $42.7 million for 2019 to $50.2 million for 2020, due primarily to an increase in the average balance of loans outstanding of $283.7 million, from $828.8 million for 2019 to $1.11 billion for 2020, partially offset by a decrease in the average tax-equivalent yield on loans from 5.16% for 2019 to 4.52% for 2020. Excluding PPP loans, which have a fixed interest rate of 1.00%, the average tax-equivalent yield on loans decreased from 5.16% for 2019 to 4.67% for 2020 and the average outstanding balance of loans increased $209.8 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in the average balance of loans outstanding for both 2021 and 2020 is due primarily to an increase in commercial real estate mortgage loans, as a result of increased single tenant net lease program originations.
Interest income on investment securities decreased $8,000, or 0.1%, primarily due to a decrease in the average tax equivalent yield on investments from 4.05% for 2020 to 4.04% for 2021 slightly offset by an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $2.2 million, from $189.5 million for 2020 to $191.7 million for 2021. In 2020, interest income on investment securities decreased $301,000, or 4.4%, from $6.8 million for 2019 to $6.5 million for 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the average tax equivalent yield on investments from 4.32% for 2019 to 4.05% for 2020. The decrease in tax equivalent yield was partially offset by an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $7.5 million, from $182.0 million for 2019 to $189.5 million for 2020.
Total interest expense decreased $2.5 million, or 23.3%, due primarily to a decrease in the average cost of funds from 0.96% for 2020 to 0.64% for 2021, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $162.9 million, from $1.10 billion for 2020 to $1.27 billion for 2021. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $89.7 million, or 11.8%, from $759.2 million for 2020 to $848.8 million for 2021, and the average cost of funds for deposits was 0.75% for 2020 compared to 0.38% for 2021. The average balance of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $21.8 million, or 8.4%, from $260.2 million for 2020 to $282.0 million for 2021, and the average cost of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased from 1.29% for 2020 to 1.13% for 2021. Average other borrowings, which are comprised of subordinated debt was $19.8 million for both 2020 and 2021. The average cost of other borrowings decreased from 6.63% for 2020, net of amortization of debt issuance costs, to 6.53% for 2021, net of amortization of debt issuance costs. In 2020, total interest expense decreased $368,000, or 3.4%, due primarily to a decrease in the average cost of funds from 1.28% for 2019 to 0.96% for 2020, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $252.4 million, from $849.6 million for 2019 to $1.10 billion for 2020. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $73.8 million, or 10.8%, from $685.4 million for 2019 to $759.2 million for 2020, and the average cost of funds for deposits was 1.01% for 2019 compared to 0.75% for 2020. The average balance of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $116.7 million, or 81.3%, from $143.5 million for 2019 to $260.2 million for 2020, and the average cost of funds for Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased from 1.87% for 2019 to 1.29% for 2020. Average other borrowings, which are comprised of subordinated debt, increased from $19.7 million for 2019 to $19.8 million for 2020. The average cost of other borrowings increased from 6.48% for 2019, net of amortization of debt issuance costs, to 6.63% for 2020, net of amortization of debt issuance costs.
Average Balances and Yields.
The following tables present information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and totaled $4.7 million, $1.8 million and $753,000 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Tax exempt income on loans and investment securities has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using a federal marginal tax rate of 21.0%.
Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. Changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume have been allocated proportionally based on the absolute dollar amounts of change in each.
Provision for Loan Losses. The Company recognized a credit for loan losses of $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to a provision of $8.0 million for 2020. The credit for loan losses for the year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily the result of decreases in certain segments of the loan portfolio as well as reductions of certain qualitative risk factors within the allowance for loan losses calculation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Net charge-offs in 2021 were $958,000 compared to $976,000 for 2020 and nonperforming loans increased $1.9 million to $15.5 million at September 30, 2021. In 2020, the provision for loan losses increased $6.5 million, or 444.2%, from $1.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 to $8.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 due primarily to an increase in total loans of $289.3 million, an increase in nonperforming loans for the year and changes to qualitative factors within the allowance for loan losses calculation related to economic uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Net charge-offs in 2020 were $976,000 compared to $746,000 for 2019 and nonperforming loans increased $8.4 million to $13.6 million at September 30, 2020. The consistent application of management’s allowance for loan losses methodology resulted in a decrease in the level of the allowance for loan losses for 2021. See “Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets” included herein. It is management’s assessment that the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2021 was adequate and appropriately reflected the probable incurred losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio at that date.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $12.9 million, or 9.7%, from $133.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 to $120.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in mortgage banking income of $16.2 million, partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in net gain on sales of SBA loans. The decrease in mortgage banking income is due to decreased loan originations and sales by the mortgage banking segment, as well as margin compression in the residential mortgage loan secondary market. The increase in net gain on sales of SBA loans was due primarily to increases in production and sales volume from the SBA lending segment, as well as higher premiums in the secondary market. In 2020, noninterest income increased $89.5 million, or 204.8%, from $43.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 to $133.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was due primarily to increases in mortgage banking income of $87.7 million and net gain on sales of SBA loans of $1.1 million. The increase in mortgage banking income is due to production from the secondary-market residential mortgage lending
segment that commenced operations in April 2018. Net gains on the sale of SBA loans increased primarily due to increased production and sales volume from the SBA lending segment.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expenses increased $13.6 million, or 10.8%, from $125.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 to $139.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits and professional fees of $10.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The increase in compensation and benefits expense is attributable to the addition of new employees primarily to support the growth of the Company’s mortgage banking, core banking and SBA lending activities, and normal salary and benefits adjustments. In 2020, noninterest expenses increased $63.4 million, or 101.6%, from $62.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 to $125.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits, advertising expense and other operating expenses of $50.0 million, $4.6 million, $4.2 million, respectively. The increase in compensation and benefits expense is attributable to the addition of new employees primarily to support the growth of the Company’s mortgage banking and SBA lending activities, routine salary and benefits adjustments, and increased incentive compensation as a result of the Company’s performance. The increases in advertising expense and other operating expenses are primarily due to the mortgage banking segment.
Income Tax Expense. The Company recognized income tax expense of $10.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to $12.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 and $3.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The effective tax rate was 25.0%, 27.1% and 15.4%, for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to the result of lower pretax income in 2021 and lower nondeductible executive compensation in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to increases in pre-tax income and nondeductible executive compensation.
Risk Management
Overview. Managing risk is essential to successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Other risks that we face are operational risks, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue or in the value of our common stock. The Company has implemented an enterprise risk management structure in order to better manage and mitigate these identified and perceived risks.
Credit Risk Management. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans.
When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. When the loan becomes 15 days past due, a late notice is sent to the borrower and a late fee is assessed. When the loan becomes 30 days past due, a more formal letter is sent. Between 15 and 30 days past due, telephone calls are also made to the borrower. After 30 days, we regard the borrower as in default. The borrower may be sent a letter from our attorney and we may commence collection proceedings. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. Generally, when a consumer loan becomes 60 days past due, we institute collection proceedings and attempt to repossess any personal property that secures the loan. Generally, we institute foreclosure proceedings when a loan is 60 days past due. Management obtains the approval of the Board of Directors to proceed with foreclosure of property. Management informs the Board of Directors monthly of all loans in nonaccrual status, all loans in foreclosure and all repossessed property and assets that we own.
Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets. We consider nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), repossessed assets and loans that are 90 days or more past due to be nonperforming assets. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations. Typically, payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance.
Real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at its fair market value, less estimated costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure. Holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income. Former bank premises held for sale are also included in other real estate owned, but are not included in the nonperforming asset totals below.
The following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. Included in nonperforming loans are loans for which the Bank has modified the repayment terms, and therefore are considered to be TDRs. The Bank had 22 TDRs, totaling $1.7 million, which were performing according to their terms and on accrual status as of September 30, 2021.
Federal and state banking regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis. In addition, the Bank’s regulators have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. “Substandard assets” must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. “Doubtful assets” have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution, without establishment of a specific allowance or charge-off, is not warranted. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” category, described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. When we classify an asset as doubtful we may establish a specific allowance for loan losses. If we classify an asset as loss, we charge off an amount equal to 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss.
Classified assets include loans that are classified due to factors other than payment delinquencies, such as lack of current financial statements and other required documentation, insufficient cash flows or other deficiencies, and, therefore, are not included as nonperforming assets. Other than as disclosed in the above tables, there are no other loans where management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Classified assets also include investment securities that have experienced a downgrade of the security’s credit quality rating by various rating agencies.
At September 30, 2021, the Company held ten privately-issued CMO and ABS securities with an aggregate amortized cost of $512,000 and fair value of $526,000 that have been downgraded to a substandard regulatory classification due to a downgrade of the security’s credit quality rating by various rating agencies. Based on an independent third party analysis, the Bank expects to collect the contractual principal and interest cash flows for these securities and, as a result, no other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized on the privately-issued CMO or ABS portfolios. At September 30, 2020, the Company held twelve privately-issued CMO and ABS securities with an aggregate carrying value of $918,000 and fair value of $986,000 that had been downgraded to a substandard regulatory classification due to a downgrade of the security’s credit quality rating by various rating agencies.
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on at least a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance for impaired loans and a general allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio.
Specific Allowance for Impaired Loans. We consider loans classified as substandard or doubtful and TDRs to be impaired and establish a specific allowance when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan.
General Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not currently classified as impaired in order to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities. The general allowance covers unimpaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in the volume of past due and nonaccrual loans and classified assets, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations of credit, and other factors.
The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated.
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. The banking regulators may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Analysis of Loan Loss Experience. The following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
The following table sets forth the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding for the periods indicated.
Interest Rate Risk Management. We manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of our earnings, we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes: adjusting the maturities of borrowings; adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration and generally selling in the secondary market substantially all newly originated, fixed rate one-to four-family residential real estate loans. We currently do not participate in hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments, other than the use of forward mortgage loan sale contracts in connection with our mortgage banking activities. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page of this annual report for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments.
We have an Asset/Liability Management Committee, which includes members of management selected by the Board of Directors, to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset/liability management. The committee establishes and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals.
Our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income.
Market Risk Analysis. An element in our ongoing interest rate risk management process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a Net Interest Income at Risk simulation to model the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet and to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the Company. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over a one-year horizon. The model assumes a semi-static balance sheet and measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical changes in interest rates over twelve months and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements. The scenarios include prepayment assumptions, changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and spreads between market interest rates in order to capture the impact from re-pricing, yield curve, option, and basis risks.
Results of our simulation modeling, which assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates, project that the Company’s net interest income could change as follows over a one-year horizon, relative to our base case scenario, based on September 30, 2021 and 2020 financial information.
At September 30, 2021, our simulated exposure to an increase in interest rates shows that an immediate and sustained increase in rates of 1.00% will increase our net interest income by $387,000 or 0.82% over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario. Furthermore, rate increases of 2.00% and 3.00% would cause net interest income to decrease by 3.21% and 7.65%, respectively. An immediate and sustained decrease in rates of 1.00% will decrease our net interest income by $1.6 million, or 3.48%, over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario.
The Company also has longer term interest rate risk exposure, which may not be appropriately measured by Net Interest Income at Risk modeling, and therefore uses an Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) interest rate sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the impact of its interest rate risk on earnings and capital. This is measured by computing the changes in net EVE for its cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. EVE modeling involves discounting present values of all cash flows for on and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents the Company’s EVE and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. The amount of base case EVE and its sensitivity to shifts in interest rates provide a measure of the longer term re-pricing and option risk in the balance sheet.
Results of our simulation modeling, which assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates, project that the Company’s EVE could change as follows, relative to our base case scenario, based on September 30, 2021 and 2020 financial information.
The previous table indicates that at September 30, 2021, the Company would expect an increase in its EVE in the event of a sudden and sustained 100, 200 and 300 basis point increase in prevailing interest rates, and a decrease in its EVE in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 basis point decrease in prevailing interest rates.
The models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect the Company’s net interest income and EVE. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes. Therefore, as with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables and it is recognized that the model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table.
Liquidity Management. Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future short-term financial obligations. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
The Bank regularly adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management policy.
The Bank’s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $33.4 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, amounting to $206.7 million, at September 30, 2021, provide additional sources of liquidity. At September 30, 2021, we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately $394.0 million from the FHLB, of which $250.0 million was borrowed and outstanding. In addition, we had the ability to borrow the lesser of $20 million or 25% of the Bank’s equity capital, excluding reserves, using a federal funds purchased line of credit facility with another financial institution at September 30, 2021. We also had two other federal funds line of credit facilities with other financial institutions from which we had the ability to borrow an additional $22 and $15 million, respectively. The Bank did not have any outstanding federal funds purchased at September 30, 2021.
At September 30, 2021, the Bank had $192.8 million in commitments to extend credit outstanding, excluding interest rate lock commitments for residential mortgage loans intended for sale in the secondary market that meet the definition of a derivative. Time deposits due within one year of September 30, 2021 totaled $189.0 million, or 80.0% of time deposits. We believe the large percentage of time deposits that mature within one year reflects customers’ hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods due to the recent low interest rate environment and local competitive pressure. The balance also includes $70.1 million in brokered time deposits and $30.0 million in reciprocal time deposits at September 30, 2021. If these maturing time deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the time deposits due on or before September 30,
2022. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our time deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations, to pay any dividends and to repurchase any of its outstanding common stock. The Company’s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from banking regulators, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. At September 30, 2021, the Company had liquid assets of $6.9 million on a stand-alone, unconsolidated basis.
Our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities. Our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and FHLB borrowings. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors. We generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive. Occasionally, we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits.
Capital Management. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At September 30, 2021, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See “Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision - Regulation of Federal Savings Associations - Capital Requirement.”
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit.
For the year ended September 30, 2021, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
