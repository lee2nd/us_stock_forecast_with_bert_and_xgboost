ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes beginning on page. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties because they are based on current expectations and relate to future events and our future financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements because of many important factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
GeoVax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases using a novel vector vaccine platform (Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Virus Like Particle or “GV-MVA-VLP™”). During January 2020, we began a program to develop a vaccine for prevention of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. That effort has resulted in four COVID-19 vaccine candidates. These COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been designed and constructed and are being tested using relevant experimental animal challenge models. Additional development programs are focused on preventive and therapeutic vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); preventive vaccines against hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Lassa fever), Zika virus and malaria; as well as immunotherapies for solid tumor cancers.
For our infectious disease vaccines, our recombinant MVA vector expresses target proteins on highly immunogenic VLPs in the person being vaccinated, with the intended result of producing durable immune responses with the safety characteristics of the replication deficient MVA vector and cost-effective manufacturing.
In cancer immunotherapy, we believe that stimulating the immune system to treat or prevent cancers is a compelling concept and that the opportunity for immune-activating technologies is promising, especially in light of advancements such as checkpoint inhibitors leading the way in oncology. Despite drug approvals in limited indications and promising results in clinical trials, there remains a significant need and opportunity for further advancements. We believe our GV-MVA-VLP™ platform is well-suited for delivery of tumor-associated antigens and we plan to pursue development of our platform in this space.
Our most advanced vaccine program is focused on prevention of the clade B subtype of HIV prevalent in the regions of the Americas, Western Europe, Japan and Australia; our HIV vaccine candidate, GOVX-B11, will be included in an upcoming clinical trial (HVTN 132) managed by the HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials Network (HVTN) with support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is targeted to begin in late 2021. Additionally, during August 2020 a consortium led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) began a clinical trial using our vaccine as part of a combinational therapy to induce remission in HIV-positive individuals. Through the efforts of our collaborator, American Gene Technologies International, Inc. (AGT), we expect that our HIV vaccine will also enter clinical trials during 2021 in combination with AGT’s gene therapy technology to seek a functional cure for HIV. Our other vaccine and immunotherapy programs are at various other stages of development.
Our corporate strategy is to advance, protect and exploit our differentiated vaccine/immunotherapy platform leading to the successful development of preventive and therapeutic vaccines against infectious diseases and various cancers. With our design and development capabilities, we are progressing and validating an array of cancer and infectious disease immunotherapy and vaccine product candidates. Our goal is to advance products through to human clinical testing, and to seek partnership or licensing arrangements for achieving regulatory approval and commercialization. We also leverage third party resources through collaborations and partnerships for preclinical and clinical testing with multiple government, academic and corporate entities.
We have not generated any revenues from the sale of the products we are developing, and we do not expect to generate any such revenues for at least the next several years. Our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing. All product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use and will require significant costs for commercialization. We may not be successful in our research and development efforts, and we may never generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and adjusts them as necessary. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are included in this Form 10-K. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which created a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Grant revenue - We receive payments from government entities under non-refundable grants in support of our vaccine development programs. We record revenue associated with these grants when the reimbursable costs are incurred and we have complied with all conditions necessary to receive the grant funds.
Research collaborations - From time to time, we may enter into collaborative research and development agreements for specific vaccine development approaches and/or disease indications whereby we receive third-party funding for preclinical research under certain of these arrangements. Each agreement is evaluated in accordance with the process defined by ASU 2014-09 and revenue is recognized accordingly.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based transactions in which the Company receives services from employees, directors or others in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the grant date. Stock-based compensation cost for awards of common stock is estimated based on the price of the underlying common stock on the date of issuance. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options or warrants is estimated at the grant date based on each instrument’s fair value as calculated by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recognize stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the award. See Note 8 to our financial statements for additional stock-based compensation information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal uses of cash are to finance our research and development activities. Since inception, we have funded these activities primarily from government grants and clinical trial assistance, and from sales of our equity and debt securities. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9,883,796 and total assets of $10,393,899, as compared to $283,341 and $468,880, respectively, at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $9,424,839, compared to a working capital deficit of $1,568,929 at December 31, 2019.
Net cash used in operating activities was $2,750,570 and $1,398,497 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Generally, the variances between periods are due to fluctuations in our net losses, offset by non-cash charges such as depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, and by net changes in our assets and liabilities. Our net losses generally fluctuate based on expenditures for our research activities, partially offset by government grant revenues. See “Results of Operations - Grant and Collaboration Revenues” below for additional details concerning our government grants.
NIAID has funded the costs of conducting all of our human clinical trials (Phase 1 and Phase 2a) to date for our preventive HIV vaccines, with GeoVax incurring certain costs associated with manufacturing the clinical vaccine supplies and other study support. We expect that NIAID will also fund the cost of the planned Phase 1 trial (HVTN 132) to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of adding “protein boost” components to our vaccine, GOVX-B11. We expect HVTN 132 to commence patient enrollment during 2021. Additionally, we are party to a collaboration with American Gene Technologies International, Inc. (AGT) whereby AGT intends to conduct a Phase 1 human clinical trial with our combined technologies, with the ultimate goal of developing a functional cure for HIV infection. AGT began the Phase 1 trial in late 2020, and we expect the addition of our vaccine into the trial during 2021. A similar effort is underway with a consortium led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), using our vaccine as part of a combinational therapy to induce remission in HIV-positive individuals; this program entered clinical trials during August 2020. Each of these programs could experience delays as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Net cash used in investing activities was $156,791 and $7,606 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our investing activities have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures for laboratory equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $12,507,816 and $1,429,743 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2020 relates to (i) the sale in January 2020 of shares of our Series J Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $300,000, (ii) $170,200 of PPP loan proceeds received in April 2020 (see discussion below), (iii) $888,500 of net proceeds received in June 2020 from our issuance of Convertible Debentures (see discussion below) (iv) net proceeds of approximately $11.2 million received in September 2020 from the public offering of our equity securities (see discussion below), (v) $2,500 of net proceeds from the exercise of warrants, and (vi) $11,880 in principal repayments toward the GRA Note. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2019 relates to the sale of shares of our Series G and Series I convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of $1,440,000 and $10,257 in principal repayments toward the GRA Note.
PPP Loan. On April 17, 2020, we received a $170,200 bank loan backed by the United States Small Business Administration pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) provisions of the CARES Act. The loan bears an annual interest rate of one percent and is due April 17, 2022. In October 2020, we applied to the lender to have the loan forgiven, based upon our submission of qualifying information regarding eligible expenses; as of the date of this report our forgiveness application has not been processed.
Issuance of Convertible Debenture and Subsequent Conversion to Equity. On June 26 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with two institutional investors, pursuant to which we received gross proceeds of $1,050,000 in exchange for the issuance of: (i) 5% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (the “Convertible Debentures”) in the aggregate principal amount of $1,200,000; and (ii) five-year warrants (the “June 2020 Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 120,000 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $10.00 per share. Net proceeds after deducting the original issue discount, finder’s fee and other debt issuance costs were $888,500.
The Convertible Debentures were mandatorily convertible upon our consummation of a public offering of common stock with gross proceeds of $6,000,000 or more, and which resulted in the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange (a “Qualified Offering”). The conversion price upon the occurrence of a Qualified Offering was equal to the lower of (i) $10.00 per share or (ii) 80% of the offering price. The conversion provisions of the Convertible Debentures were subject to a “conversion blocker” such that each of the purchasers could not convert the Convertible Debentures to the extent that the conversion would result in the purchaser and its affiliates holding more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock.
Upon our consummation of the public offering discussed below, the $1,200,000 maturity value of the Convertible Debentures and $14,667 of accrued interest were automatically converted at $4.00, the Qualified Offering discounted price, resulting in the issuance of 303,668 conversion units. Of the 303,668 conversion units: (a) 177,626 consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock (a “Conversion Warrant”), and (b) 126,042 consisted of one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock (a “Pre-Funded Warrant”) and a Conversion Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants provided the holder the right to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and were exercised in full in January 2021. The Conversion Warrants provide the holder the right to purchase one share of common stock, are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and expire five years after the issuance date. As a result of the public offering the exercise price of the June 2020 Warrants was reduced to $5.00.
Public Offerings - On September 29, 2020, we closed an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of an aggregate of 2,560,000 units of our equity securities (the “Units”), with gross proceeds to us of approximately $12.8 million. Net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses were approximately $11.2 million.
Of the 2,560,000 Units sold in the Offering: (a) 2,310,000 Units consisting of one share of our common stock, and a Warrant to purchase one share of common stock (each, a “Unit Warrant”); and (b) 250,000 Units consisting of a Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase one share of common stock and a Unit Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants provided the holder the right to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and were exercised in full during October 2020. The Unit Warrants provide the holder the right to purchase one share of common stock, are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and expire five years after the issuance date. The public offering price was $5.00 per Unit ($4.99 for each Unit including a Pre-Funded Warrant).
Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we issued to the representative of the underwriters, as a portion of the underwriting compensation, warrants to purchase up to a total of 128,000 shares of common stock (the “Representative Warrants”). The Representative Warrants have an exercise price of $5.50 per share, are initially exercisable 180 days after the effective date of the Offering and have a term of three years from their initial exercise date.
On February 11, 2021, we closed an underwritten bought deal public offering of 1,644,000 shares of our common stock, including 204,000 shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $6.25 per share. Net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses were approximately $9.4 million
2021 Warrant Exercises - During January and February 2021, holders of our warrants exercised 62,626 Series I Warrants, 126,042 Pre-Funded Warrants and 690,034 Unit Warrants, resulting in the issuance of 835,900 shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds to us of $3,174,156.
Conversion of Deferred Compensation to Equity - From 2016 through August 2020, to help conserve the Company’s cash resources, our executive officers and non-employee directors agreed to defer receipt of all or a portion (at varying levels) of their respective cash compensation. On September 29, 2020, upon our consummation of the Offering, $1,500,000 of the accumulated deferrals were converted at the $5.00 offering price, resulting in the issuance of 300,001 units substantially similar to the units sold in the public offering, with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one warrant substantially similar to a Unit Warrant (a “Management Warrant”). The Company also paid the executive officers and non-employee directors $525,198 of the deferred compensation in cash.
As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $45.8 million. We expect for the foreseeable future we will continue to operate at a loss. The amount of the accumulated deficit will continue to increase, as it will be expensive to continue our research and development efforts. We will continue to require substantial funds to continue our activities and cannot predict the outcome of our efforts. We believe that our existing cash resources, combined with funding from existing government grants and clinical trial support, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into 2023. We may require additional funds to continue our planned operations beyond that date. We are currently seeking sources of capital through additional government grant programs and clinical trial support, and we plan to conduct additional offerings of our equity securities. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all and if we fail to obtain additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs as well as reduce our general and administrative expenses.
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
At December 31, 2020, we had consolidated net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of $61.8 million, of which approximately $53.6 million will expire in 2021 through 2037 if not utilized. We also have research and development tax credits of approximately $1.2 million available to reduce income taxes, if any, which will expire in 2022 through 2040 if not utilized. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that may limit our utilization of net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in any given year as a result of significant changes in ownership interests that have occurred in past periods or may occur in future periods.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are likely or reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, other than the operating lease for our office and laboratory space.
Results of Operations
We recorded net losses of $2,958,068 and $2,370,629 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our operating results typically fluctuate due to the timing of activities and related costs associated with our research and development activities and our general and administrative costs, as described below.
Grant and Collaboration Revenues
We recorded grant and collaboration revenues of $1,823,658 and $1,175,896 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Grant Revenues - Our grant revenues relate to grants and contracts from agencies of the U.S. government in support of our vaccine development activities, and such revenues were 79% and 84% of our total revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively. We record revenue associated with these grants as the related costs and expenses are incurred. The variance in our grant revenues from period to period relates to the timing and amount of our expenditures for activities supported by the grants. Additional detail concerning our grant revenues and the remaining funds available for use as of December 31, 2020 is presented in the table below.
Collaboration Revenues - In addition to the grant revenues above, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded revenues of $385,193 and $192,214 associated with several research collaborations with third parties. These were 21% and 16% of our revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses were $2,444,459 and $1,910,715 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Research and development expense for these periods includes stock-based compensation expense of $7,156 and $43,801 for 2020 and 2019, respectively (see discussion under “Stock-Based Compensation Expense” below).
Our research and development expenses can fluctuate considerably on a period-to-period basis, depending on the timing of expenditures related to our government grants and other research projects, and other factors. Research and development expenses increased by $533,744, or 28% from 2019 to 2020. The fluctuation is primarily due to the timing of expenditures related to our government grants. Our research and development costs do not include costs incurred by the HVTN in conducting clinical trials of our preventive HIV vaccines; those costs are funded directly to the HVTN by NIAID.
We do not disclose our research and development expenses by project, since our employees’ time is spread across multiple programs and our laboratory facility is used for multiple vaccine candidates. We track the direct cost of research and development expenses related to government grant revenue by the percentage of assigned employees’ time spent on each grant and other direct costs associated with each grant. Indirect costs associated with grants are not tracked separately but are applied based on a contracted overhead rate negotiated with the NIH. Therefore, the recorded revenues associated with government grants approximate the costs incurred.
We expect our research and development costs to increase as we continue development of our various programs and as we move toward later stages of development, especially with regard to clinical trials. We do not provide forward-looking estimates of costs and time to complete our research programs due to the many uncertainties associated with vaccine development. Due to these uncertainties, our future expenditures are likely to be highly volatile in future periods depending on the outcomes of the trials and studies. As we obtain data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay vaccine development programs to focus our resources on more promising vaccine candidates. Completion of preclinical studies and human clinical trials may take several years or more, but the length of time can vary substantially depending upon several factors. The duration and the cost of future clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of the project because of differences arising during development of the human clinical trial protocols, including the number of patients that ultimately participate in the clinical trial; the duration of patient follow-up that seems appropriate in view of the results; the number of clinical sites included in the clinical trials; and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses were $2,196,014 and $1,637,674 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. General and administrative costs include officers’ salaries, legal and accounting costs, patent costs, and other general corporate expenses. General and administrative expense includes stock-based compensation expense of $57,307 and $283,699 for 2020 and 2019, respectively (see discussion under “Stock-Based Compensation Expense” below). Excluding stock-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses were $2,138,707 and $1,353,975 for 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $784,732 or 58%. The increase from 2019 to 2020 is primarily related to higher legal fees, patent costs, investor relations consulting, and personnel costs. We expect that our general and administrative costs will increase in the future in support of expanded research and development activities and other general corporate activities.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
For the two years ended December 31, 2020, the components of stock-based compensation expense were as follows:
As a result of the reverse stock splits enacted in April 2019 and in January 2020, we made adjustments and retroactive restatements to all of our outstanding stock options such that the balances in January 2020 were negligible. We therefore recorded no stock-based compensation expense related to our stock option plan for the majority of 2020. We re-initiated employee stock option grants in December 2020 and recorded a proportionate amount of expense for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In general, stock-based compensation expense is allocated to research and development expense or general and administrative expense according to the classification of cash compensation paid to the employee, consultant or director to whom the stock compensation was granted. For the two years ended December 31, 2020, stock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows:
Other Income (Expense)
Interest income was $2,271 and $6,359 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variances between years are primarily attributable to the cash available for investment and to interest rate fluctuations.
Interest expense was $143,524 and $4,495 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest expense relates to the Convertible Debentures, GRA Note, PPP Loan, and financing costs associated with insurance premiums. For 2020, interest expense included $14,667 of accrued interest payable and $124,185 of amortized debt discount related to the Convertible Debentures. Subsequent to the full conversion of the Convertible Debentures into our equity securities on September 29, 2020, there will be no more interest expense associated with the Convertible Debentures, and we expect other interest expense will be minimal.
Impact of Inflation
For the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, we do not believe that inflation and changing prices had a material impact on our operations or on our financial results.
