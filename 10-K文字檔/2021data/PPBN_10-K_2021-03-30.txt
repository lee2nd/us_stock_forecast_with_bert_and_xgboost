Information about the Effects of and Responses to COVID-19
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to impact Pinnacle and its customers, employees, communities and service providers, but the ultimate severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, its duration and the extent of its impact on First National Bank’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects remains uncertain.
Pandemic Guidelines and Business Continuity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pinnacle and First National Bank have placed an emphasis on delivering products and services through online and mobile banking, remote deposit capture, and digital communications with customers.
Pinnacle and First National Bank have implemented a set of pandemic guidelines to protect employees and promote business continuity while providing support to its customers and communities facing challenges due to the impacts of COVID-19. These guidelines include policies and procedures with respect to Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 responses to COVID-19 pandemic, additional cleaning and sanitation requirements, and branch-specific response plans for employees and customer service at First National Bank’s branch locations, including remote work and social distancing requirements. Pinnacle has purchased additional laptops, invested in additional technology and software, and purchased personal protective equipment for employee use. Pinnacle management meets regularly to review the pandemic guidelines, response priorities, guidance issued by health regulatory agencies, and protective measures and other actions being taken by Pinnacle and First National Bank.
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). As a further part of Pinnacle’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, First National Bank has participated in the PPP established pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (also known as the “CARES Act”), as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “CAA”), and implemented by the U.S. Small Business Administration with support from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. First National Bank has provided over $42,000 of PPP loans to small businesses in its markets.
Acquisition of Virginia Bank Bankshares, Inc.
On October 30, 2020, Pinnacle completed its merger (the “Merger”) with Virginia Bank Bankshares, Inc. (or “Virginia Bank). The Merger was effected pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between Pinnacle and Virginia Bank, effective January 21, 2020 and as amended on June 9, 2020, and the related plan of merger (collectively, the “Merger Agreement”). Under the Merger Agreement, Virginia Bank shareholders had the opportunity to elect to receive either $16.00 of cash (the “Cash Consideration”) or 0.5400 shares of Pinnacle common stock (the “Stock Consideration”) for each share of Virginia Bank common stock held, subject to the limitation that 60% of the shares will be exchanged for the Stock Consideration and 40% of the shares will be exchanged for the Cash Consideration.
For additional information about the Merger, see Note 2 to Pinnacle’s consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The above description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement which is included as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated by reference herein.
Executive Summary
Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Pinnacle generated net income of $3,062 for 2020 which represents a $1,334 or 30.35% decrease as compared to net income of $4,396 for 2019. The decrease as compared to the prior year, which was mainly driven by higher noninterest expense. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to $2,889 in expenses associated with Pinnacle’s merger with Virginia Bank, which closed on October 30, 2020, as well as higher salaries and employee benefits related to strategic growth initiatives to include the Bank’s Downtown Lynchburg Branch and its Charlottesville Loan Production Office.
Profitability as measured by Pinnacle’s return on average assets (“ROA”) was 0.52% for 2020, which is a 40 basis points decrease from the 0.92% produced in 2019. Correspondingly, return on average equity (“ROE”) also decreased in 2020 to 6.99%, compared to 9.86% for the prior year.
Total assets as of December 31, 2020 were $860,514, up 71.92% from $500,530 as of December 31, 2019. The principal components of Pinnacle’s assets as of December 31, 2020 were $564,316 in total gross loans, $46,741 in securities and $210,814 in cash and cash equivalents. During 2020, total loans increased 43.40%, or $170,796 from $393,520 as of December 31, 2019, while securities increased 3.97% or $1,783 from $44,958. Consequently, cash and cash equivalents increased 540.71% or $177,911 from $32,903 as of December 31, 2019 due mainly to an influx of deposits, the liquidation of Virginia Bank’s securities portfolio, which is in the process of being reinvested, and additional liquidity resulting from the merger. Loans increased primarily due to the addition of approximately $154,000 in loans purchased in the merger which included $13,503 in PPP loans. Additionally, First National Bank originated $28,208 in PPP loans in 2020. These increases in loans were partially offset by a few large payoffs of commercial loans and a lower volume of consumer and residential loan originations made in 2020.
Total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were $802,184, up $345,071, or 76.27%, from $455,085 as of December 31, 2019. Higher levels of deposits drove the increase in liabilities. Approximately $211,000 of the deposit growth resulted from new accounts acquired through the merger with Virginia Bank. Additional deposit growth was the result of federal government stimulus in response to the pandemic, an overall “flight to safety” by depositors and relationships that moved to the Bank as a result of branch closures in the Bank’s markets served by larger national financial institutions.
Total stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020 was $58,330 and consisted primarily of $44,509 in retained earnings. In comparison, as of December 31, 2019, total stockholders’ equity was $45,445. Both Pinnacle and First National Bank remain “well capitalized” per all regulatory definitions.
Overview of 2020
Total assets as of December 31, 2020 were $860,514, up 71.92% from $500,530 as of December 31, 2019. The principal components of Pinnacle’s assets at the end of 2020 were $210,814 in cash and cash equivalents, $46,741 in securities and $560,078 in net loans. During 2020, net loans increased 43.67% or $170,230. Pinnacle’s lending activities are a principal source of income. Loans increased primarily due to the addition of approximately $154,000 in loans purchased in the merger, which included $13,503 in PPP loans. Additionally, First National Bank originated $28,208 in PPP loans in 2020. These increases in loans were partially offset by a few large payoffs of commercial loans and a lower volume of consumer and residential loan originations made in 2020.
Total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were $802,184, up 76.27% from $455,085 as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher levels of deposits. Total deposits increased $331,053, or 73.52%, to $781,336 as of December 31, 2020 from $450,283 at December 31, 2019. Approximately $211,000 of the deposit growth resulted from new accounts acquired through the merger with Virginia Bank. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $139,608, or 126.43%, and represented 32.03% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020, compared to 24.52% as of December 31, 2019. Savings and NOW accounts increased $166,307, or 67.90%, and represented 52.63% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020, compared to 54.40% as of December 31, 2019. Time deposits increased $25,138 or 26.48% and represented 15.37% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020, compared to 21.08% as of December 31, 2019. Pinnacle had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Total stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020 was $58,330, including $44,509 in retained earnings. At December 31, 2019, stockholders’ equity totaled $45,445, including $42,404 in retained earnings. The increase in stockholders’ equity resulted largely from $11,447 in in common stock issued in conjunctions with the merger with Virginia Bank and by net income of $3,062 less dividends paid to shareholders of $957. Dividends paid to shareholders were $0.56 per share paid in 2020 as compared to $0.545 per share paid in 2019.
Pinnacle had net income of $3,062 in 2020, compared to net income of $4,396 in 2019, a decrease of 30.35%, which was mainly driven by higher noninterest expense. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to $2,889 in expenses associated with Pinnacle’s merger with Virginia Bank as well as higher salaries and employee benefits related to strategic growth initiatives to include the Bank’s Downtown Lynchburg Branch and its Charlottesville Loan Production Office. The increase in noninterest expense was partially offset by an increase in noninterest income which was primarily due to a $2,694 bargain purchase gain related to the merger with Virginia Bank.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Pinnacle produced $18,269 in net interest income, which represents a $593, or 3.35%, increase as compared to the $17,676 generated in 2019. Interest income increased $549, or 2.71%, due to higher loan volume in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of the merger with Virginia Bank, while interest expense decreased $43,000, or 1.68%, due mainly to a decrease in the cost of deposits caused by lower interest rates.
Pinnacle’s provision for loan losses was $252 for 2020 representing an $89, or 54.60%, increase as compared to $163 for 2019. Pinnacle’s provision for loan losses for 2020 included the impact of qualitative adjustments to Pinnacle’s allowance for loan losses required due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Noninterest income increased $4,049, or 87.58%, in 2020 to $8,672 from $4,623 in 2019. This improvement was mainly driven by the $2,694 bargain purchase gain related to the merger with Virginia Bank recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $386 increase in fees generated from sales of mortgage loans. Revenue from Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) increased $253 in 2020. Pinnacle also experienced a $249 increase in loan fees primarily associated with the origination of $28,208 in PPP loans. Other increases in net income included a $148 increase in debit card interchange income, a $90 increase in income derived from the Bank’s investment in Bankers Insurance, LLC, and a $90 increase in commissions on sales of investments and insurance.
Noninterest expense increased $5,741, or 34.23%, in 2020 to $22,513 from $16,772 in 2019. The increase is primarily attributed to $2,889 in merger expenses primarily consisting of legal, accounting, investment banking and contract termination fees. Pinnacle also experienced a $1,167 increase in salaries and benefits and a $496,000 increase in furniture, equipment and occupancy expenses due to growth of Pinnacle during 2020.
Profitability as measured by Pinnacle’s return on average assets (“ROA”) was 0.52% in 2020, which is a 40 basis points decrease from the 0.92% produced in 2019. Correspondingly, return on average equity (“ROE”) also decreased in 2020 to 6.36%, compared to 9.86% for the prior year.
Results of Operations, 2020
Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the principal source of earnings for Pinnacle. Net interest income is the amount by which interest and fees generated from loans, securities and other interest-bearing assets exceed the interest expense associated with funding those assets. Changes in the amounts and mix of interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. Changes in the interest rate environment and Pinnacle’s cost of funds also effect net interest income.
The net interest spread decreased to 3.15% in 2020 from 3.82% in 2019. Net interest income was $18,269 in 2020, compared to $17,676 in 2019. In 2020, Pinnacle’s asset yields decreased greater than its deposit rates causing Pinnacle’s interest rate spread to decrease. Pinnacle’s yield on interest-earning assets in 2020 was 78 basis points lower than in 2019 due to higher yielding assets being replaced by lower yielding assets in the second half of 2019 and in 2020 and repricing of existing assets in the lower interest rate environment. Pinnacle’s cost of funds rate on interest-bearing liabilities in 2020 was 11 basis points lower compared to 2019.
Pinnacle’s net interest margin also decreased to 3.34% in 2020 from 4.00% in 2019. Pinnacle’s lower net interest margin in 2020 was due to lower yields from new loans and investments as a result of a lower interest rate environment in the second half of 2019 and in 2020. Pinnacle attempts to conserve net interest margin by product pricing strategies, such as attracting deposits with longer maturities when rates are relatively low and attracting deposits with shorter maturities when rates are relatively high, all depending on our funding needs. While there is no guarantee of how rates may change in 2021, Pinnacle will price products that are competitive in the market, allow for growth and strive to maintain the net interest margin as much as possible. Pinnacle also continues to seek new sources of noninterest income to combat the effects of volatility in the interest rate environment.
The following table presents the major categories of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and stockholders’ equity with corresponding average balances, related interest income or interest expense and resulting yield and rates for the periods indicated.
ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME
(1)
Averages are daily averages.
(2)
Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans outstanding.
(3)
Tax-exempt income from investment securities is presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a 21% U.S. Federal tax rate for 2020 and 2019 and 34% for 2018.
(4)
The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average total interest-earning assets.
(5)
The net interest spread is calculated by subtracting the interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities from the interest rate earned on interest-earning assets.
As discussed above, Pinnacle’s net interest income is affected by the change in the amounts and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change,” as well as by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as “rate change.” The following table presents, for the periods indicated, a summary of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the amounts of change attributable to variations in volumes and rates. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses is based upon Pinnacle’s evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio, total outstanding and committed loans, Pinnacle’s previous loan loss experience and current and anticipated economic conditions. The amount of the provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings. Actual loan losses are charges against the allowance for loan losses.
Pinnacle’s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed by management to be adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio. No assurance can be given that unforeseen adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased provisions in the future, or that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate for actual losses. Additionally, regulatory examiners may require Pinnacle to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.
The provisions for loan losses for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $252 and $163, respectively. The provision for loan losses increased $89 during 2020 when compared to 2019 due to a change in qualitative factors adjusted for the COVID-19 Pandemic and deferred loans as the economy deteriorated in 2020. Pinnacle saw a decrease in its nonperforming loans to total loans from 0.29% on December 31, 2019 to 0.17% on December 31, 2020. Nonperforming loans were $1,135 as of December 31, 2019 and $950 as of December 31, 2020. Pinnacle expects credit quality in its loan portfolio to moderately decrease in 2021 due to the ongoing Pandemic and continues to work to minimize its losses from nonaccrual and past due loans. See “Allowance for Loan Losses” for further discussion.
Noninterest Income. Total noninterest income for 2020 increased $4,049, or 87.58%, to $8,672 from $4,623 in 2019. This improvement was mainly driven by the $2,694 bargain purchase gain related to the merger and a $386 increase in fees generated from sales of mortgage loans. Revenue from Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) increased $253 in 2020. Pinnacle also experienced a $249 increase in loan fees primarily associated with the origination of $28,208 in PPP loans. Other increases in net income included a $148 increase in debit card interchange income, a $90 increase in income derived from the Bank’s investment in Bankers Insurance, LLC, and a $90 increase in commissions on sales of investments and insurance
Noninterest Expense. Total noninterest expense for 2020 increased $5,741, or 34.23%, to $22,513 from $16,772 in 2019. The increase is primarily attributed to $2,889 in merger expenses primarily consisting of legal, accounting, investment banking and contract termination fees. Pinnacle also experienced a $1,167 increase in salaries and benefits and a $496,000 increase in furniture, equipment and occupancy expenses due to growth of Pinnacle during 2020.
Income Tax Expense. Income taxes on 2020 earnings amounted to $1,114, resulting in an effective tax rate of 26.67%, compared to $968, and an effective tax rate of 18.05% in 2019. The income tax rate increased in 2020 due mainly to capitalized merger transaction costs from the merger with Virginia Bank.
Liquidity. Effective asset/liability management includes maintaining adequate liquidity and minimizing the impact of future interest rate changes on net interest income. The responsibility for monitoring Pinnacle’s liquidity and the sensitivity of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities lies with the Investment Committee of First National Bank, which meets at least quarterly to review liquidity and the adequacy of funding sources.
Liquidity measures the ability of Pinnacle to meet its maturing obligations and existing commitments, to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels, to fund its operations, and to provide for customers’ credit needs. Liquidity represents an institution’s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds from alternative funding sources. Pinnacle’s liquidity is provided by cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, investments available-for-sale, managing investment maturities, interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions and loan repayments.
Pinnacle’s ratio of liquid assets to deposits and short-term borrowings was 34.12% as of December 31, 2020 as compared to 15.77% as of December 31, 2019. Pinnacle sells excess funds as overnight federal funds sold to provide an immediate source of liquidity. Federal funds sold at December 31, 2020 were $479 as most funds were kept in Pinnacle’s Federal Reserve account, which is interest-bearing. Cash and due from banks of $210,814, which includes funds in Pinnacle’s Federal Reserve account, as of December 31, 2020 was $177,911 higher when compared to December 31, 2019. Pinnacle expects to deploy some of this cash into securities and loans in 2021.
The level of deposits may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal business cycles of depository customers. Levels of deposits are also affected by convenience of branch locations and ATMs to the customer, the rates offered on interest-bearing deposits and the attractiveness of noninterest-bearing deposit offerings compared with the competition. Some main factors that have increased Pinnacle’s 2020 deposit levels include PPP loan proceeds, government stimulus checks and our customers’ “flight to safety” strategy during the ongoing pandemic. Similarly, the level of demand for loans may vary significantly and at any given time may increase or decrease substantially. However, unlike the level of deposits, management has more direct control over lending activities and maintains the level of those activities according to the amounts of available funds. Loan demand may be affected by the overall health of the local economy, loan rates compared with the competition and other loan features offered by Pinnacle.
As a result of Pinnacle’s management of liquid assets and its ability to generate liquidity through alternative funding sources, management believes that Pinnacle maintains overall liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and to meet customers’ credit needs. Additional sources of liquidity available to Pinnacle include its capacity to borrow funds through correspondent banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank. The total amount available for borrowing to Pinnacle for liquidity purposes was $143,080 on December 31, 2020 and $135,622 on December 31, 2019.
Pinnacle obtains sources of funds through growth in deposits, scheduled payments and prepayments from the loan and investment portfolios and retained earnings growth, and may purchase or borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank or through the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Pinnacle also has sources of liquidity through two correspondent banking relationships. Pinnacle uses its funds to fund loan and investment growth. Excess funds are sold daily to other institutions. Pinnacle also has a $5,000 holding company line of credit with a correspondent bank for bank capital purposes with no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Pinnacle completed a private placement of $8,000 in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) in the third quarter of 2020. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital under bank regulatory guidelines in the future, and the proceeds from the sale of the Notes were utilized to pay a portion of the cash consideration paid by Pinnacle in connection with its merger with Virginia Bank on October 30, 2020, and to provide optionality for various growth opportunities and for general corporate purposes. The Notes bear interest at 5.25% per annum, beginning September 18, 2020 to, but excluding September 30, 2025, payable quarterly in arrears. From September 30, 2025 to, but excluding, September 30, 2030, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 513 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. Beginning on September 30, 2025 through maturity, the Notes may be redeemed, at Pinnacle’s option and subject to any required regulatory approval, on any scheduled interest payment date. The Notes will mature on September 30, 2030.
Pinnacle also completed a $2,000 fixed-to-floating rate promissory note due 2030 (the “Promissory Note”) in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Promissory Note bears interest at 5.25% per annum, beginning December 18, 2020 to, but excluding December 31, 2025, payable quarterly in arrears. From December 31, 2025 to, but excluding December 31, 2030, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 515 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. The Promissory Note will mature on December 31, 2030.
Interest Rates
While no single measure can completely identify the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, one gauge of interest rate sensitivity is to measure, over a variety of time periods, the differences in the amounts of Pinnacle’s rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. These differences or “gaps” provide an indication of the extent to which net interest income may be affected by future changes in interest rates. A “positive gap” exists when rate-sensitive assets exceed rate-sensitive liabilities and indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given period. This mismatch may enhance earnings in a rising interest rate environment and may inhibit earnings in a declining interest rate environment. Conversely, when rate-sensitive liabilities exceed rate-sensitive assets, referred to as a “negative gap,” it indicates that a greater volume of liabilities than assets will reprice during the period. In this case, a rising interest rate environment may inhibit earnings and a declining interest rate environment may enhance earnings.
The cumulative three-year gap as of December 31, 2020 was $143,963, representing 16.72% of total assets, which was within First National Bank’s interest rate risk parameters.
The following table illustrates Pinnacle’s interest rate sensitivity gap position at December 31, 2020.
REPRICING GAP POSITION
As of December 31, 2020, Pinnacle was asset-sensitive in all periods up to 15 years. The foregoing table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on Pinnacle’s net interest yield, because the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competition and other pressures. As a result, various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may reprice at different times and at different rate levels. Management attempts to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates in several ways, one of which is to manage its interest rate-sensitivity gap. In addition to managing its asset/liability position, Pinnacle has taken steps to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates by generating noninterest income through service charges, and offering products that are not interest rate-sensitive.
Effects of Inflation
The effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different from other industries as Pinnacle’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Interest rates are significantly impacted by inflation, but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes is directly related to price level indices. Impacts of inflation on interest rates, loan demand and deposits are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
Investment Portfolio
Pinnacle’s investment portfolio is used primarily for investment income and secondarily for liquidity purposes. Pinnacle invests funds not used for capital expenditures or lending purposes in securities of the U.S. Government and its agencies, mortgage-backed securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds, and certificates of deposit. Obligations of the U.S. Government and its agencies include treasury notes and callable or noncallable agency bonds. The mortgage-backed securities include mortgage-backed security pools that are diverse as to interest rates. Pinnacle has not invested in derivatives.
Investment securities as of December 31, 2020 totaled $46,741, an increase of $1,783, or 3.97%, from $44,958 as of December 31, 2019. Held-to-maturity investment securities decreased to $500 as of December 31, 2020 from $1,764 as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,264, or 71.66%. Available-for-sale investments increased to $46,241 as of December 31, 2020 from $43,194 as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $3,047, or 7.05%.
The following table presents the composition of Pinnacle’s investment portfolios as of the dates indicated.

Obligations of states and political subdivisions include yields of tax-exempt securities presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a U.S. federal income tax rate of 21%.
Tax-exempt income from investment securities is presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% for 2020 and 2019.
Loan Portfolio
Typically, Pinnacle maintains a ratio of loans to deposits of between 70% and 90%. The loan portfolio primarily consists of commercial, real estate (including real estate term loans, construction loans and other loans secured by real estate), and loans to individuals for household, family and other consumer expenditures. However, Pinnacle adjusts its mix of lending and the terms of its loan programs according to market conditions and other factors. Pinnacle’s loans are typically made to businesses and individuals located within Pinnacle’s market area, most of whom have account relationships with First National Bank. There is no concentration of loans exceeding 10% of total loans that is not disclosed in the categories presented below. Pinnacle has not made any loans to any foreign entities including governments, banks, businesses or individuals. Commercial and construction loans in Pinnacle’s portfolio are primarily variable rate loans and have little interest rate risk.
Pinnacle’s net loans were $560,079 as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $170,230, or 43.67%, from $389,849 as of December 31, 2019. Loans increased primarily due to the addition of approximately $154,000 in loans acquired in the merger, which included $13,503 in Paycheck Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans. Additionally, First National Bank originated $28,208 in PPP loans in 2020. These increases in loans were partially offset by a few large payoffs of commercial loans and a lower volume of consumer and residential loan originations made in 2020. Pinnacle’s ratio of net loans to total deposits was 71.68% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 86.58% as of December 31, 2019.
Pinnacle had no option adjustable rate mortgages, subprime loans or loans with teaser rates and similar products as of December 31, 2020. Junior lien mortgages totaled $36,144 as of December 31, 2020 with a specific allowance for loan loss calculation of $184. Pinnacle had interest only loans totaling $85,299 as of December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage loans with a loan to collateral value ratio exceeding 100% were $2,186 as of December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the composition of Pinnacle’s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans accounted for 18.65% of Pinnacle’s gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 compared to 15.64% as of December 31, 2019. Such loans are generally made to provide operating lines of credit, to finance the purchase of inventory or equipment, and for other business purposes. Commercial loans are primarily made at rates that adjust with changes in the prevailing prime interest rate, are generally made for a maximum term of five years (unless they are term loans), and generally require interest payments to be made monthly. The creditworthiness of these borrowers is reviewed, analyzed and evaluated on a periodic basis. Most commercial loans are collateralized with business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Even with substantial collateralization such as all of the assets of the business and personal guarantees, commercial lending involves considerable risk of loss in the event of a business downturn or failure of the business.
Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans accounted for 60.16% of Pinnacle’s gross loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 compared to 59.12% as of December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, 55.64% of the real estate loans were secured by 1-4 family residential properties. Of these 1-4 family residential property loans, 4.29% were construction loans, 17.45% were home equity lines of credit, 76.58% were closed end loans secured by a first deed of trust and 1.68% were closed end loans secured by a second deed of trust.
As of December 31, 2020, 44.36% of the real estate loans were secured by commercial real estate. Of the total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2020, 8.21% were acquisition and development loans, 52.27% were secured by owner occupied commercial real estate and 39.52% were secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate, typically 1st and 2nd deeds of trust.
Real estate lending involves risk elements when, among other things, there is lack of timely payment and/or a decline in the value of the collateral. Both commercial and residential real estate values in Pinnacle’s market improved slightly in 2020. Pinnacle continuously monitors the local real estate market for signs of weakness that could decrease collateral values.
Installment Loans. Installment loans are represented by loans to individuals for household, family and other consumer expenditures with typical collateral such as automobile titles. Installment loans accounted for 21.19% of Pinnacle’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 compared to 25.24% as of December 31, 2019.
Loan Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity. The following table presents loan portfolio information related to maturity distribution of commercial and industrial loans and real estate construction loans based on scheduled repayments at December 31, 2020.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings. Pinnacle had eight restructured loans totaling $1,714 at December 31, 2020 and two restructured loans totaling $191 at December 31, 2019.
Pinnacle offers a variety of modifications to borrowers. The modification categories offered can generally be described in the following categories.
•
Rate Modification is a modification in which the interest rate is changed.
•
Term Modification is a modification in which the maturity date, timing of payments or frequency of payments is changed.
•
Interest Only Modification is a modification in which the loan is converted to interest only payments for a period of time.
•
Payment Modification is a modification in which the dollar amount of the payment is changed, other than an interest only modification described above.
•
Combination Modification is any other type of modification, including the use of multiple categories above.
There were no available commitments for troubled debt restructurings outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Deferred Loans. The following table presents the composition of Pinnacle’s deferred loan portfolio as of the date indicated (dollars in thousands).
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the OCC issued guidance that stated that deferrals granted as the result of the pandemic, up to 180 days, would not have to be categorized as troubled debt restructures. Pinnacle took a more conservative approach and initially worked with borrowers on a 90 day deferral basis. Internally, Pinnacle agreed that it may consider an additional 90 days based on the depth and duration of the pandemic and the overall apparent impact to the borrower. All of the deferred loans are still accruing and are rated according to their last full underwriting. Any deferral beyond the initial 90 days is subject to additional analysis. As of December 31, 2020, discussions with Pinnacle’s borrowers do not indicate any issues that would warrant any further downgrades of the deferred credits. Deferred credits represent less than 1% of Pinnacle’s total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Within Pinnacle’s allowance for loan losses, $0 has been allocated to the deferred loan portfolio.
Nonperforming Assets. Loans on nonaccrual status amounted to $891 as of December 31, 2020 and $1,135 on December 31, 2019. Interest income that would have been earned on nonaccrual loans if they had been current in accordance with their original terms and the recorded interest that was included in income on these loans was not significant for 2020 or 2019. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Two foreclosed properties were on hand totaling $519 as of December 31, 2020 compared to five properties totaling $666 as of December 31, 2019.
Pinnacle expects nonperforming assets to increase slightly in 2021 as the local economy is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Pinnacle will continue to monitor the economy and take steps necessary to mitigate losses in its loan portfolio, such as increased early monitoring of its portfolio to identify “problem” credits and continued counseling of customers to discuss options available to them. The following table presents information with respect to Pinnacle’s nonperforming assets and nonaccruing loans 90 days or more past due by type as of the dates indicated.
NONPERFORMING ASSETS
Nonperforming assets totaled $1,469, or 0.17%, of total assets as of December 31, 2020 and $1,801, or 0.36%, of total assets as of December 31, 2019. The following table presents the balance of accruing loans 90 days or more past due by type as of the dates indicated.
ACCRUING LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE
PAST DUE BY TYPE
Allowance for Loan Losses. Pinnacle maintains an allowance for loan losses which it considers adequate to cover the risk of losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on management’s ongoing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio, total outstanding and committed loans, previous charges against the allowance and current and anticipated economic conditions. The allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy, which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance
Pinnacle’s management believes that as of December 31, 2020, the allowance was adequate. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses totaled $3,478, or 0.62%, of total loans, net of unearned income and fees, compared to $3,472, or 0.88%, of total loans, net of unearned income and fees, as of December 31, 2019. The net credit mark on loans acquired from the merger with Virginia Bank as of December 31, 2020 was $2,952. The allowance for loan loss plus the net credit mark was $6,430 or 1.14%, of Pinnacle’s total loans as of December 31, 2020. The provision for loan losses for 2020 and 2019 was $252 and $163, respectively. Net charge-offs for Pinnacle were $237 for 2020 as compared to net charge-offs of $57 in 2019. The ratio of net loan charge-offs during the period to average loans outstanding for the period was less than 0.01% for 2020.
Management evaluates the reasonableness of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis and adjusts the provision as deemed necessary in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as well as industry standards. Management uses historical loss data by loan type as well as current economic factors in its calculation of allowance for loan loss. Management also uses qualitative factors such as changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in national and local economies, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, changes in experience of lenders and the loan department, changes in volume and severity of past due and classified loans, changes in quality of First National Bank’s loan review system, the existence and effect of concentrations of credit and external factors such as competition and regulation in its allowance for loan loss calculation. Each qualitative factor is evaluated and applied to each type of loan in Pinnacle’s portfolio and a percentage of each loan is reserved as allowance. A percentage of each loan is also reserved according to the loan type’s historical loss data. Larger percentages of allowance are taken as the risk for a loan is determined to be greater.
The following table presents charged off loans, provisions for loan losses, recoveries on loans previously charged off, allowance adjustments and the amount of the allowance for the years indicated.
ANALYSIS OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
The primary risk elements considered by management with respect to each installment and conventional real estate loan are lack of timely payment and the value of the collateral. The primary risk elements with respect to real estate construction loans are fluctuations in real estate values in Pinnacle’s market areas, inaccurate estimates of construction costs, fluctuations in interest rates, the availability of conventional financing, the demand for housing in Pinnacle’s market area and general economic conditions. The primary risk elements with respect to commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower, general economic conditions in Pinnacle’s market area, the sufficiency of collateral, the timeliness of payment and, with respect to adjustable rate loans, interest rate fluctuations. Management has a policy of requesting and reviewing annual financial statements from its commercial loan customers and periodically reviews the existence of collateral and its value at least annually. Management also has a reporting system that monitors all past due loans and has adopted policies to pursue its creditor’s rights in order to preserve Pinnacle’s position. Management also recognizes the real estate values may decline in Pinnacle’s markets and is diligently monitoring appraisal values at least annually.
Loans are charged against the allowance when, in management’s opinion, they are deemed uncollectible, although Pinnacle continues to aggressively pursue collection. Pinnacle considers a number of factors to determine the need for and timing of charge-offs including the following: whenever any commercial loan becomes past due for 120 days for any scheduled principal or interest payment and collection is considered uncollectible; whenever foreclosure on real estate collateral or liquidation of other collateral does not result in full payment of the obligation and the deficiency or some portion thereof is deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible portion is charged-off; whenever any installment loan becomes past due for 120 days and collection is considered unlikely; whenever any repossessed vehicle remains unsold for 60 days after repossession; whenever a bankruptcy notice is received on any installment loan and review of the facts results in an assessment that all or most of the balance will not be collected, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual status; whenever a bankruptcy notice is received on a small, unsecured, revolving installment account; and whenever any other small, unsecured, revolving installment account becomes past due for 180 days.
Although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses as they arise, there can be no assurance that (i) Pinnacle will not sustain losses in any given period which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses, (ii) Pinnacle’s level of nonperforming loans will not increase, (iii) Pinnacle will not be required to make significant additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses, or (iv) the level of net charge-offs will not increase and possibly exceed applicable reserves.
The following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of the dates indicated. Notwithstanding these allocations, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge-offs in any category of loans.
While consumer related charge-offs represent many of the charge-offs over the last three years, they are of a relatively low dollar amount on an individual loan basis. Commercial and real estate loans on the other hand, though relatively few in terms of the number of charge-offs over the past three years, have the potential to greatly impact the allowance if a particular loan defaults. Bank management uses the principles of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) topic Receivables, when determining the allocation of allowance for loan losses between loan categories. The determination of a loan category’s allowance is based on the probability of a loan’s default and the probability of loss in the event of a default.
Credit Risk Management
The risk of nonpayment of loans is an inherent aspect of commercial banking. The degree of perceived risk is taken into account in establishing the structure of, and interest rates and security for, specific loans and various types of loans. Pinnacle strives to minimize its credit risk exposure by its credit underwriting standards and loan policies and procedures. Management continually evaluates the credit risks of its loans and believes it has provided adequately for the credit risks associated with these loans. Pinnacle has implemented and expects to continue to implement and update new policies and procedures to maintain its credit risk management systems.
Bank Premises and Equipment
Bank premises and equipment increased 45.82% in 2020 due mainly to assets acquired from Virginia Bank and the purchase of a new branch location that is due to open in 2021. Pinnacle was leasing the Downtown Lynchburg, Amherst and Charlottesville facilities and leasing land for the Riverside Branch as of December 31, 2020.
Deposits
The levels of demand deposits (including retail accounts) are influenced by such factors as customer service, service charges and the availability of banking services. No assurance can be given that Pinnacle will be able to maintain its current level of demand deposits. Competition from other banks, credit unions and thrift institutions as well as money market funds, some of which offer interest rates substantially higher than Pinnacle, makes it difficult for Pinnacle to maintain the current level of demand deposits. Management continually works to implement pricing and marketing strategies designed to control the cost of interest-bearing deposits and to maintain a stable deposit mix.
Average deposits were $531,003 for 2020, an increase of $98,901 or 22.89% from $432,102 of average deposits for 2019. As of December 31, 2020, total deposits were $781,336 representing an increase of $331,053, or 73.52%, from $450,283 in total deposits as of December 31, 2019. Approximately $212,000 of the deposit growth in 2020 resulted from new accounts acquired through the merger with Virginia Bank.
For 2020, average demand deposits were $142,659, or 26.87%, of average deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits were $388,354 for 2020, compared to the $336,472 in average interest-bearing deposits for 2019.

RETURN ON EQUITY AND ASSETS
Capital Resources
Total stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020 was $58,330, including $43,509 in retained earnings. As of December 31, 2019, stockholders’ equity totaled $45,445, including $42,404 in retained earnings. The increase in stockholders’ equity resulted mainly from a $11,447 increase in common stock and surplus due to the merger with Virginia Bank and a $2,105 increase in retained earnings partially offset by an $847 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. Dividends paid to shareholders were $0.56 per share paid in 2020 as compared to the $0.545 per share paid in 2019.
In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved and published the final Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. CET1 capital for Pinnacle and First National Bank consists of common stock, related paid in capital, and retained earnings. In connection with the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules, we elected to opt out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in CET1. CET1 for Pinnacle and First National Bank is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities and subject to transition provisions.
Basel III limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if First National Bank does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.50% of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer was first applied on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk weighted assets, increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.50% on January 1, 2019. Basel III was fully phased in on January 1, 2019 and now requires (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 capital to risk weighted assets of at least 4.50%, plus a 2.50% capital conservation buffer, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets of at least 6.00%, plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least 8.00%, plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.00%.
Pinnacle exceeds all regulatory capital requirements that would apply under Basel III at December 31, 2020 if Pinnacle was not subject to the Federal Reserve’s small bank holding company policy statement. Pinnacle’s CET1 and Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio was 10.63% and 11.48% as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Total Risk-based Capital Ratio was 11.27% and 12.36% as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Pinnacle’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 8.01% and 9.67% as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. For comparison, Pinnacle’s CET1 and Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio was 11.14% at December 31, 2018. The Total Risk-based Capital Ratio was 12.04% and Pinnacle’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 9.15% as of December 31, 2018. See Note 9 “Dividend Restrictions and Capital Requirements” to Pinnacle’s condensed consolidated financial statements, and Note 12 “Dividend Restrictions and Capital Requirements” to Pinnacle’s audited consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding the Federal Reserve’s small bank holding company policy statement and the regulatory capital of the Bank..
Pinnacle’s financial position as of December 31, 2020 reflects liquidity and capital levels management believes to be currently adequate to support anticipated funding needs and budgeted growth of Pinnacle. Capital ratios are in excess of required regulatory minimums for a “well-capitalized” institution. The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, and changing competitive conditions and economic forces. The adequacy of Pinnacle’s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Pinnacle did not use any interest rate ceiling, floor or interest rate swap financial derivatives during 2020. However, Pinnacle, as a normal business practice in 2020, has mortgage rate lock commitments that are subsequently funded by Pinnacle. Pinnacle then sells the mortgage loan to a secondary market bank that had underwritten the mortgage loan before Pinnacle funded the loan. The secondary market bank pays a fee that was agreed upon on the lock commitment date to Pinnacle and buys the loan within fifteen days of the initial funding by Pinnacle. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Pinnacle had $3,910 and $2,590, respectively, in lock commitments that had not yet been funded with agreed upon fees of $103 and $51, respectively, to be paid to Pinnacle after the loan was purchased by the secondary market bank. Also, Pinnacle has off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a material effect on the results of operations in the future.
Also, Pinnacle has off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a material effect on the results of operations in the future. Pinnacle, in the normal course of business, may at times be a party to financial instruments such as standby letters of credit. Standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2020 equaled $7,960 compared with $5,074 as of December 31, 2019. Other commitments include commitments to lend money. Not all of these commitments will be acted upon; therefore, the cash requirements will likely be significantly less than the commitments themselves. As of December 31, 2020, Pinnacle had unused loan commitments of $109,414 including $36,281 in unused commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year compared with $79,001 including $36,140 in unused commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Pinnacle had unused loan commitments of $79,001 including $36,140 in unused commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year compared with $72,899 including $28,003 in unused commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year as of December 31, 2018. See Note 9 to Pinnacle’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
The reporting policies of Pinnacle are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Pinnacle’s single most critical accounting policy relates to Pinnacle’s allowance for loan losses, which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of Pinnacle’s borrowers to make required loan payments. If the financial condition of Pinnacle’s borrowers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, Pinnacle’s estimates would be updated, and additional provisions for loan losses may be required. Further discussion of the estimates used in determining the allowance for loan losses is contained in the discussion on “Allowance for Loan Losses” and “Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses” in Note 1 to Pinnacle’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued pronouncements which are not yet effective and the impact, if any, on our financial statements, see Note 1(h), “Current Accounting Developments” of the notes to Pinnacle’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are included in Part II,
