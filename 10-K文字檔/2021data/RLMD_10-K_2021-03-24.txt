Our Corporate History and Background
Relmada Therapeutics is a late-stage, publicly traded biotechnology company developing (New Chemical Entities) NCEs to address areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of CNS diseases - primarily depression. The Company’s lead product Esmethadone, is an NCE being developed as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of depression and other potential indications. We have previously completed Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies and on October 15, 2019 we reported top-line data from study REL-1017-202, a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two doses of REL-1017, 25 mg once a day and 50 mg once a day, as an adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD. On Dec. 7, the Company announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the first Phase 3 clinical trial (RELIANCE I) of REL-1017, as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).
Key points of the REL-017 Phase 3 program agreed upon in discussions with FDA include:
● The Phase 3 program will consist of two sister, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Each trial will be conducted in 55 clinical sites in the United States and will include approximately 400 MDD patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressants in their current depression episode. Patients will add either a 25 mg oral dose of REL-1017 once per day or placebo to their ongoing antidepressant treatment.
● The primary endpoint to be evaluated will be the change from baseline on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at day-28 for REL-1017 compared to placebo. Success on this endpoint with the collection of sufficient safety data would support the use of REL-1017 for chronic treatment, if approved.
● The change from baseline and the 7-day MADRS score will serve as a key secondary endpoint and will provide data on the rapid onset of treatment effect; statistically significant separation between REL-1017 and the control group was achieved by day 4 in the Phase 2 proof-of-principle trial completed in 2019.
● The Company expects to initiate the second Phase 3 trial, RELIANCE II, in the first half of 2021. Patients who complete RELIANCE I and RELIANCE II will be eligible to rollover into the long-term, open-label study, which is also expected to include subjects who had not previously participated in a REL-1017 clinical trial.
The Company changed its fiscal year end to December 31 from June 30. This transition report was for the six-month transition period of July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. The information for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented for comparative purposes only and is unaudited.
We have not generated revenues and do not anticipate generating revenues for the foreseeable future. We had a net loss of approximately $59,456,400, $15,005,200, $8,196,500, and $17,318,100 for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 (unaudited), six months ended December 31, 2019, and for the year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $179,315,300.

Income Taxes
The Company did not provide for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, since there was a loss and a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets.
Net Loss
The Company recorded a net loss of approximately $59,456,400 and $15,005,200 or $3.81 and $1.62 per common share, basic and diluted, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, based on the factors described above.

As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred negative operating cash flows of $27,808,801 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and has an accumulated deficit of $179,315,303 from inception through December 31, 2020.
Relmada has funded its past operations through equity raises and most recently in the year ended December 31, 2020, Relmada raised net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $19,791,644 and $8,056,416 through the exercise of warrants, and $735,514 through the exercise of options.
Management believes that due to the recent equity raises completed and exercises of outstanding warrants and the resulting cash position on its balance sheet, it has obtained sufficient funding to continue ongoing operations for at least 12 months from the filing of this annual report. Since December 31, 2020 and to date, the Company has received approximately $1,909,200 in warrant and option exercises, which resulted in the Company having approximately $105.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at March 15, 2021. Based on its budgeted cash flow requirements, the Company believes these funds are sufficient to fund its ongoing operations for at least 12 months after the filing of this annual report. The Company expects that the cash burn rate for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, will range between $75 and $100 million.

Effects of Inflation
Our assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash and cash equivalents. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources.
Contractual Obligations
The following tables sets forth our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter:
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Seasonality
We do not have a seasonal business cycle.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates are incurred costs of clinical studies, stock-based compensation expense, valuation of derivative financial liabilities, and income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets.
Research and Development
Research and development costs primarily consist of research contracts for the advancement of product development, salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, and consultants. The Company expenses all research and development costs in the period incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award - the requisite service period. The grant-date fair value of employee share options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. Compensation expense for warrants granted to non-employees is determined by the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured, and is recognized over the service period. The expense is subsequently adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period until such warrants vest, and the fair value of such instruments, as adjusted, is expensed over the related vesting period. Adjustments to fair value at each reporting date may result in income or expense, depending upon the estimate of fair value and the amount of expense recorded prior to the adjustment. The Company reviews its agreements and the future performance obligation with respect to the unvested warrants for its vendors or consultants. When appropriate, the Company will expense the unvested warrants at the time when management deems the service obligation for future services has ceased.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income or expense in the period that the change is effective. Tax benefits are recognized when it is probable that the deduction will be sustained. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will either expire before the Company is able to realize the benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and June 30, 2019, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to the full extent of our net deferred tax assets since the likelihood of realization of the benefit does not meet the more likely than not threshold.
