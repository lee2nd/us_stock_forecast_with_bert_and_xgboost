The following combined discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. When discussing CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated financial information, it includes the results of Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such. Unless the context indicates otherwise, specific references to Houston Electric and CERC also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
OVERVIEW
Background
CenterPoint Energy, Inc. is a public utility holding company and owns interests in Enable. CenterPoint Energy’s operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution facilities, and provide energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services. For a detailed description of CenterPoint Energy’s operating subsidiaries and discontinued operations, please read Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Houston Electric is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy that provides electric transmission service to transmission service customers in the ERCOT region and distribution service to REPs serving the Texas Gulf Coast area that includes the city of Houston.
CERC Corp. is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy that owns and operates natural gas distribution facilities in six states, with operating subsidiaries that own and operate permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, and provide temporary delivery of LNG and CNG throughout the contiguous 48 states.
Reportable Segments
In this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our reportable segments, which are listed below. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject, among other factors.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s CODM requested that the financial information for the electric businesses be presented on an aggregated basis for review, resulting in one Electric reportable segment, comprised of Houston Electric and Indiana Electric. Also, the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment was renamed Natural Gas. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s CODM requested that the CERC corporate functions be included within the financial results of CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas reportable segment for review purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2020, CERC’s CODM requested that the CERC corporate functions be included within the financial results of CERC’s Natural Gas reportable segment for review purposes. As a result of this change, and following the divestiture of the Energy Services Disposal Group, CERC now consists of a single reportable segment. Houston Electric also consists of a single reportable segment.
As of December 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s reportable segments were Electric, Natural Gas and Midstream Investments.
•The Electric reportable segment includes electric transmission and distribution services in Houston Electric’s transmission and distribution service territory that are subject to rate regulation and impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility and energy delivery services to electric customers and electric generation assets to serve its electric customers and optimize those assets in the
wholesale power market in Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution service territory. For further information about the Electric reportable segment, see “Business - Our Business - Electric” in Item 1 of Part I of this report.
•The Natural Gas reportable segment includes natural gas distribution services that are subject to rate regulation in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s service territories, as well as home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota and home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Texas and Louisiana through a third party. For further information about the Natural Gas reportable segment, see “Business - Our Business - Natural Gas” in Item 1 of Part I of this report.
•The Midstream Investments reportable segment includes CenterPoint Energy’s equity investment in Enable and is dependent upon the results of Enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that Enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems and other factors as discussed below under “- Factors Influencing Midstream Investments.” On February 16, 2021, Enable entered into the Enable Merger Agreement. At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Enable Merger Agreement, if and when it occurs, Energy Transfer will acquire all of Enable’s outstanding equity interests, including all Enable common units and Enable Series A Preferred Units held by CenterPoint Energy, and in return CenterPoint Energy will receive Energy Transfer common units and Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units. For further information about the Midstream Investments reportable segment, see “Business - Our Business - Midstream Investments” in Item 1 of Part I of this report. For further information on the Enable Merger, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations, energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services and other corporate support operations.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We expect our and Enable’s businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
Factors Influencing Our Businesses and Industry Trends
We are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries. On February 1, 2019, we acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash. Through its subsidiaries, Vectren’s operations consist of utility and non-utility businesses. The utility operations include three public utilities, Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO, which, in the aggregate, provide natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly 67% of Indiana and about 20% of Ohio and electric transmission and distribution services to southwestern Indiana, including power generating and wholesale power operations. In total, these utility operations supply natural gas and electricity to over one million customers in Indiana and Ohio. The non-utility operations included ESG and Infrastructure Services. ESG provides energy services through performance-based energy contracting operations and sustainable infrastructure services, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects. ESG assists schools, hospitals, governmental facilities and other private institutions with reducing energy and maintenance costs by upgrading their facilities with energy-efficient equipment. ESG operates throughout the United States. Infrastructure Services, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provided underground pipeline and repair services to many utilities, including our utilities, as well as other industries. Concurrent with the completion of the Merger in 2019, we added two new reportable segments, Indiana Electric Integrated and Infrastructure Services. On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the Infrastructure Services Disposal Group. The transaction closed on April 9, 2020. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s CODM requested that the financial information for the electric businesses be presented on an aggregated basis for review, resulting in one Electric reportable segment, comprised of Houston Electric and Indiana Electric. See Note 18 for further changes on reportable segments during 2020.
To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors net income and cash flows, among other things, from our reportable segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures, we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to our reportable segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer,
commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. From an operational standpoint, we monitor operation and maintenance expense, safety factors, system reliability and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance.
The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. With respect to CERC, we intend to use proceeds from any potential asset sales, including the potential dispositions of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma, to satisfy a portion of its capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, we may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt.
To the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. For example, the economic impacts of COVID-19 have been felt nationwide, with every region of the country experiencing deep reductions in employment in the second quarter of 2020. We believe that all of the states that we serve have improved economically since then and continue to recover, although at different rates. Each state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors. Our largest customers reflect the diversity in industries in the states across our footprint. For example, Houston Electric is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, a diverse economy where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. Although the Houston area represents a large part of our customer base, we have a diverse customer base throughout the eight states our utility businesses serve. In Minnesota, for instance, education and health services are the state’s largest sectors, whereas Arkansas has a large food manufacturing industry. Indiana and Ohio are impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest such as automotive, feed and grain processing. Some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the national or international economy.
Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Long-term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results. However, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed. To the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry, there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand. Despite the overall economic impact of the recession, housing growth has continued and accelerated in 2020. Lower interest rates have helped single family housing starts in the Houston and Minneapolis to exceed growth in previous years. Multifamily residential customer growth is affected by the cyclical nature of apartment construction. Beginning in 2019 and continuing through 2020, a new construction cycle in Houston helped overall residential customer growth to surpass the long-term trend of 2%. Management expects residential meter growth for Houston Electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. Typical customer growth in the jurisdictions served by the Natural Gas reportable segment is approximately 1%. CERC’s Natural Gas customer growth was 1.7% for 2020, which is slightly higher than in previous years. Management expects residential meter growth for CERC to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 1%.
Performance of the Electric reportable segment and the Natural Gas reportable segment is significantly influenced by energy usage per customer, which is significantly impacted by weather conditions. For Houston Electric, revenues are generally higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes. For Indiana Electric, a significant portion of its sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather. For CERC’s Natural Gas, demand for natural gas for heating purposes is generally higher in the colder months. Therefore, we compare our results on a weather-adjusted basis.
In 2020, the Houston area experienced weather that was warmer than normal compared to 2019. Although the summer months were somewhat hotter than normal, the warmer than normal temperatures started early in the year with a mild winter. Our Natural Gas service territories experienced warmer weather in 2020 than it has since 2017. Historically, both CenterPoint Energy’s TDU and CERC’s Natural Gas have utilized weather hedges to help reduce the impact of mild weather on their financial results. CenterPoint Energy’s TDU and CERC’s Natural Gas entered into a weather hedge for the 2019-2020 winter heating season in Texas where no weather normalization mechanisms exist. In CERC’s non-Texas jurisdictions, weather
normalization mechanisms or decoupling in the Minnesota division help to mitigate the impact of abnormal weather on our financial results.
In our Natural Gas Indiana and Ohio service territories, normal temperature adjustment and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. Our Natural Gas operations in Ohio has a straight fixed variable rate design for its residential customers. This rate design mitigates approximately 90% of the Ohio service territory’s weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption specific to its small customer classes. While Indiana Electric has neither a normal temperature adjustment mechanism nor a decoupling mechanism, rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that operates in tandem with conservation initiatives.
Sales of natural gas to residential and commercial customers by Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO are largely seasonal and are impacted by weather. Trends in the average consumption among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as these utilities have implemented conservation programs.
For CERC’s Natural Gas in Minnesota and Arkansas, rate adjustment mechanisms counter the impact of changes in customer usage. In addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and Minnesota, as applicable to each registrant, we have benefited from growth in the number of customers. We anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions’ economies continue to grow. The profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and natural gas distribution rates.
For details related to our pending and completed regulatory proceedings and orders in 2020 and to date in 2021, see “-Liquidity and Capital Resources -Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.
We believe the long-term outlook for ESG’s performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure opportunities remains strong with continued national focus expected on energy conservation and sustainability, renewable energy and security as power prices across the country rise and customer focus on new, efficient and clean sources of energy grows.
The regulation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s businesses. In accordance with natural gas pipeline safety and integrity regulations, CenterPoint Energy and CERC are making, and will continue to make, significant capital investments in their service territories, which are necessary to help operate and maintain a safe, reliable and growing natural gas system. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s compliance expenses may also increase as a result of preventative measures required under these regulations. Consequently, new rates in the areas they serve are necessary to recover these increasing costs.
Consistent with the regulatory treatment of pension costs, the Registrants defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in the Registrants’ base rates for the Electric reportable segment and Natural Gas reportable segment in their Texas jurisdictions. CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a minimum of approximately $61 million to its pension plans in 2021.
Factors Influencing Midstream Investments (CenterPoint Energy)
The results of CenterPoint Energy’s Midstream Investments reportable segment are dependent upon the results of Enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that Enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems. These volumes depend significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to Enable’s systems across a number of U.S. mid-continent markets. Aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities. Production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity, because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over time.
Enable expects its business to continue to be impacted by the trends affecting the midstream industry. Enable’s outlook is based on its management’s assumptions regarding the impact of these trends that it has developed by interpreting the information currently available to it. If Enable management’s assumptions or interpretation of available information prove to be incorrect, Enable’s future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from its expectations.
Enable’s business is impacted by commodity prices, which have remained historically low and otherwise experienced significant volatility in recent years, including due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors. Commodity prices impact the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil in the areas served by Enable’s systems, and the volumes
on its systems can be negatively impacted if producers decrease drilling and production in those areas served. A decrease in volumes on Enable’s systems due to a decrease in drilling or production by its producer customers could adversely affect Enable’s results. In addition, Enable’s processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. Enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges, focusing on contracting fee-based business and converting existing commodity-based contracts to fee-based contracts. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil had begun to decline due to oversupply. The price of, and global demand for, these commodities declined significantly during the first half of 2020 as a result of the ongoing economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, which was further exacerbated by the dispute in the first quarter of 2020 over crude oil production levels between Russia and members of OPEC led by Saudi Arabia. For further information on the impact of these conditions on Enable, see “Significant Events-Enable Quarterly Distributions” below. Subsequent to an agreement in April 2020 by a coalition of nations to reduce production of crude oil and the increase in global economic activity as governmental measures implemented to control the pandemic have eased, the price of crude oil has begun to rise relative to the 2020 production low. In response to crude oil price increases, crude oil, associated natural gas and NGL production has begun to increase.
Enable’s long-term view is that natural gas and crude oil will continue to be a critical component of energy demand in the United States and worldwide because natural gas has lower emissions and is a practical fuel for a variety of applications. As electric energy demand continues to grow, Enable’s management believes that natural gas will continue to replace coal. As the global market for LNG continues to develop, Enable’s management believes that natural gas supply in the United States is well positioned to address demand in the United States, as well as in other areas of the world, including Western Europe and Asia. As the desire to lower emissions continues, Enable’s management believes that natural gas will be seen as a practical alternative to higher-emissions liquids fuels, such as bunker fuels in international shipping. Supplies of crude oil have risen primarily from the success of unconventional drilling in tight oil plays across the United States. Liquid fuels derived from crude oil have remained a primary source of energy in the United States, and exports of crude oil and liquid fuels from the United States have risen dramatically over the last five years. As the supply of crude oil has increased in the United States, Enable’s management believes that the United States will continue to be a source of supply to the global crude oil market.
For information on the Enable Merger, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Significant Events
February 2021 Winter Storm Event. In February 2021, portions of the United States experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event resulting in corresponding electricity generation shortages, including in Texas, and natural gas shortages and increased wholesale prices of natural gas in the United States. Many Houston Electric and, to a lesser extent, CERC customers have been severely impacted by outages in electricity and natural gas delivery during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. As a result of this weather event, the governors of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana have declared states of either disaster or emergencies in their respective states. Subsequently, President Biden also approved major disaster declarations for all or parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
CenterPoint Energy has a corporate response planning team comprised of employees across the organization, including members of senior management, that assesses risks to its business, including for health, safety and environmental matters and personnel issues, and has addressed various impacts of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event as such impacts have developed. The corporate response planning team has coordinated additional support for operations and other personnel responding directly to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.
The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has had, and may continue to have, financial impacts on CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC, including substantial increases in prices for natural gas, decreased revenues at Houston Electric due to ERCOT-mandated outages, the need to raise additional external financing to pay for natural gas working capital, potential impacts to credit metrics, significant impacts to the REPs serving customers of Houston Electric, including the REPs’ ability to pay invoices, increases in bad debt expense, issues with counterparties and customers, litigation and investigations or inquiries from government or regulatory agencies and entities, and other financial impacts. CenterPoint Energy does not anticipate meaningful long-term changes to its credit profile or credit ratings given its anticipated access to external financing sources and the regulatory mechanisms that are in place to recover these excess costs. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” and “ - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Future Sources and Uses of Cash” below for further information.
COVID-19 Impacts. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. In response to these declarations and the rapid spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local governments have imposed varying degrees of restrictions on business and social activities to contain COVID-19, including business shutdowns and closures, travel restrictions, quarantines,
curfews, shelter in place and “stay-at-home” orders in our service territories. State and local authorities have also implemented multi-step policies with the goal of re-opening various sectors of the economy such as retail establishments, health and personal care businesses, and restaurants, among others. Governing authorities continue to reassess re-opening approaches and decisions for their respective jurisdictions given the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The COVID-19 outbreak significantly worsened in the United States during the winter months, which caused federal, state and local governments to reconsider restrictions on business and social activities, resulting in the curtailment of the re-opening of the economy.
We have experienced some resulting disruptions to our business operations, as these restrictions significantly impacted, and may continue to impact, many sectors of the economy with various businesses curtailing or ceasing normal operations. For example, since mid-March 2020, we have had to restrict access to certain office locations around the United States. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we have increased the permitted occupancy of certain of our offices and facilities. The rest of our office-based personnel continue to be productive through alternate work arrangements, leveraging a strong technology platform to support our employees working remotely to perform their duties or directly from their vehicles to serve our customers. Where we must maintain a presence in the field, we have adjusted our operational protocols to minimize exposure and risk to our field personnel, customers and the communities we serve, including, among other things, modifying our work schedules and reporting locations, potentially delaying certain work types as appropriate, such as maintenance and capital projects, and adjusting project scope and scale to adhere to safety protocols, while continuing to maintain the work activities necessary for safe and reliable service to our customers with increased safety precautions. While certain of our personnel have been, and may continue to be, quarantined, our operations and corporate functions have not been adversely affected to date.
Certain of our Natural Gas service territories were impacted by Hurricane Laura in August 2020, as well as Hurricanes Sally, Delta and Zeta in October 2020. While our Natural Gas field personnel assessed and stabilized our impacted Natural Gas facilities, our electric operations mutual assistance crews from Texas and Indiana worked safely to support the storm restoration efforts of other impacted utilities. Despite COVID-19 conditions, neither our personnel nor our facilities experienced significant performance or operational impacts from Hurricanes Laura, Sally, Delta and Zeta.
Our first priority in our response to this pandemic has been the health and safety of our employees, our customers and other business counterparties. Because we provide a critical service to our customers, it is paramount that we keep our employees who operate our business safe and informed, and we have taken and are updating precautions for that purpose. We have implemented preventative measures and developed corporate and regional response plans to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and prevent infection, while supporting our customers’ operations under the circumstances. When an employee tests positive for COVID-19, we investigate appropriately and take action to identify and notify potentially exposed individuals, coordinate testing and clean work locations, among other precautionary measures. If our employees feel sick or are awaiting COVID-19 test results, they do not report to their respective work locations to protect the health and safety of other employees. In addition, we have assessed and updated our existing business continuity plans for each of our business units in the context of this pandemic. We have a corporate response planning team who assesses risks to our business, including for health, safety and environmental matters and personnel issues, and addresses various impacts of the situation, as they have developed. Throughout the year, this corporate response planning team has provided periodic updates on COVID-19 to the Board of Directors, which has responsibility for, and is actively involved in, the oversight of risks that could impact CenterPoint Energy. We also have modified certain business practices (including those related to employee travel, employee work locations and participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and other governmental and regulatory authorities. We are continuing to address concerns to protect the health and safety of our employees and those of our customers and other business counterparties, and this includes changes to comply with health-related guidelines as they are modified and supplemented. We are continuing to work with our suppliers on any potential impacts to our supply chain, including identifying any negative impacts to material supplies, working to mitigate them and pre-planning for longer-term emergency response protocols. Since March 2020, we have not experienced significant disruptions or challenges with respect to our supply chain from the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the aforementioned efforts with our core vendors and suppliers. This is a continuously evolving situation and could lead to further disruption of economic activity in our markets; we will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers and our suppliers and take additional precautions as we believe are warranted.
The extended slowdown of economic growth, decreased demand for commodities and material changes in governmental or regulatory policy in the United States has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower growth, including, in certain instances, customer growth, and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in our service territories as customer facilities continue to close or remain closed. While residential electric usage has increased as individuals continue to stay at home or work remotely, our business has experienced reduced demand and usage among our electric and natural gas commercial and industrial customers as well as a decrease in revenues from disconnections and reconnections due to the disconnect moratoriums across our service territories due to COVID-19, which have either expired or may expire during the
second quarter of 2021 in certain of the Registrants’ service territories. Certain aspects of Houston Electric’s rate design could mitigate the negative impact of reduced demand among commercial and industrial users. The ability of our customers, contractors and suppliers to meet their obligations to us, including payment obligations, has also been negatively impacted under the current economic conditions. For Houston Electric, we are following PUCT orders regarding disconnection practices related to those customers impacted by COVID-19. Benefits under the COVID-19 ERP ended on September 30, 2020. Houston Electric has not experienced significant impacts with respect to its REPs meeting their payment obligations since March 2020. In our Natural Gas service territories and for Indiana Electric, we informed customers that disconnections for non-payment had been temporarily suspended and in certain service territories continue to be temporarily suspended. However, the disconnect moratoriums have expired in certain of the Registrants’ service territories. As a result of the disconnect moratoriums across our Natural Gas service territories and other payment deferrals or arrangements, days outstanding on receivables and uncollectible accounts have increased, resulting in an increase to allowance for credit losses. To the extent these conditions in our service territories persist, our bad debt expense from uncollectible accounts could continue to increase, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our Natural Gas service territories and Indiana Electric have either (1) received authority from their public utility commissions to defer bad debt expense associated with COVID-19 as a regulatory asset or (2) exercised existing authority to recover bad debt expense through an existing tracking mechanism. Additionally, while we have not experienced delays to date due to COVID-19 with respect to our regulatory proceedings, we could experience significant delays in scheduling proceedings or hearings and in obtaining orders from regulatory agencies. Any such delays could adversely affect our future results of operations.
Due to macroeconomic conditions related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in our Common Stock price, we identified a triggering event to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020 and recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $185 million in our Indiana Electric Integrated reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020. For further discussion of this impairment, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. CenterPoint Energy and CERC performed their annual goodwill impairment tests in the third quarter of 2020 and determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit as a result of those tests. No triggering events occurred and no impairment tests were performed for subsequent periods.
As of the date of this Form 10-K, our electric facilities and natural gas distribution systems have remained operational and our customers have continued to receive service. Although we continue to assess the COVID-19 situation, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the full financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Nor can we predict the effect that the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the markets will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations at this time. However, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to adversely impact us in future quarters due to the considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns. Restrictions of this nature have caused, and may continue to cause, us, our suppliers and other business counterparties to experience operational delays, closures or disruptions, among other things. The ultimate impacts to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows will depend on future developments and evolving factors, including, among others, the ultimate duration, scope and spread of COVID-19, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the development and availability of effective treatments, including those who may or may not take advantage of such treatments, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume. For additional discussion regarding risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.
Enable Quarterly Distributions. The price of, and global demand for, natural gas, NGLs and crude oil declined significantly in the first half of 2020 in part as a result of the ongoing spread and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of COVID-19 and remained depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Further, financial market declines and volatility, together with deteriorating credit, liquidity concerns, decreasing production, and increasing inventories, are conditions that are associated with a general economic downturn. Producers announced and began to implement plans to reduce production and decrease the drilling and completion of wells in response to these conditions, which include reductions in the exploration, development and production activity across Enable’s areas of operation. As a result, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in demand and price for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil have and may continue to negatively impact the demand for midstream services. In response to the impacts of these developments on its business, on April 1, 2020, Enable announced a reduction in its quarterly distributions per common unit from $0.3305 distributed for the fourth quarter 2019 to $0.16525, representing a 50% reduction. To the extent such economic conditions persist or further deteriorate, quarterly distributions on Enable’s common units may be subject to further reductions. For further information, see “-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Future Sources and Uses of Cash” below.
CenterPoint Energy Financial Measures. On April 1, 2020, in response to the current business environment and to strengthen its financial position and adjust for the reduction in cash flow related to the reduction in Enable quarterly common unit distributions, CenterPoint Energy announced targeted reductions in (i) its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.1500 per share; (ii) 2020 operation and maintenance expenses, excluding certain merger costs, utility costs to achieve savings, severance and amounts with revenue offsets; and (iii) 2020 capital spending. For further information, see “-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Future Sources and Uses of Cash” below.
Enable Investment Impairment. CenterPoint Energy recognized a loss of $1,428 million on its investment in Enable for the year ended December 31, 2020. This loss included an impairment charge on its investment in Enable of $1,541 million and CenterPoint Energy’s interest in Enable’s $225 million impairment on an equity method investment. For further discussion, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Board of Director Appointments. On May 6, 2020, the Board of Directors appointed David J. Lesar and Barry T. Smitherman to the Board of Directors effective immediately.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for electricity and natural gas. CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates its subsidiaries charge, debt service costs, income tax expense, its subsidiaries ability to collect receivables from REPs and customers and its ability to recover its regulatory assets. For information regarding factors that may affect the future results of our consolidated operations, please read “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Income (loss) available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:
(1)Includes only February 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 results of acquired electric and natural gas businesses due to the Merger.
(2)For a discussion of earnings from CenterPoint Energy’s equity investment in Enable, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)Includes energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services through ESG, unallocated corporate costs, interest income and interest expense, intercompany eliminations and the reduction of income allocated to preferred shareholders.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net Income. CenterPoint Energy reported a loss available to common shareholders of $949 million for 2020 compared to income available to common shareholders of $674 million for 2019.
The decrease in income available to common shareholders of $1,623 million was primarily due to the following key factors:
•the impairment of our investment in Enable, our share of Enable’s impairment of an equity method investment and decreased earnings at Enable further discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements;
•the impairment of Indiana Electric further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements;
•loss and impairments on held for sale of the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services Disposal Groups;
•impacts related to COVID-19; and
•increased preferred stock dividend requirements.
These decreases were partially offset by:
•rate relief;
•continued customer growth;
•operation and maintenance expense discipline; and
•the impact of twelve months in 2020 versus eleven months in 2019 for businesses acquired in the Merger.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net Income. CenterPoint Energy reported income available to common shareholders of $674 million for 2019 compared to $333 million for 2018.
The increase in income available to common shareholders of $341 million was primarily due to the following key factors:
•gains on marketable securities, net of losses on the underlying value of the indexed debt securities related to the ZENS;
•the impact of eleven months of results in 2019 for businesses acquired in the Merger;
•rate relief;
•continued customer growth; and
•operation and maintenance expense discipline.
These increases were partially offset by:
•increased interest expense primarily resulting from higher outstanding long-term debt used to finance the Merger and additional long-term debt acquired in the Merger, discussed further in Notes 4 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements;
•decreased earnings at Enable further discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements; and
•increased preferred stock dividend requirements.
Discontinued Operations. On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the Infrastructure Services Disposal Group. Accordingly, the previously reported Infrastructure Services reportable segment has been eliminated. The transaction closed on April 9, 2020. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell the Energy Services Disposal Group. Accordingly, the previously reported Energy Services reportable segment has been eliminated. The transaction closed on June 1, 2020. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Income Tax Expense. For a discussion of effective tax rate per period, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
CENTERPOINT ENERGY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT
As of January 1, 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s CODM viewed net income as the measure of profit or loss for the reportable segments rather than the previous measure of operating income. Segment results include inter-segment interest income and expense, which may result in inter-segment profit and loss. During the fourth quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s CODM requested that the financial information for the electric businesses be presented on an aggregated basis for review, resulting in one Electric reportable segment, comprised of Houston Electric and Indiana Electric. Also, the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment was renamed Natural Gas. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s CODM requested that the CERC corporate functions be included within the financial results of CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas reportable segment for review purposes. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Following the divestiture of the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services Disposal Groups, which accounted for a substantial portion of CenterPoint Energy’s non-utility activities, CenterPoint Energy is now focused on its utility operations conducted through two reportable segments, Electric and Natural Gas, which are collectively referred to herein as Utility Operations. The following discussion of results of operations by reportable segment concentrates on CenterPoint Energy’s Utility Operations. A discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s Midstream Investments reportable segment results is included in the discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated results above.
ELECTRIC
The following table provides summary data of CenterPoint Energy’s Electric reportable segment:
(1)Includes only February 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 results of acquired electric businesses due to the Merger.
(2)For information related to the goodwill impairment at the Indiana Electric reporting unit, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

HOUSTON ELECTRIC CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As of January 1, 2020, Houston Electric’s CODM viewed net income as the measure of profit or loss for the reportable segments rather than the previous measure of operating income. Houston Electric consists of a single reportable segment. Houston Electric’s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for electricity. Houston Electric’s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates Houston Electric charges, debt service costs, income tax expense, Houston Electric’s ability to collect receivables from REPs and Houston Electric’s ability to recover its regulatory assets. For information regarding factors that may affect the future results of Houston Electric’s consolidated operations, please read “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.

CERC CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As of January 1, 2020, CERC’s CODM viewed net income as the measure of profit or loss for the reportable segments rather than the previous measure of operating income. During the fourth quarter of 2020, CERC’s CODM requested that the CERC corporate functions be included within the financial results of CERC’s Natural Gas reportable segment for review purposes. As a result of this change and following the divestiture of the Energy Services Disposal Group, CERC now consists of a single reportable segment, Natural Gas, formerly named Natural Gas Distribution. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. CERC’s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas. CERC’s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various federal, state and local governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates CERC charges, debt service costs and income tax expense, CERC’s ability to collect receivables from customers and CERC’s ability to recover its regulatory assets. For information regarding factors that may affect the future results of CERC’s consolidated operations, please read “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
(1)Includes Utility natural gas and Non-utility cost of revenues, including natural gas.
Discontinued Operations. On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell the Energy Services Disposal Group. Accordingly, the previously reported Energy Services reportable segment has been eliminated. The transaction closed on June 1, 2020. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:
Operating Activities. The following items contributed to increased (decreased) net cash provided by operating activities:
(1)This change is partially offset by the change in distributions from Enable in excess of cumulative earnings in investing activities noted in the table below.
Investing Activities. The following items contributed to (increased) decreased net cash used in investing activities:
(1)The increase in capital expenditures in 2019 primarily resulted from businesses acquired in the Merger.
Financing Activities. The following items contributed to (increased) decreased net cash used in financing activities:
Future Sources and Uses of Cash
The liquidity and capital requirements of the Registrants are affected primarily by results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. Capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure for electric and natural gas distribution operations. These capital expenditures are anticipated to maintain reliability and safety, increase resiliency and expand our systems through value-added projects. In addition to dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock, and in addition to interest payments on debt, the Registrants’ principal anticipated cash requirements for 2021 include the following:
February 2021 Winter Storm Event. In February 2021, portions of the United States experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event resulting in corresponding electricity generation shortages, including in Texas, and natural gas shortages and increased prices of natural gas in the United States. As a result of this weather event, the governors of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana have declared states of either disaster or emergencies in their respective states. Subsequently, President Biden also approved major disaster declarations for all or parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
As a result of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, from February 12, 2021 to February 22, 2021, management estimates CenterPoint Energy spent approximately an incremental $2.5 billion more on natural gas supplies compared to plan (inclusive
of an incremental $2.3 billion more spent by CERC on natural gas supplies compared to plan). These amounts are preliminary estimates through February 23, 2021 and are subject to final settlement. On February 13, 2021, the Railroad Commission authorized each Texas natural gas distribution utility to record in a regulatory asset the extraordinary expenses associated with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, including, but not limited to, natural gas cost and other costs related to the procurement and transportation of natural gas supply, subject to recovery in future proceedings. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas utilities in their jurisdictions outside of Texas have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms to recover the increased cost of natural gas. While CenterPoint Energy and CERC will seek to recover the increased costs from its customers (although neither full recovery nor the timing of that recovery is certain), in the interim, CenterPoint Energy and CERC will seek additional external financing to pay for such natural gas working capital, which may consist of short and long-term debt, but such external financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. On February 24, 2021, CERC received financing commitments totaling $1.7 billion on a 364-day term loan facility to bridge this working capital need. CERC will evaluate whether to execute of this facility or other potential financing alternatives. Management believes that these commitments, along with existing sources of liquidity, provide CERC with sufficient capital to address the anticipated settlement of natural gas purchases, including the associated upstream supply charges, at the end of March 2021. Any additional external debt financing and/or partial or delayed recovery may negatively impact CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s credit metrics, and may lead to a downgrade of CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s credit rating.
Although CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s excess costs from the increase in natural gas prices are mitigated by available natural gas recovery mechanisms in their jurisdictions, until such amounts are ultimately recovered from customers, CenterPoint Energy and CERC will continue to incur increased finance-related costs, resulting in a significant use of cash. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
The Registrants expect that anticipated 2021 cash needs will be met with borrowings under their credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, term loans or common stock, anticipated cash flows from operations, with respect to CenterPoint Energy and CERC, proceeds from commercial paper, with respect to CenterPoint Energy, distributions from Enable until the closing of the Enable Merger expected in the second half of 2021, including any proceeds therefrom, distributions from Energy Transfer or proceeds from dispositions of Energy Transfer common units or Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units after the closing of the Enable Merger, and, with respect to CERC, proceeds from any potential asset sales, including the potential dispositions of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma, should such dispositions close in 2021. Discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity securities of CenterPoint Energy or debt securities of the Registrants in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities or term bank loans. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available on acceptable terms.
The following table sets forth the Registrants’ actual capital expenditures by reportable segment for 2020 and estimates of the Registrants’ capital expenditures currently planned for projects for 2021 through 2025:
(1)On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell the Energy Services Disposal Group, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the historically reported Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction closed on June 1, 2020. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2) Houston Electric consists of a single reportable segment, Houston Electric T&D.
(3)On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within the Infrastructure Services Disposal Group. The transaction closed on April 9, 2020. For further information, see Notes 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
The following table sets forth estimates of the Registrants’ contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, including payments due by period:
(1)ZENS obligations are included in the 2026 and thereafter column at their contingent principal amount of $56 million as of December 31, 2020. These obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS ($871 million as of December 31, 2020), as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)The Registrants calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, the Registrants calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, the Registrants used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2020. The Registrants typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
(3)For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
(4)See Note 8(g) to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Registrants’ expected contributions to pension plans and other postretirement plans in 2021.
(5)For a discussion of commodity and other commitments, please read Note 16(a) to the consolidated financial statements.
(6)This table does not include estimated future payments for expected future AROs. These payments are primarily estimated to be incurred after 2026. See Note 3(c) to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Other than Houston Electric’s first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds issued as collateral for tax-exempt long-term debt of CenterPoint Energy (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and operating leases, the Registrants have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Regulatory Matters
COVID-19 Regulatory Matters
Governors, public utility commissions and other authorities in the states in which we operate have issued a number of different orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including orders addressing customer non-payment and disconnection. While certain jurisdictions are subject to mandatory stay-at-home and similar orders, essential businesses and activities are exempted from these orders, including utility operations and maintenance. Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy’s crews continue to provide essential service by responding to calls, completing work orders and undertaking other critical work. To protect our customers and employees, we have implemented COVID-19 safety precautions. Although the disconnect moratoriums have either expired or may expire during the second quarter of 2021 in certain of the Registrants’ service territories, CenterPoint Energy continues to support those customers who may need payment assistance, arrangements or extensions. We will continue to monitor developments in this area and adjust our response as guidelines and circumstances may require. Additionally, while we have not experienced delays to date due to COVID-19 with respect to our regulatory proceedings, we could experience significant delays in scheduling proceedings or hearings and in obtaining orders from regulatory agencies.
On March 26, 2020, the PUCT issued two orders related to COVID-19 issues that affect Houston Electric. First, the PUCT issued an order related to Accrual of Regulatory Assets granting authority for utilities to record as a regulatory asset costs resulting from the effects of COVID-19. In the order, the PUCT noted that it will consider whether a utility’s request for recovery of the regulatory asset is reasonable and necessary in a future proceeding. Second, the PUCT issued an order related to COVID-19 ERP, as modified, which, in light of the disaster declarations issued by the Governor of Texas, authorized a customer assistance program for certain residential customers of electric service in areas of Texas open to customer choice, which includes Houston Electric’s service territory. The order included several requirements for transmission and distribution utilities (including Houston Electric):
▪Transmission and distribution utilities must file a tariff rider to collect funds to reimburse costs related to unpaid bills from eligible residential customers unemployed due to the impacts of COVID-19. The rider is based on $0.33 per MW hour ($0.00033 per KW hour) to be applied to all customer classes. Houston Electric filed its updated tariff implementing the rider on March 31, 2020, which was approved by the PUCT on April 2, 2020.
▪Transmission and distribution utilities entered into no-interest loan agreements with ERCOT to provide for an initial fund balance for reimbursement. On April 13, 2020, in connection with the PUCT’s COVID-19 ERP, Houston Electric entered into a no-interest loan agreement with ERCOT pursuant to which ERCOT loaned Houston Electric approximately $5 million.
▪The fund administered by each transmission and distribution utility for the COVID-19 ERP can also receive donations and grants from governmental entities, corporations, and other entities. Any funds received from other sources shall be administered and treated in the same manner by the transmission and distribution utilities as the funds in the program from the rider.
▪Transmission and distribution utilities may petition the PUCT for changes to the COVID-19 ERP, including the level of the rider in the event that the funds collected are not sufficient to cover reimbursements.
▪REPs will identify eligible customers to the relevant transmission and distribution utilities, and the transmission and distribution utilities will cease charging REPs for associated delivery charges, except securitization related charges.
REPs will cease submitting disconnection for non-payment orders to transmission and distribution utilities for eligible customers.
▪The funds collected through the rider will be used to reimburse the following entities and costs: REPs’ energy charges related to eligible residential customers with an unpaid, past due electric bill subject to a disconnection for non-payment notice (reimbursement amounts are based on an average energy cost of $0.04 per KW hour); transmission and distribution utilities’ delivery charges related to eligible residential customers with an unpaid, past due electric bill subject to a disconnection for non-payment notice; the third-party administrator to cover its reasonable costs of administering the COVID-19 ERP eligibility process; and ERCOT for the loan to the transmission and distribution utilities.
▪REPs will submit one spreadsheet with reimbursement claims to transmission and distribution utilities beginning on April 30, 2020 and all subsequent requests that may be made on the 15th of each month, and transmission and distribution utilities will process reimbursement payments within 14 days.
▪Transmission and distribution utilities will prepare reports and file them at the PUCT every 30 days showing aggregate amounts of reimbursements to the transmission and distribution utilities and REPs.
The PUCT issued an order on August 27, 2020 to conclude the COVID-19 ERP. The PUCT determined that enrollment in the COVID-19 ERP would end on August 31, 2020, and benefits under the program ended on September 30, 2020. Final claims for reimbursement were required to be submitted to transmission and distribution utilities by November 30, 2020. Final program reports were required to be submitted to the PUCT by January 15, 2021. The transmission and distribution utilities riders remained in place and reimbursements continued after the end of the COVID-19 ERP to complete any remaining COVID-19 ERP cost recovery and disburse all reimbursement amounts or remaining balances.
Commissions in all of Indiana Electric’s and CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas service territories have either (1) issued orders to record a regulatory asset for incremental bad debt expenses related to COVID-19, including costs associated with the suspension of disconnections and payment plans or (2) provided authority to recover bad debt expense through an existing tracking mechanism.
In some of the states in which the Registrants operate, public utility commissions have authorized utilities to employ deferred accounting authority for certain COVID-19 related costs which ensure the safety and health of customers, employees, and contractors, that would not have been incurred in the normal course of business. CERC’s Natural Gas service territories in Minnesota and Arkansas will include any offsetting savings in the deferral. Other jurisdictions where the Registrants operate may require them to offset the deferral with savings as well.
Houston Electric Base Rate Case (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)
On April 5, 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates, seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately $194 million, among other requests. On January 23, 2020, Houston Electric filed a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the PUCT that provides for the following, among other things:
•an overall revenue requirement increase of approximately $13 million;
•an ROE of 9.4%;
•a capital structure of 57.5% debt/42.5% equity;
•a refund of unprotected EDIT of $105 million plus carrying costs over approximately 30-36 months; and
•recovery of all retail transmission related costs through the TCRF.
Also, Houston Electric is not required to make a one-time refund of capital recovery from its TCOS and DCRF mechanisms. Future TCOS filings will take into account both ADFIT and EDIT until the final order from Houston Electric’s next base rate proceeding. No rate base items are required to be written off; however, approximately $12 million in rate case expenses were written off in 2019. A base rate application must be filed for Houston Electric no later than four years from the date of the PUCT’s final order in the proceeding. Additionally, Houston Electric will not file a DCRF in 2020, nor will a subsequent separate proceeding with the PUCT be instituted regarding EDIT on Houston Electric’s securitized assets. Furthermore, under the terms of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed to adopt certain ring-fencing measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy but left the determination of whether to impose a dividend restriction up to the PUCT. The PUCT approved the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement at its February 14, 2020
open meeting and issued a final order on March 9, 2020. The PUCT declined to impose a dividend restriction in the final order. The rates were implemented on April 23, 2020.
CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric record pre-tax expense for (i) probable disallowances of capital investments and (ii) customer refund obligations and costs deferred in regulatory assets when recovery of such amounts is no longer considered probable.
Bailey to Jones Creek Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)
In April 2017, Houston Electric submitted a proposal to ERCOT requesting its endorsement of the Freeport Area Master Plan, which included the Bailey to Jones Creek Project. On November 21, 2019, the PUCT issued its final approval of Houston Electric’s certificate of convenience and necessity application, based on an unopposed settlement agreement under which Houston Electric would construct the project at an estimated cost of approximately $483 million. The actual capital costs of the project will depend on land acquisition costs, construction costs, minor changes to the routing of the line to mitigate environmental and other land use impacts, structure design to address soil and coastal wind conditions, and other factors. In April 2020, a federal court vacated the Army Corps of Engineers Nationwide Permit 12, which Houston Electric intended to use for the project. As a result, Houston Electric filed its individual permit application with the Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with the federal court decision. However, subsequent to filing the individual permit application, the federal court stayed the effectiveness of its order as it applied to the construction of transmission lines such as the Bailey to Jones Creek Project. In July 2020, the stay was extended by the U.S. Supreme Court to apply to a broader range of infrastructure projects and is expected to last through the full appellate process. As a result, the Army Corps of Engineers proceeded with project review under the general Nationwide Permit 12 permit and authorized construction in the impacted areas in November 2020. Houston Electric commenced pre-construction activities on the project in 2019, began construction in 2021 and anticipates completing construction and energizing the line before the end of 2021.
Space City Solar Transmission Interconnection Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)
On December 17, 2020, Houston Electric filed a certificate of convenience and necessity application with the PUCT for approval to build a 345 kV transmission line in Wharton County, Texas connecting the Hillje substation on Houston Electric’s transmission system to the planned 610 MW Space City Solar Generation facility being developed by third-party developer EDF Renewables. Depending on the route ultimately approved by the PUCT, the estimated capital cost of the transmission line project ranges from approximately $23 million to $71 million. The actual capital costs of the project will depend on actual land acquisition costs, construction costs, and other factors in addition to route selection. In January 2021, Houston Electric executed a Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement for the Space City Solar Generation facility with EDF Renewables, which also provided security for the transmission line project in the form of a $23 million Letter of Credit, the amount of which is subject to change depending on the route approved. The PUCT is required to issue its final approval on the transmission line project no later than December 2021. Subject to PUCT approval, Houston Electric expects to complete construction and energization of the transmission line by June 2022.
Minnesota Base Rate Case (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)
On October 28, 2019, CERC filed a general rate case with the MPUC seeking approval for a revenue increase of approximately $62 million with a projected test year ended December 31, 2020. The revenue increase is based upon a requested ROE of 10.15% and an overall after-tax rate of return of 7.41% on a total rate base of approximately $1,307 million. CERC implemented interim rates reflecting $53 million for gas used on and after January 1, 2020. In September 2020, a settlement that addressed all issues except the Inclusive Financing/Tariffed On Bill Financing (TOB) proposal by the City of Minneapolis was signed by a majority of all parties and was filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings. A stipulation between the City of Minneapolis and CERC addressing the TOB proposal was filed on September 2, 2020. The settlement reflects a $38.5 million increase and was based on an overall after-tax rate of return of 6.86% and does not specify individual cost of capital components. On January 14, 2021, the MPUC verbally approved the $38.5 million increase and decided not to include the TOB proposal in the current case, but recommended a new docket be established to gather further information and stakeholder input. A written final order is expected in March 2021.
Indiana North Base Rate Case (CenterPoint Energy)
On December 18, 2020, Indiana North filed its base rate case with the IURC seeking approval for a revenue increase of approximately $21 million. This rate case filing is required under Indiana TDSIC statutory requirements before the completion of Indiana North’s capital expenditure program, approved in 2014 for investments starting in 2014 through 2020. The revenue increase is based upon a requested ROE of 10.15% and an overall after-tax rate of return of 6.32% on total rate base of
approximately $1,611 million. Indiana North has utilized a projected test year, reflecting its 2021 budget as the basis for the revenue increase requested, and proposes to implement rates in two phases. The first phase of rate implementation will occur as of the date of an order in this proceeding, expected in October 2021, and the second phase of rate implementation will occur at the completion of the test year, as of December 31, 2021. Under Indiana statutory requirements, the IURC has a minimum of 300 days and maximum of 360 days from the date of the filing of Indiana North’s case-in-chief to issue an order.
Indiana South Base Rate Case (CenterPoint Energy)
On October 30, 2020, and as subsequently amended, Indiana South filed its base rate case with the IURC seeking approval for a revenue increase of approximately $29 million. This rate case filing is required under Indiana TDSIC statutory requirements before the completion of Indiana South’s capital expenditure program, approved in 2014 for investments starting in 2014 through 2020. The revenue increase is based upon a requested ROE of 10.15% and an overall after-tax rate of return of 5.99% on total rate base of approximately $469 million. Indiana South has utilized a projected test year, reflecting its 2021 budget as the basis for the revenue increase requested, and proposes to implement rates in two phases. The first phase of rate implementation will occur as of the date of an order in this proceeding, expected in September 2021, and the second phase of rate implementation will occur at the completion of the test year, as of December 31, 2021. Under Indiana statutory requirements, the IURC has a minimum 300 days and maximum of 360 days from the date of the filing of Indiana South’s case-in-chief to issue an order. Intervenor testimony was filed with the IURC on February 19, 2021. Indiana South’s rebuttal testimony is due to be filed with the IURC by March 19, 2021.
Indiana Electric Generation Project (CenterPoint Energy)
Indiana Electric must either (i) make substantial investments in its existing generation resources to comply with environmental regulations or (ii) replace its existing generation with new resources. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP every three years (unless extended) to the IURC that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period. On February 20, 2018, Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace the baseload capacity of its existing generation fleet at an approximate cost of $900 million, which included the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the plant.
As a part of this same proceeding, Indiana Electric also sought recovery under Indiana Senate Bill 251 of costs to be incurred for environmental investments to be made at its F.B. Culley generating plant to comply with ELG and CCR rules. The F.B. Culley investments, estimated to be approximately $95 million, began in 2019 and will allow the F.B. Culley Unit 3 generating facility to comply with environmental requirements and continue to provide generating capacity to Indiana Electric’s customers. Under Indiana Senate Bill 251, Indiana Electric sought authority to recover 80% of the approved costs, including a return, using a tracking mechanism, with the remaining 20% of the costs deferred for recovery in Indiana Electric’s next base rate proceeding.
On April 24, 2019, the IURC issued an order approving the environmental investments proposed for the F.B. Culley generating facility, along with recovery of prior pollution control investments made in 2014. The order denied the proposed gas combined cycle generating facility. Indiana Electric has conducted a new IRP, which was submitted to the IURC in June 2020, to identify an appropriate generation resource portfolio that includes the replacement of 730 MW of coal-fired generation facilities with a significant buildout of renewables supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines.
Indiana Electric A.B. Brown Ash Pond Remediation (CenterPoint Energy)
On August 14, 2019, Indiana Electric filed a petition with the IURC, seeking approval, as a federally mandated project, for the recovery of costs associated with the clean closure of the A.B. Brown ash pond pursuant to Indiana Senate Bill 251. This project, expected to last approximately 14 years, would result in the full excavation and recycling of the ponded ash through agreements with a beneficial reuse entity, totaling approximately $160 million. Under Indiana Senate Bill 251, Indiana Electric seeks authority to recover via a tracking mechanism 80% of the approved costs, with a return on eligible capital investments needed to allow for the extraction of the ponded ash, with the remaining 20% of the costs deferred for recovery in Indiana Electric’s next base rate proceeding. On December 19, 2019 and subsequently on January 10, 2020, Indiana Electric filed a settlement agreement with the intervening parties whereby the costs would be recovered as requested, with an additional commitment by Indiana Electric to offset the federally mandated costs by at least $25 million, representing a combination of total cash proceeds received from the ash reuser and total insurance proceeds to be received from Indiana Electric’s insurers under confidential settlement agreements of litigation filed against the insurers. On May 13, 2020, the IURC approved the
settlement agreement in full. On October 28, 2020, the IURC approved Indiana Electric’s ECA proceeding, which included the initiation of recovery of the federally mandated project costs.
Rate Change Applications
The Registrants are routinely involved in rate change applications before state regulatory authorities. Those applications include general rate cases, where the entire cost of service of the utility is assessed and reset. In addition, Houston Electric is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms (TCOS and DCRF) and annually files to adjust its EECRF. CERC is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms in Texas (GRIP), its cost of service adjustments in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma (FRP, RSP, RRA and PBRC, respectively), its decoupling mechanism in Minnesota, and its energy efficiency cost trackers in Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi and Oklahoma (EECR, CIP, EECR and EECR, respectively). CenterPoint Energy is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms in Indiana (CSIA for gas and TDSIC for electric) and Ohio (DRR), its decoupling mechanism in Indiana (SRC for gas), and its energy efficiency cost trackers in Indiana (EEFC for gas and DSMA for electric) and Ohio (EEFR).
The table below reflects significant applications pending or completed since the Registrants’ combined 2019 Form 10-K was filed with the SEC.
(1)Represents proposed increases (decreases) when effective date and/or approval date is not yet determined. Approved rates could differ materially from proposed rates.
Tax Reform
TCJA-related 2018 tax expense refunds are currently included in the Registrants’ existing rates and are therefore reducing the Registrants’ current annual revenue. The TCJA-related 2018 tax expense refunds for Houston Electric were completed in September 2019. However, in Houston Electric’s rate case filed in April 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, pursuant to the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric will return unprotected EDIT net regulatory liability balance to customers, through a separate rider and its wholesale transmission tariff over approximately three years and the TCJA-related protected EDIT balance over ARAM. As of December 31, 2020, the balances of the net unprotected EDIT regulatory liability and protected EDIT regulatory liability were $66 million and $678 million, respectively.
CenterPoint Energy’s electric and natural gas utilities in Indiana and Ohio currently recover corporate income tax expense in approved rates charged to customers. The IURC and the PUCO both issued orders which initiated proceedings to investigate the impact of the TCJA on utility companies and customers within Indiana and Ohio, respectively. In addition, the IURC and PUCO have ordered each utility to establish regulatory liabilities to record all estimated impacts of tax reform starting January 1, 2018 until the date when rates are adjusted to capture these impacts. In Indiana, in response to Vectren’s pre-Merger filing for proposed changes to its rates and charges to consider the impact of the lower federal income tax rates, the IURC approved an initial reduction to current rates and charges, effective June 1, 2018, to capture the immediate impact of the lower corporate federal income tax rate. The refund of EDIT and regulatory liabilities commenced in November 2018 for Indiana electric customers and in January 2019 for Indiana natural gas customers. In Ohio, the initial rate reduction to current rates and charges became effective upon conclusion of its then pending base rate case on August 28, 2019. In January 2019, an application was filed with the PUCO in compliance with its October 2018 order requiring utilities to file for a request to adjust rates to reflect the impact of the TCJA, requesting authority to implement a rider to flow back to customers the tax benefits realized under the TCJA, including the refund of EDIT and regulatory liabilities. On July 1, 2020, the PUCO approved the initial rate reduction to credit customers for the impact of the TCJA. This credit mechanism results in an amortization of the unprotected balance of EDIT over a period of six years, starting in 2018, with the protected balance amortized in accordance with ARAM. The credit mechanism will be adjusted via an annual filing made each October to reflect projected refunds for each calendar year.
ELG (CenterPoint Energy)
Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA sets technology-based guidelines for water discharges from new and existing electric generation facilities. In September 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric ELG setting stringent technology-based water discharge limits for the electric power industry. The EPA focused this rulemaking on wastewater generated primarily by pollution control equipment necessitated by the comprehensive air regulations, specifically setting strict water discharge limits for arsenic, mercury and selenium for scrubber waste waters. The ELG will be implemented when existing water discharge permits for the plants are renewed. In the case of Indiana Electric’s water discharge permits, in 2017 the IDEM issued final renewals for the F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown power plants. IDEM agreed that units identified for retirement by December 2023 would not be required to install new treatment technology to meet ELG, and approved a 2020 compliance date for dry bottom ash, which has been completed, and a 2023 compliance date for flue gas desulfurization wastewater treatment standards for the remaining coal-fired unit at F.B. Culley.
On April 13, 2017, as part of the U.S. President’s Administration’s regulatory reform initiative, which is focused on the number and nature of regulations, the EPA granted petitions to reconsider the ELG rule, and indicated it would stay the implementation deadlines in the rule during the pendency of the reconsideration. On September 13, 2017, the EPA finalized a rule postponing certain interim compliance dates by two years, but did not postpone the final compliance deadline of December
31, 2023. On April 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded portions of the ELG rule that selected impoundment as the best available technology for legacy wastewater and leachate. On October 13, 2020, the EPA finalized revisions to the ELG rule, which established a two-year extension of the compliance deadline for the prohibition of wet sluicing of bottom ash. However, the ELG rule did not establish alternative deadlines for the prohibition of wet sluicing of fly ash, and the most recent revision to the CCR rule confirmed that ash ponds must commence closure no later than October 2023. As a result, CenterPoint Energy does not currently anticipate any changes to its current compliance plans based upon this most recent ELG update.
CPP and ACE Rule (CenterPoint Energy)
On August 3, 2015, the EPA released its CPP Rule, which required a 32% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015, and that action was immediately followed by litigation ultimately resulting in the U.S. Supreme Court staying implementation of the rule. On August 31, 2018, the EPA published its proposed CPP replacement rule, the ACE Rule, which was finalized on July 8, 2019 and requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units. On January 19, 2021, the ACE Rule was struck down by the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. CenterPoint Energy is currently unable to predict whether the Biden Administration will continue its defense of the CPP or ACE Rule, or what a new replacement rule would look like. On March 1, 2020, CenterPoint Energy announced corporate carbon emission goals, which are expected to be used to guide Indiana Electric’s transition to a low carbon fleet and position Indiana Electric to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements from the Biden administration to further reduce GHG emissions from its electric fleet.
Impact of Legislative Actions & Other Initiatives (CenterPoint Energy)
At this time, compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in GHG emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. While the requirements of a federal or state rule remain uncertain, Indiana Electric will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding GHG emission standards that may affect its electric generating units.
MRT Rate Case (CenterPoint Energy)
In June 2018, MRT filed a general Natural Gas Act rate case, and in October 2019, MRT filed a second rate case. MRT began collecting the rates proposed in the 2018 rate case, subject to refund, on January 1, 2019. On November 5, 2019, as supplemented on December 13, 2019, MRT filed uncontested proposed settlements for the 2018 and 2019 rate cases. The FERC approved both settlements on March 26, 2020, and that order became final on April 25, 2020.
Other Matters
Credit Facilities
The Registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s commercial paper programs. The facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. For further details related to the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, please see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
Based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, the Registrants would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated approximately $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. On February 4, 2021, the Registrants amended and restated each of their revolving credit facilities, which reduced the aggregate capacity of such facilities to $4.0 billion.
As of February 22, 2021, the Registrants had the following revolving credit facilities and utilization of such facilities:
(1)The credit facility was issued by VUHI and is guaranteed by SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO.
Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower makes representations prior to borrowing as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the revolving credit facilities, the spread to LIBOR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating. Each of the Registrant’s credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace LIBOR with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the four revolving credit facilities.
Long-term Debt
For detailed information about the Registrants’ debt issuances in 2020, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
Securities Registered with the SEC
On May 29, 2020, the Registrants filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of Houston Electric’s general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp.’s senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy’s senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of shares of Common Stock, shares of preferred stock, depositary shares, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. The joint shelf registration statement will expire on May 29, 2023. For information related to the Registrants’ debt and equity security issuances in 2020, see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
Temporary Investments
As of February 22, 2021, the Registrants had no temporary investments.
Money Pool
The Registrants participate in a money pool through which they and certain of their subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the CenterPoint Energy money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy’s revolving credit facility or the sale of CenterPoint Energy’s commercial paper. The net funding requirements of the CERC money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CERC’s revolving credit facility or the sale of CERC’s commercial paper. The money pool may not provide sufficient funds to meet the Registrants’ cash needs.
The table below summarizes CenterPoint Energy money pool activity by Registrant as of February 22, 2021:
Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings
The interest on borrowings under the Registrants’ credit facilities is based on their credit ratings. The interest on borrowings under the credit facilities is based on each respective borrower’s credit ratings. As of February 22, 2021, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of the Registrants:
(1)A Moody’s rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of an issuer’s rating over the medium term.
(2)An S&P outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term.
(3)A Fitch rating outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one- to two-year period.
The Registrants cannot assure that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Registrants’ securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants’ ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of the Registrants’ commercial strategies.
A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities. If the Registrants’ credit ratings had been downgraded one notch by S&P and Moody’s from the ratings that existed as of December 31, 2020, the impact on the borrowing costs under the four revolving credit facilities would have been insignificant. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact the Registrants’ ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas reportable segments.
Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper’s guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody’s and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months’ charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $218 million as of December 31, 2020. The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.
ZENS and Securities Related to ZENS (CenterPoint Energy)
If CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS holders thought its liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, some ZENS holders might decide to exchange their ZENS for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and shares of ZENS-Related Securities would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged or otherwise retired and shares of ZENS-Related Securities are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to
the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement or exchange of the ZENS. If all ZENS had been exchanged for cash on December 31, 2020, deferred taxes of approximately $471 million would have been payable in 2020. If all the ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2020, capital gains taxes of approximately $159 million would have been payable in 2020. For additional information about ZENS, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Cross Defaults
Under each of CenterPoint Energy’s (including VUHI’s), Houston Electric’s and CERC’s respective revolving credit facilities, as well as under CenterPoint Energy’s term loan agreement, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $125 million by the borrower or any of their respective significant subsidiaries will cause a default under such borrower’s respective credit facility or term loan agreement. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under its subsidiaries’ debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.
Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures
From time to time, the Registrants consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. The Registrants may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to the Registrants at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. As announced in December 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s business strategy incorporated the Business Review and Evaluation Committee’s recommendations to increase its planned capital expenditures in its electric and Natural Gas businesses to support rate base growth and sell certain of its Natural Gas businesses located in Arkansas and Oklahoma as a means to efficiently finance a portion of such increased capital expenditures, among other recommendations. For further information, see “-Recent Events-Business Review and Evaluation Committee” above.
Additionally, CenterPoint Energy’s process of evaluating and optimizing the various businesses, assets and ownership interests currently held by it considered, among other things, various plans, proposals and other strategic alternatives with respect to Enable and CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable, which may result in the disposition of a portion or all of its ownership interest in Enable. In February 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its support of the Enable Merger, which is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance. CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the Enable Merger, if completed, or from any disposition or reduction of its resulting investment in Energy Transfer. There can be no assurances that any disposal of Energy Transfer common units or Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units will be completed. Any disposal of such securities may involve significant costs and expenses, including in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount. For information regarding the Enable Merger, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Enable Midstream Partners (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)
In September 2018, CERC completed the Internal Spin, after which CERC’s equity investment in Enable met the criteria for discontinued operations classification. As a result, the operations have been classified as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income for the periods presented. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
CenterPoint Energy receives quarterly cash distributions from Enable on its common units and Enable Series A Preferred Units. A reduction in the cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives from Enable could significantly impact CenterPoint Energy’s liquidity. For additional information about cash distributions from Enable and the recently announced Enable Merger, see Notes 11 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Hedging of Interest Expense for Future Debt Issuances
From time to time, the Registrants may enter into interest rate agreements to hedge, in part, volatility in the U.S. treasury rates by reducing variability in cash flows related to interest payments. For further information, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements.
Weather Hedge (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)
CenterPoint Energy and CERC have historically entered into partial weather hedges for certain Natural Gas jurisdictions and electric operations’ Texas service territory to mitigate the impact of fluctuations from normal weather. CenterPoint Energy and CERC remain exposed to some weather risk as a result of the partial hedges. For more information about weather hedges, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements.
Collection of Receivables from REPs (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)
Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. Before conducting business, a REP must register with the PUCT and must meet certain financial qualifications. Nevertheless, adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows. In the event of a REP’s default, Houston Electric’s tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option for Houston Electric to request that the PUCT suspend or revoke the certification of the REP. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. However, Houston Electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement REP or the provider of last resort. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against Houston Electric involving payments it had received from such REP. If a REP were to file for bankruptcy, Houston Electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such REP that are unpaid as of the date the REP filed for bankruptcy. However, PUCT regulations authorize utilities, such as Houston Electric, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity.
Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements
In addition to the above factors, the Registrants’ liquidity and capital resources could also be negatively affected by:
•further reductions in the cash distributions we receive from Enable;
•cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including weather hedging arrangements, and natural gas purchases, natural gas price and natural gas storage activities of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas reportable segment;
•acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased natural gas prices, including as a result of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, and concentration of natural gas suppliers (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);
•increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas, including as a result of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);
•increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities or term loans or the use of alternative sources of financings due to the effects of COVID-19 and the February 2021 Winter Storm Event on capital and other financial markets;
•various legislative or regulatory actions;
•incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives (CenterPoint Energy);
•the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., to satisfy their obligations to CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric, including the negative impact on such ability related to COVID-19 and the February 2021 Winter Storm Event;
•slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher natural gas prices, changing economic conditions, COVID-19 or the February 2021 Winter Storm Event (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);
•the satisfaction of any obligations pursuant to guarantees;
•the outcome of litigation;
•contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and
•various other risks identified in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money
Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, certain provisions in note purchase agreements relating to debt issued by VUHI have the effect of restricting the amount of additional first mortgage bonds issued by SIGECO. For information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the Registrants’ and certain of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of the Registrants’ financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in the Registrants’ historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require the Registrants to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that the Registrants could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. The Registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Registrants’ operating environment changes. The Registrants’ significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The Registrants believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors.
Accounting for Rate Regulation
Accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. CenterPoint Energy, for its Electric and Natural Gas reportable segments, Houston Electric and CERC apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, the Registrants would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. For further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Identifiable Intangibles, Goodwill, Equity Method Investments, and Investments without a Readily Determinable Fair Value
The Registrants review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually, goodwill is tested for impairment as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. Unforeseen events, changes in market conditions, and probable regulatory disallowances, where applicable, could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value due to changes in observable or estimated market value, future cash flows, interest rate, and regulatory matters could result in an impairment charge. The Registrants recorded no impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles, equity method investments, or readily determinable fair value during 2019 and 2018. CenterPoint Energy recognized equity method investment impairment losses during 2020 as discussed below. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized goodwill impairment losses, discussed below, during 2020 and 2019, and the Registrants recorded no impairments to goodwill in 2018.
In connection with its preparation of the financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy and CERC identified triggering events to perform interim goodwill impairment tests for each of their reporting units due to the macroeconomic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related decline in CenterPoint Energy’s Common Stock price. CenterPoint Energy recognized goodwill impairment losses, discussed below, during the year ended December 31, 2020, and CERC recorded no impairments to goodwill within continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. CenterPoint Energy and CERC performed their annual goodwill impairment tests in the third quarter of 2020 and determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit as a result of those tests.
Fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.
Fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses requires the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which includes expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the date of the impairment test. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on results of the impairment tests. CenterPoint Energy and CERC utilized a third-party valuation specialist to determine the key assumptions used in the estimate of fair value for each of its reporting units on the date of its interim and annual goodwill impairment test in 2020.
Annual goodwill impairment test
CenterPoint Energy and CERC completed their 2020 annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2020 and determined, based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches, that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit. The fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.
Although no goodwill impairment resulted from the 2020 annual test, an interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, if CenterPoint Energy’s market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time, or events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit.
Interim goodwill impairment test, excluding assets held for sale
CenterPoint Energy and CERC performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020. The fair value of each reporting unit was derived using an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Based on the results of the test, CenterPoint Energy recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $185 million at its Indiana Electric reporting unit in the year ended December 31, 2020. CERC recorded no goodwill impairment charge in its continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The fair values of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, with the exception of CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric reporting unit. As of March 31, 2020, immediately following the impairment loss recorded by CenterPoint Energy in the three months ended March 31, 2020, Indiana Electric reporting unit’s fair value approximated its carrying value, and the reporting unit had total goodwill of $936 million. The reporting unit is comprised entirely of businesses acquired in the Merger on February 1, 2019, when the carrying value of the acquired assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value and as a result presented the greatest risk for impairment. The primary driver for the decline in fair value as of the March 31, 2020 interim goodwill impairment test date is an increase in discounts rates, or the weighted average cost of capital of market participants, on the rate regulated reporting units due in part to the decline in current macroeconomic conditions from July 1, 2019, the previous annual testing date at that time, to March 31, 2020.
An interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered and goodwill impairments recorded in future periods by CenterPoint Energy or CERC’s reporting units due to any of the following: CenterPoint Energy’s market capitalization falling below book value, adverse macroeconomic environment, turnover in key personnel, events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit, actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected,
significant adverse changes in the operating or regulatory environment, or changes in discount rates or other key assumptions that require judgment and are forward looking in nature.
For further information, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Generally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale, or the disposal group, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell. If a disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business. A disposal group that meets the held for sale criteria and also represents a strategic shift to the Registrant is also reflected as discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Income, and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses from such businesses as income from discontinued operations, net of tax.
On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the Infrastructure Services Disposal Group. In February 2020, certain assets and liabilities representing the Infrastructure Services Disposal Group met the held for sale criteria and represented all of the businesses within the reporting unit. In accordance with the Securities Purchase Agreement, VISCO was converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that was disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units. The sale was considered an asset sale for tax purposes and closed on April 9, 2020.
On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell the Energy Services Disposal Group. This transaction did not include CEIP and its assets or MES. In February 2020, certain assets and liabilities representing the Energy Services Disposal Group met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and represented substantially all of the businesses within the reporting unit. In accordance with the Equity Purchase Agreement, CES was converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that was disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units. The sale was considered an asset sale for tax purposes and closed on June 1, 2020.
CenterPoint Energy and CERC disclosed in the 2019 Form 10-K that an anticipated loss on held for sale of $80 million was expected in 2020 for the Energy Services Disposal Group. The primary driver for the increase in the actual loss on held for sale, including goodwill impairment, recorded by CenterPoint Energy and CERC in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the amounts previously anticipated is a result of an increase in portions of the derivative assets, net of derivative liabilities, excluded from the working capital adjustment within the Equity Purchase Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020. In October 2020, CenterPoint Energy collected the full and final settlement of the working capital adjustment under the Equity Purchase Agreement, and no gains or losses on this transaction are expected in future periods.
For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Equity Method Investments
Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment when factors indicate that a decrease in value of an investment has occurred and the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss, based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment, is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. Based on the severity of the decline in Enable’s common unit price during the three months ended March 31, 2020 due to the macroeconomic conditions related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with Enable’s announcement on April 1, 2020 to reduce its quarterly distributions per common unit by 50%, and the market outlook indicating excess supply and continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry, CenterPoint Energy determined, in connection with its preparation of its financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020, that an other than temporary decrease in the value of its investment in Enable had occurred. CenterPoint Energy wrote down the value of its investment in Enable to its estimated fair value of $848 million as of March 31, 2020 and recognized an impairment charge of $1,541 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Both the income approach and market approach were utilized to estimate the fair value of CenterPoint Energy’s equity investment in Enable, which includes common units, general partner interest, and incentive distribution rights held by CenterPoint Energy through CNP Midstream. Key assumptions in the market approach include recent market transactions of comparable companies and EBITDA to total
enterprise multiples for comparable companies. Due to volatility of the quoted price of Enable’s units, a volume weighted average price was used under the market approach to best approximate fair value at the measurement date. Key assumptions in the income approach include Enable’s forecasted cash distributions, projected cash flows of incentive distribution rights, forecasted growth rate of Enable’s cash distributions beyond 2020, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows. A weighing of the different approaches was utilized to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in Enable. CenterPoint Energy based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections.
The determination of fair value considered a number of relevant factors including Enable’s common unit price and forecasted distributions, recent comparable transactions and the limited float of Enable’s publicly traded common units. It is reasonably possible that the fair value of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable will change in the near term due to one or more of the following: actual Enable cash distribution is materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in Enable’s operating environment, decline in Enable’s common unit price, increase in the discount rate, and changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and/or are forward looking in nature. Further declines in the fair value of Enable could result in additional impairments. CenterPoint Energy did not identify a decrease in value as of December 31, 2020, and no impairments in its investment in Enable were recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2020.
For further information, see Notes 11 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition Accounting
The Registrants evaluate acquisitions to determine when a set of acquired activities and assets represent a business. When control of a business is obtained, the Registrants apply the acquisition method of accounting and record the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest obtained based on fair value at the acquisition date.
The fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting provisions and earning a regulated return generally approximate their carrying values. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, are determined using the income and market approach, which estimation methods may require the use of significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income beginning on the date of the acquisition.
On the Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash. The Merger is being accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, with CenterPoint Energy as the accounting acquirer of Vectren. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values on the Merger Date.
Vectren’s regulated operations, comprised of electric generation and electric and natural gas delivery services, are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, the IURC and the PUCO, and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost-recovery provisions currently in place for Vectren’s regulated operations provide revenues designed to recover the cost of providing utility service and a return on and recovery of investment in rate base assets and liabilities. Thus, the fair values of Vectren’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximate their carrying values. Accordingly, neither the assets nor liabilities acquired reflect any adjustments related to these amounts. The fair value of regulatory assets not earning a return have been determined using the income approach and include the use of significant judgment and unobservable inputs.
The fair value of Vectren’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, and the allocation of fair value to reporting units on the Merger Date was determined under the income approach using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow income approach, and for the measurement of certain assets and liabilities, the market approach was utilized.
Fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses required the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which included expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the Merger Date. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of the identified
intangible assets and/or the resulting amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit. CenterPoint Energy utilized a third-party valuation specialist in determining the key assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets acquired and the allocation of goodwill to each of its reporting units on the Merger Date.
For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Unbilled Revenues
Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through AMS meter communications or manual readings. At the end of each month, deliveries to non-AMS customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Information regarding deliveries to AMS customers after the last billing is obtained from actual AMS meter usage data. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual AMS meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
Pension and Other Retirement Plans
CenterPoint Energy sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. CenterPoint Energy uses several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to its plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, CenterPoint Energy’s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other retirement plans expense recorded. Please read “- Other Significant Matters - Pension Plans” for further discussion.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 2(u) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect the Registrants.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS
Pension Plans (CenterPoint Energy). As discussed in Note 8(b) to the consolidated financial statements, CenterPoint Energy maintains non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plans are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.
Under the terms of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. CenterPoint Energy’s funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA.
Additionally, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the non-contributory qualified pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated.
CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements and employer contributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a minimum of approximately $53 million to the qualified pension plans and contributions aggregating approximately $8 million to the non-qualified benefit restoration plans in 2021.
Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.
As the sponsor of a plan, CenterPoint Energy is required to (a) recognize on its Consolidated Balance Sheet an asset for the plan’s over-funded status or a liability for the plan’s under-funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and, when related to its rate-regulated utilities with recoverability of cost, to regulatory assets.
The projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans by $372 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2021 could materially, positively or negatively, change the funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions.
Houston Electric and CERC participate in CenterPoint Energy’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees. Pension cost by Registrant were as follows:
The calculation of pension cost and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.
As of December 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy’s qualified pension plans had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.00%, which is 0.75% lower than the 5.75% rate assumed as of December 31, 2019. The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. CenterPoint Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.
As of December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 2.45%, which is 0.75% lower than the 3.20% discount rate assumed as of December 31, 2019. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of CenterPoint Energy’s plans.
CenterPoint Energy’s actuarially determined pension and other postemployment cost for 2020 and 2019 that is greater or less than the amounts being recovered through rates in the majority of Texas jurisdictions is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively. Pension cost for 2021, including the nonqualified benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $32 million before applicable regulatory deferrals and capitalization, based on an expected return on plan assets of 5.00% and a discount rate of 2.45% as of December 31, 2020. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 5.00% to 4.50%, 2021 pension cost would increase by approximately $10 million.
As of December 31, 2020, the pension plans projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded nonqualified pension plans, exceeded plan assets by $372 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 2.45% to 1.95%, the assumption change would increase CenterPoint Energy’s projected benefit obligation by approximately $145 million and decrease its 2021 pension cost by approximately $4 million. The expected reduction in pension cost due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. In addition, the assumption change would impact CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2020 by $124 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2020 of $17 million, net of tax of $4 million, due to the increase in the projected benefit obligation.
Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact CenterPoint Energy’s future pension expense and liabilities. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.
