Business Overview
Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the “Company”) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy, biofuels, and bioplastics technologies sectors.
In January 2018, the Company’s technology experts developed a technology system it calls Cellulose-to-Sugar or CTS 2.0, and a patent application was filed. CTS 2.0 is a mechanical/chemical dry process for converting cellulose material into sugar for use in the biofuels industry. CTS 2.0 can convert virtually any cellulosic material - like grasses, wood, paper, farm waste, yard waste, forestry products, energy crops like hemp or King Grass, and the cellulosic portion of municipal solid waste - into sugars and subsequently into biofuels and bioplastics without the use of enzymes or liquid acids. CTS 2.0 has a near zero carbon footprint, recycles the water and catalyst, and uses no enzymes, expensive chemicals, or strong acids. At commercial scale, management expects to be able to produce ethanol at a lower cost than any competitor due to the fact that the CTS 2.0 process is uncomplicated and efficient, and that it uses low cost feedstock as compared to corn.
The new technology made it worthwhile to financially restructure the Company through Chapter 11. The Company voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 on October 22, 2018, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida. Management fought and eliminated millions in debts and disputed debts, and the Company exited Chapter 11 on September 18, 2019, while keeping all classes, including shareholders, unimpaired. Having paid all debts that needed to be paid, the bankruptcy case was closed on October 25, 2019. Fresh Start accounting is not being applied because existing voting shares immediately before Plan Confirmation were not less than 50 percent of the voting shares of the emerging entity.
The Company completed its 4th generation CTS 2.0 prototype system in July 2020, and has upgraded that later in 2020. The upgraded 4th generation prototype system is currently being tested to optimize various parameters towards the engineering and scale up to a commercial size reactor.
Plan of Operation
The Company’s goal is to develop this CTS 2.0 technology to a commercial scale and then seek to either joint venture or acquire existing bioenergy and ethanol plants to install the CTS technology. To minimize dilution to shareholders, the Company will seek project-based financing to build (or acquire and retrofit) or joint venture with existing ethanol producers to produce cellulosic ethanol and lignin/bioplastics from its patented CTS 2.0 system. Retrofitting existing plants with the CTS 2.0 technology may achieve more rapid commercialization than building new plants. Once the first plant is profitable, the Company intends to grow with additional plants both in the United States and internationally.
Currently, the US government gives a D3 RIN to incentivize the production of renewable fuels from cellulosic materials. The value of the D3 RIN fluctuates, but as of this filing, it is around $2.60 per gallon of ethanol on top of the market price of ethanol.
The Company believes that its CTS 2.0 process can produce ethanol profitably at the market price, and with the D3 RIN should generate substantial profits and cash flow in amounts sufficient to cover the Company’s operating expenses and debt service.
The Company has a strategy that includes using its low-cost high-purity lignin co-product to produce biodegradable bioplastics. The Company has also licensed the Vertimass Process to convert ethanol (from the CTS 2.0 process) into bio-jet fuel.
The Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the development of technologies from concept to commercialization. As of this date, the Company has generated $194,319 in revenue, however it has not generated any revenues from its core business.
Capital Formation
From December 2019 through March 2020, the Company issued 6,500,000 shares to an insider and a former insider at a price of $0.05 per share for total aggregate proceeds of $325,000.
From May 2020 through January 5, 2021, the Company issued 10,201,794 shares at prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 9 cents per share, for proceeds of $773,130.
From July 10, 2020 through the end of 2020, 6,639,344 warrants were exercised for proceeds of $350,000.
From January 1, 2021, through the date of filing, 13,655,009 warrants were exercised for proceeds of $1,302,817.
From January 20, 2021, through the date of filing, the Company issued 7,100,000 shares at a price of $0.25 per share for proceeds of $1,775,000.
From January 1, 2021, through the date of filing, 350,000 options were exercised for proceeds of $12,900.
From January 1, 2020 through the date of filing, the Company issued an aggregate of 956,130 shares of its common stock for services valued at $84,430.
From January 1, 2020 through the date of filing, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,166,667 warrants for services. Using a Black-Scholes asset-pricing model, these warrants were valued at $72,090. These warrant agreements have terms of one year with an exercise price of $0.15 per share.
From January 1, 2020 through the date of filing, the aggregate number of options the Company issued to its employees, consultants, and independent directors, including cancellations, is 39,180,000. The number of vested options that remain are 12,167,099 with exercise prices ranging from $0.042 to $0.45 and terms range from five (5) to ten (10) years. 31,770,000 options vest over the next 5 years or upon the commercialization of the CTS 2.0 technology or other performance objectives.
Purchases of Equity Securities
The Company has never purchased, nor does it own, any equity securities of any other issuer.
Going Concern
The Company has incurred losses since inception, has a working capital deficiency, and may be unable to raise further capital. At December 31, 2020 the Company had a working capital deficiency of $766,555 and had incurred accumulated losses of $46,682,093 since its inception. The Company expects to incur significant additional losses in connection with its continued start-up activities. As disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and its need to obtain additional financing to sustain operations. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to pay its operating expenses.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $0 in revenue as opposed to $60,000 in 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s general and administrative expenses increased by $188,962 to $1,227,776 from $1,038,814 in 2019. This increase is primarily due to non-cash options packages valued at $876,291 in 2020 as compared to $294,846 non-cash stock compensation in 2019.
Interest expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 by $190,192 from $0 in 2019. This increase is due to the Company’s decision to accrue interest on the back pay due to management.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a gain of $0 from the extinguishment of debt as compared to $2,125,250 in 2019. The gain in 2019 was attributed to the cancellation of debts during Chapter 11.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a gain of $0 from derivative liabilities as compared to a gain of $656,533 in 2019. The gain in 2019 was attributed to the cancellation of debts during Chapter 11.
Research and Development
The Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the amounts charged to research and development expenses were $763,159 and $797,862, respectively.
The reduction is due to conserving resources during the COVID pandemic.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020 the Company had $286,579 in cash and total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was negative $3,336,764. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $110,630 in cash and total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2019 was negative $3,331,809. Total debt, including advances, accounts payable and other notes payable at December 31, 2020, together with interest payable thereon and contingent liabilities, was $4,229,266 an increase of $287,871 from December 31, 2019, where it stood at $3,941,395. This increase is primarily attributable to interest payable to related parties and a paycheck protection program loan from the SBA. $2,942,132 of the remaining debt was renegotiated to be payable out of future revenue or future profits and otherwise does not come due.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s operating expenses increased $154,259 to $1,990,935 from $1,836,676 in 2019. This increase can primarily be attributed to an increase in non-cash options expense.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s investing activities used $206,315 in cash. This can be primarily attributed to $147,189 used to purchase machinery and equipment, and $59,126 in patent expenses.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated an aggregate of $1,303,710 through its financing activities, which is a decrease of $20,109 from $1,323,819 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease from the prior year can primarily be attributed to an overall slowdown in capital raising due to COVID-19, partially offset by a $66,330 paycheck protection program loan. There was an increase of proceeds of $350,000 from the exercise of warrants from $0 in 2019, offset by a reduction of $289,000 from the issuance of stock and a $100,000 reduction to $0 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible debts.
Capital Resources
At this time, the Company has limited liquidity and capital resources. To continue funding its operations, the Company will need to generate revenue or obtain additional financing for current and future operations. The Company anticipates needing around $10 million to optimize and scale up its CTS 2.0 system to be commercially ready. The Company anticipates reaching this stage around 18 months after financing. Although some of the financing has come in in 2021, there is no guarantee that we will achieve all of the additional funding that is needed.
As of the date of filing, the Company has raised $3,001,467 in 2021, through the issuance of common stock and the exercise of warrants and options, in addition to $10,692,293 raised through the end of 2020 through its private placement offerings, and in addition to capital raised through debt or convertible notes. However, there is no guarantee that the company will be able to raise any additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company.
The inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to reevaluate and revise its operations.
Equity
As of December 31, 2020, shareholders’ equity was negative $(3,336,764).
There were 241,721,947 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
There were no preferred shares outstanding.
The Company has paid no dividends.
Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercised control, if any, and there are currently none.
Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its then-existing subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in business entities in which the Company lacks control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. The Company’s proportionate share of net income or loss of the entity is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates presented and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates of impairment assessment of identifiable intangible assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Estimates are based on past experience and other considerations reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Stock Compensation
The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based payments under the relevant authoritative accounting guidance. Share-based payments include any remuneration paid by the Company in shares of the Company’s common stock or financial instruments that grant the recipient the right to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock. For share-based payments to employees, which consist only of awards made under the stock option plan described below, the Company accounts for the payments in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Stock Compensation” (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)). Share-based payments to consultants, service providers and other non-employees are accounted for under in accordance with ASC Topic 718, ASC Topic 505, “Equity Payments to Non-Employees” or other applicable authoritative guidance
Convertible Instruments
The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging Activities”.
Applicable GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.
The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) that are not in default as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption. Notes that are in default are accounted for at the stated default dollar amount, even when the Company deems all or a portion of such Notes to be in dispute.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
The Company does not have debentures at this time. The Company issues debentures where the number of shares into which a debenture can be converted is not fixed. For example, when a debenture converts at a discount to market based on the stock price on the date of conversion. In such instances, the embedded conversion option of the convertible debentures is bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at their fair value. In accounting for derivatives, the Company records a liability representing the estimated present value of the conversion feature considering the historic volatility of the Company’s stock, and a discount representing the imputed interest associated with the beneficial conversion feature. The discount is then amortized over the life of the debenture and the derivative liability is adjusted periodically according to stock price fluctuations. At the time of conversion, any remaining derivative liability is charged to additional paid-in capital. For purposes of determining derivative liability, the Company uses Black-Scholes modeling for computing historic volatility.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company’s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows when implemented.
Seasonality
The Company’s operating results are not affected by seasonality.
Inflation
The Company’s business and operating results are not currently affected in any material way by inflation.
Contractual Obligations
As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
