Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Management's Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to provide an understanding of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
Overview
General
Unico American Corporation is an insurance holding company. Currently, the Company’s subsidiary Crusader Insurance Company (“Crusader”) underwrites commercial property and casualty insurance, the Company’s subsidiaries Unifax Insurance Systems, Inc. (“Unifax”) and American Insurance Brokers, Inc. (“AIB”) provide marketing and various underwriting support services related to property, casualty, health and life insurance, the Company’s subsidiary American Acceptance Company (“AAC”) provides insurance premium financing, and the Company’s subsidiary Insurance Club, Inc., dba AAQHC, an Administrator (“AAQHC”) provides membership association services.
Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $32,560,111 compared to $31,372,814 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,187,297. The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21,491,113 compared to net loss of $3,115,703 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Repeated and sustained underwriting losses in Crusader’s Apartments & Commercial Buildings vertical and growth in the Transportation vertical, a product which is generally known for its difficulty to be underwritten profitably, coupled with changes in market conditions, caused Crusader’s management to reevaluate the assumptions used in its process for estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. This reevaluation resulted in a $9,399,547 increase in Crusader’s IBNR reserves, net of reinsurance, which was a primary contributor to the $12,066,793 increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $34,642,920 recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $22,576,127 recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Another significant contributor to the Company’s increased net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an increase in income tax expense of $3,681,785 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets on federal net operating losses.
This overview discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the Company's performance, prospects and risks. It is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of the MD&A, the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and all other items contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As a result of the ongoing coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, economic uncertainties have arisen, which negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the fair value of investments, day to day administration of the Company’s business and the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
The effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were a major contributor to the variability in fair value of the Company’s fixed income and equity investments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may lead to further investment valuation volatility. In addition, the recent decline in investment yields resulted in lower reinvestment rates, compared to the previous years, which will cap the Company’s investment portfolio’s ability to generate higher levels of investment income, absent a larger invested asset base or a change in investment philosophy.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on Crusader’s overall gross written premium (direct and assumed written premium before cessions to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, Crusader has experienced a decrease in new business submissions and renewals related to the pandemic in its Bars/Taverns market sector niche as a result of government regulations, such as shelter-in-place orders and in-door dining limitations, which had adversely impacted the gross written premium for that niche.
Crusader has received a number of coronavirus-related business interruption claims. While the Company does not believe it is exposed to substantial risk from those claims under the insurance policies written by Crusader, the individual circumstances of each such claim are reviewed to fulfill Crusader’s obligation to its policyholders if coverage applies. Further, there may be impacts to the timing of loss emergence and ultimate loss ratios for certain of Crusader’s products due to postponements of civil court cases, extensions of various statutes of limitations, changes in settlement trends and other new legislative, regulatory or judicial developments, which could result in loss reserve deficiencies and negative impact on results of operations.
The Company’s financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, do not fully reflect the potential adverse impacts that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has had or will have on its business due to a high degree of uncertainty around this relatively new and continuously evolving environment. The financial impact of these uncertainties is unknown at this time but could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
While the coronavirus pandemic is also affecting the Company’s internal operations, the Company implemented a plan at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to help its operations continue effectively during the ongoing pandemic, including processes to limit the spread of COVID-19 among employees. For example, the Company modified its business practices in accordance with social distancing and safety guidelines, allowing many employees work-from-home arrangements, flexible work schedules, and restricted business travel. The Company’s employees are following the guidelines and approximately 75% are working from their homes. The Company will follow governmental safety guidelines to determine when to remove the coronavirus-related business restrictions and to allow employees working from home to return to the workplace. At this point, the Company does not have an estimate on when these changes will occur. While the pandemic has created new challenges for the Company, the Company’s ability to maintain its operations, internal controls and relationships has not been adversely affected.
The Company’s financial performance suffered in recent years, reporting net losses for each fiscal year beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015. While losses in recent years have been driven primarily by losses from Crusader’s policies and their high loss ratios, management believes that other contributing factors include (1) the growth of some of the Company’s non-routine expenses relative to flat or declining revenues, (2) the failure to replace or upgrade the Company’s legacy IT system in order to process Crusader’s smaller premium accounts more efficiently, and (3) the failure to shift focus to larger premium accounts and fee-for-service operations.
In light of the challenges faced and operational results, the Company has taken several steps to improve its results. To improve Crusader's loss ratios, beginning in January 2017, the Company made significant changes in its staffing and in its pricing and risk selection practices. To improve revenues the Company is working to improve its sales in the markets that it has historically served, to gain access to markets that it has not previously served, and to generate new sources of revenue on a fee-for-service basis. For example, the Company also re-activated its U.S. Risk Managers, Inc. subsidiary so that it can provide claims adjustment services to non-affiliated insurers and to self-insurers on a fee-for-service basis (i.e., where Crusader will not be underwriting the risk), providing the potential for an alternative revenue source to the Company.
On April 1, 2020, Crusader and Unifax, entered into a reinsurance arrangement with United Specialty Insurance Company (“USIC”), pursuant to which USIC would underwrite property and casualty insurance policies by and through Unifax and such policies would be reinsured by Crusader. On September 2, 2020, the Company placed a moratorium on placing any new risks with USIC by Unifax pending negotiations among Crusader, Unifax, and USIC pursuant to the issues raised by the DOI regarding the structure of the reinsurance arrangement and its compliance with the California Insurance Holding Company System Act (the “Insurance Act”).
31 of 95
On November 24, 2020, as a result of such negotiations with the DOI, Crusader, Unifax and USIC agreed to rescind certain agreements by and among USIC, Crusader and Unifax. The effect of such rescissions was that the rescinded agreements were deemed never to have existed and no insurance policies were deemed issued, and no premium deemed written, collected or reported with respect to those agreements. Further, on November 24, 2020, the parties entered into various restructured arrangements in order to address the issues raised by the DOI with respect to California insurance laws. In particular, the parties eliminated all intercompany duties so that the arrangement would not require prior approval by the DOI under the Insurance Act. Details of the restructured arrangements with USIC include the following:
On November 24, 2020, USIC and Crusader entered into a new Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement, effective April 1, 2020, (the “New Reinsurance Agreement”), pursuant to which Crusader will reinsure all of USIC’s liability for policies issued by USIC and produced by Unifax for property, general liability, CMP property, CMP liability and other miscellaneous coverages, subject to certain maximum policy limits. Policies placed with USIC by Unifax and reinsured with Crusader prior to November 24, 2020 remain in place without interruption or change and are subject to the New Reinsurance Agreement.
On November 24, 2020, USIC and Unifax entered into a Surplus Line Broker Agreement, effective April 1, 2020 (the “Broker Agreement”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth therein, USIC authorized Unifax to act as its broker and agent for the purpose of producing and administering certain specified classes of insurance policies, which are the subject of the New Reinsurance Agreement. Under the Broker Agreement, Unifax is entitled to retain a commission for policies produced based on a percentage of the premiums on business placed with USIC. Unifax has agreed to indemnify and hold USIC harmless from any losses relating to the Broker Agreement. The Broker Agreement may be terminated in specified events, including by any party upon 90 days written notice to the other parties and automatically upon cancellation or termination of the New Reinsurance Agreement.
On November 24, 2020, USIC and U.S. Risk Managers, Inc. (“U.S. Risk”) entered into a Claims Administration Agreement, effective as of April 1, 2020 (the “Claims Administration Agreement”). Pursuant to the Claims Administration Agreement, USIC appointed U.S. Risk, which is a licensed claims adjuster in the state of California, to adjust and settle claims on its behalf in connection with the surplus lines policies issued by USIC in connection with the New Reinsurance Agreement. U.S. Risk will be paid a fee by Unifax on behalf of USIC based on a percentage of earned premium. U.S. Risk will establish an account for payment of claims by U.S. Risk (the “Loss Fund Account”) pursuant to the Claims Administration Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the New Reinsurance Agreement, Crusader will fund the Loss Fund Account provided for in the Claims Administration Agreement on behalf of USIC.U.S. Risk has agreed to indemnify and hold USIC harmless from any losses relating to the Claims Administration Agreement. The Claims Administration Agreement may be terminated in specified events, including by any party upon 90 days written notice to the other parties and automatically upon cancellation or termination of the Broker Agreement.
In 2018, the Company determined that the cost to replace its legacy IT system would be between $4,000,000 and $8,000,000, and the installation of such a system would take between two to four years. After weighing the time and expense involved against the anticipated benefit from such an investment, the Company opted for what it then perceived to be a less expensive upgrade to its legacy system, an upgrade that then seemed to offer more incremental benefits in a shorter timeframe. While initially expected to be completed by the end of 2019, at a cost of approximately $300,000, excluding costs of Unico’s employees involved in the upgrade, the system upgrade is now expected to be completed by the end of first quarter of 2021 at a cost not to exceed $1,500,000, excluding costs of Unico’s employees involved in the upgrade, due to unexpected technical challenges. In light of the significant delays and increases in cost associated with its legacy upgrade project, the Company has deployed additional resources toward the management of this project and has renegotiated the relationship that it has with the non-affiliated vendor working on this project.
Revenue and Income Generation
The Company receives its revenues primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operation, commission and fee income generated from the insurance agency operations, finance fee income from the premium finance operations, and investment income from cash generated primarily from the insurance company operation. The insurance company operation generated approximately 94% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. None of the Company’s other operations is individually material to consolidated revenues.

Insurance Company Operation
As of December 31, 2020, Crusader was licensed as an admitted insurance carrier in the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. From 2004 until June 2014, all of Crusader’s business was written in the state of California. Crusader’s business remains concentrated in California (99.9% of gross written premium, which represents written premium before cession to reinsurers, in the years ended 2020 and 2019)). During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 99.6% and 98.3% of Crusader’s business was CMP policies, respectively.
Crusader’s total gross written premium (direct and assumed written premium before cessions to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties), as reported on Crusader’s statutory financial statements, was produced geographically as follows:
Crusader believes that it can grow its sales and profitability through improved specialization and sales incentives. Crusader currently focuses in four underwriting verticals: (1) Transportation, (2) Food, Beverage & Entertainment, (3) Garage & Mercantile, and (4) Apartments & Commercial Buildings. Crusader also is evaluating the possibility of expanding its operations geographically, on an admitted or non-admitted basis, so as to offer similar products in other states, but the timing of any such expansion is not yet determined.
Written premium is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined, under SAP, as the contractually determined amount charged by the insurance company to the policyholder for the effective period of the contract based on the expectation of risk, policy benefits, and expenses associated with the coverage provided by the terms of the policies. Written premium is a required statutory measure. Written premium is defined under GAAP in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 405, “Liabilities,” as “premiums on all policies an entity has issued in a period.” Earned premium, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to written premium, represents the portion of written premium that is recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Written premium is intended to reflect production levels and is meant as supplemental information and not intended to replace earned premium. Such information should be read in connection with the Company’s GAAP financial results.
The following is a reconciliation of gross written premium (direct and assumed written premium before cessions to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties) to net earned premium (after premium ceded to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties):
The insurance company operation’s underwriting profitability is defined by pre-tax underwriting gain or loss which is calculated as net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs.
33 of 95
Crusader’s underwriting loss before income taxes is as follows:
Underwriting gain or loss before income taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure. Underwriting gain or loss before income taxes represents one measure of the pretax profitability of the insurance company operation and is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expenses, and policy acquisition costs from net earned premium, which are all GAAP financial measures. Management believes disclosure of underwriting profit or loss before income taxes is useful supplemental information that helps align the reader’s understanding with management’s view of insurance company operations profitability. Each of these captions is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations but is not subtotaled.
The following is a reconciliation of Crusader’s underwriting loss before income taxes to the Company’s loss before taxes:
Unearned premiums represent premium applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. The Company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs, unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs, and maintenance costs partially offset by net investment income to related unearned premiums. To the extent that any of the Company’s programs become unprofitable, a premium deficiency reserve may be required. The Company recognized a premium deficiency of $150,000 as of December 31, 2020. The Company did not carry a premium deficiency reserve as of December 31, 2019. The premium deficiency was recorded as a reduction in deferred policy acquisition costs.
The insurance company operation combined ratio is the sum of (1) the ratio of net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred (including a provision for IBNR) to net earned premium (loss ratio) and (2) the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net earned premium (expense ratio). If the combined ratio is below 100%, an insurance company has an underwriting profit; if it is above 100%, the company has an underwriting loss.
34 of 95
The following table shows the loss ratios, expense ratios, and combined ratios of Crusader:
(1) Loss ratio is defined as losses and loss adjustment expenses divided by net earned premium.
(2) Expense ratio is defined as a sum of policy acquisition costs and portions of indirect salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses allocation to the insurance company operations, reduced by allocation of gross commissions and fees and other income, divided by net earned premium.
(3) Combined ratio is defined as a sum of loss ratio and expense ratio.
The following table provides an analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses:
On February 5, 2021, A.M. Best Company revised the outlooks to negative from stable and affirmed the FSR of B++ (Good) and Long-Term ICR of “bbb” of Crusader. Additionally, A.M. Best has revised the outlook to negative from stable and affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bb” of the Company. Crusader is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
The negative outlooks capture A.M. Best’s concerns with Crusader’s declining underwriting performance, the Company’s overall capitalization and the execution risk associated with implementing strategic operating changes to address these conditions.
The Long-Term ICRs reflect Crusader’s balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as very strong, as well as its marginal operating performance, limited business profile and marginal enterprise risk management.
Some of Crusader’s policyholders, or the lenders, landlords or clients of Crusader’s policyholders, require insurance from a company that has an A.M. Best FSR of “A-” or higher, and the A.M. Best’s changed ratings of Crusader may also have a negative impact on Crusader’s reputation. Therefore, Crusader’s and Unico’s changed ratings may have a negative impact on the Company’s revenue and results of operations. The Company cannot quantify the impact that the rating changes have had or will have on its revenue and results of operations, and the Company cannot determine if or when Crusader might regain the “A-” FSR from A.M. Best.
The reinsurance arrangement with USIC allows Unifax to offer its customers policies written on USIC paper, which has A.M. Best FSR of “A,” when such rating is required.
The property and casualty insurance business is cyclical in nature. The conditions of a “soft market” include premium rates that are stable or falling and insurance is readily available. Contrarily, “hard market” conditions occur during periods in which premium rates rise and coverage may be more difficult to find. The Company believes that the California property and casualty insurance market is relatively mature and intensely competitive, with different products in different stages of the soft/hard market cycle at any given time.
Other Insurance Operations
The Company’s revenues from other insurance operations consist of commissions, fees, investment and other income. Excluding investment and other income, these operations accounted for approximately 6% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
35 of 95
Investments
The Company generated revenues from its total invested assets of $83,617,720 (fixed maturities at amortized cost, equity securities at cost and short-term investments at fair value) and $84,997,226 (fixed maturities at amortized cost and short-term investments at fair value) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net investment income (net of investment expenses) decreased $109,699 (5%) for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in net investment income was due primarily to decrease in the average invested assets.
Due to the current interest rate environment, the current target effective duration for the Company’s investment portfolio is between 2.0 and 4.0 years. As of December 31, 2020, all of the Company’s investments are in U.S. Treasury securities, corporate fixed maturity securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, equity securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured certificates of deposit, and short-term investments. All of the Company’s investments, except for the certificates of deposit, are readily marketable. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average maturity of the Company’s investments was approximately 8.0 years, and the effective duration for available-for-sale investments (investments managed under the investment guidelines) was 2.9 years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The most significant liquidity risk faced by the Company is adverse development of the insurance company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Based on the Company’s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments, the Company believes that there are no current liquidity issues. However, no assurance can be given that the Company’s estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense reserves will be sufficient.
Crusader has a significant amount of cash, cash equivalents and investments as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves, its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense payments and its capital and surplus. Crusader's loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the Company. These payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the Company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments (at amortized cost) of the Company at December 31, 2020, were $87,575,700 compared to $90,778,865 at December 31, 2019. Crusader's cash, cash equivalents, and investments were 98% and 99% of the total cash, cash equivalents, and investments (at amortized cost) held by the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, all of the Company’s investments are in U.S. Treasury securities, FDIC insured certificates of deposit, corporate fixed maturity securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, equity securities and short-term investments. All of the Company’s investments except for the certificates of deposit, are readily marketable.
The composition of Company’s investment portfolio is as follows:
36 of 95
The short-term investments include U.S. Treasury bills and certificates of deposit that are all highly rated and have initial maturities between three and twelve months. Amortized costs of the short-term investments approximate their fair values.
The Company is required to classify its debt securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading securities. Although part of the Company's investments in fixed maturity securities is classified as available-for-sale and, while the Company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic, regulatory and market conditions, its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high-quality investments to maturity.
The Company’s Board of Directors has approved investment guidelines which reflect the Company’s risk, balance sheet, and profile.
Under the Company’s investment guidelines, investments may only include U.S. Treasury notes, U.S. government agency notes, mortgage-backed securities (including pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations) that are backed by agency and non-agency collateral, commercial mortgage-backed securities, U.S. corporate obligations, asset backed securities (including but not limited to credit card, automobile and home equity backed securities), tax-exempt bonds, preferred stocks, common stocks, commercial paper, repurchase agreements (treasuries only), mutual funds, exchange traded funds, bank certificates of deposits and time deposits. The investment guidelines provide for certain investment limitations in each investment category.
Unless agreed to in advance in writing by Crusader, investments in the following types of securities are prohibited:
•
Mortgage loans, except for mortgage backed securities issued by an agency of the U.S. government.
•
Derivative mortgage-backed securities including interest only, principal only and inverse floating rate securities.
•
All fixed maturity real estate securities, except mortgage-backed securities (including pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations) that are backed by agency and non-agency collateral and commercial mortgage-backed securities.
•
Options and futures contracts.
•
All non-U.S. dollar denominated securities.
•
Any security that would not be in compliance with the regulations of Crusader’s state of domicile.
An independent investment advisor manages Crusader’s investments. The advisor’s role currently is limited to maintaining Crusader’s portfolio within the investment guidelines and providing investment accounting services to the Company. Primarily all investments continue to be held by Crusader’s current custodian, Union Bank Global Custody Services.
As of December 31, 2020, one corporate security, included in available-for-sale fixed maturities, was held as collateral with Comerica Bank & Trust, N. A. (“Comerica”), pursuant to the reinsurance trust agreement among Crusader, USIC and Comerica to secure payment of Crusader’s liabilities and performance of its obligations under the reinsurance arrangement with USIC. The estimated fair value and amortized cost of that security was $824,500 and $787,653 on December 31, 2020, respectively.
On August 10, 2020, the Board authorized a share repurchase program (the “2020 Program”) for up to $5,000,000 of the currently outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. The 2020 Program is effective immediately and replaces the Company’s existing share repurchase program that was adopted by the Board on December 19, 2008 (the “2008 Program”) to acquire from time to time up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The purchases under the 2020 Program may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades, 10b5-1 trading plans, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The timing and actual number of the shares repurchased under the 2020 Program will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions and corporate and regulatory requirements. The Company intends to fund the share repurchases under the 2020 Program from cash on hand. The 2020 Program does not commit the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock and it may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company repurchased its shares under the 2020 Program and 2008 Program in unsolicited transactions as follows:
37 of 95
The Company has remaining authority under the 2020 Program to repurchase up to $4,995,507 of the currently outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2020. The Company has retired or will retire all stock repurchased under the 2020 Program and 2008 Program.
The Company reported net cash used by operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Cash used by operating activities in 2020 was $2,436,399 compared to $3,163,210 in 2019. Fluctuations in cash flows from operating activities relate to changes in loss and loss adjustment expense payments, unearned premium holdings, and the timing of the collection and the payment of insurance-related receivables and payables. Although the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect net cash used by operating activities, the Company does not anticipate future liquidity problems, and the Company believes it continues to be well capitalized and adequately reserved.
While material capital expenditures may be funded through borrowings, the Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at December 31, 2020, net of statutory deposits of $710,000 and California insurance company statutory dividend restrictions applicable to Crusader plus the cash to be generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next 12 months without the necessity of borrowing funds.
Crusader's statutory capital and surplus as of December 31, 2020, was $26,893,515, a decrease of $19,605,445 (42%) from December 31, 2019. On each of September 14, 2020, and May 20, 2020, Crusader paid cash dividends of $2,000,000 to Unico, its parent and sole shareholder. These two dividends totaling $4,000,000 were used primarily for general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Crusader issued cash dividends of $2,000,000 to Unico, its parent and sole shareholder. Based on Crusader’s statutory surplus for the year ended December 31, 2020, the maximum aggregate dividend that could be made by Crusader to Unico without prior regulatory approval in 2021 is $2,689,352.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no cash dividends were declared or issued by the Company to its shareholders. Declaration of future cash dividends, if any, will be subject to the Company’s profitability, cash requirements, capital requirements, and general business conditions, among other factors.
As a California insurance company, Crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross written premium in all states that Crusader is admitted. Premium taxes are deferred and amortized as the related premium is earned. The premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the provision for state taxes.
Results of Operations
General
Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $32,560,111, an increase of $1,187,297 (4%) compared to $31,372,814 for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had loss before taxes of $17,943,515 compared to loss before taxes of $3,249,890 for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had net loss of $21,491,113 compared to net loss of $3,115,703 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
38 of 95
The increase in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due primarily to an increase in net earned premium of $1,430,700 (5%).
The increase in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due primarily to an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $12,066,793 (53%), increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2,296,318 (56%), an increase in other operating expenses of $1,658,331 (58%), and an increase in income tax expense of $3,681,785 (2744%), partially offset by the increase in net earned premium.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company reevaluated certain assumptions used in its process for estimating loss and loss adjustment reserves due to its experiences in Crusader’s Apartments & Commercial Buildings and Transportation verticals as well as changes in market conditions. This reevaluation resulted in a $9,399,547 increase in Crusader’s IBNR reserves, net of reinsurance, which was a primary contributor to the increase of $12,066,793 in losses and loss adjustment expenses from $22,576,127 recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to $34,642,920 recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
The increase in salaries and employee benefits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 of $2,296,318 was due primarily to costs associated with a termination of an employment agreement with an executive, increases in executive compensation, increases in employee benefits due to higher medical insurance rates, and vacation accruals due to less vacation taken by the employees as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The increase in other operating expenses of $1,658,331 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was due primarily to increases in legal, depreciation and communication expenses, fees associated with the reinsurance arrangement with USIC, and higher board of director fees.
The increase in income tax expense of $3,681,785 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets on federal net operating losses.
The effect of inflation on the Company’s net loss during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was not significant.
Revenues
Crusader Premium
Crusader’s primary lines of business are written on Commercial Multi Peril policies. These policies represented approximately 99.6% and 98.3% of Crusader’s total written premium for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Gross written premium (direct and assumed written premium before cessions to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties) reported on Crusader’s statutory financial statements increased $838,880 (2%) to $36,642,830 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $35,803,950 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in gross written premium for the year ended December 31, 2020, was due primarily to growth in the Company’s Transportation vertical, transacted by Crusader. The Transportation vertical transacts insurance primarily for long-haul trucking operations that are domiciled in California. The growth in the Company’s Transportation vertical was partially offset by coronavirus-related contraction in the Food, Beverage & Entertainment underwriting vertical for Crusader.
Although the ongoing coronavirus pandemic did not have a significant impact on Crusader’s overall gross written premium (direct and assumed written premium before cessions to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties) during the year ended December 31, 2020, Crusader has experienced a decrease in new business submissions and renewals related to the pandemic in its Bars/Taverns market sector niche as a result of government regulations, such as shelter-in-place orders and in-door dining limitations, which had adversely impacted the gross written premium for that niche.
Written premium
Written premium is a required statutory measure. Written premium is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined, under SAP, as the contractually determined amount charged by the insurance company to the policyholder for the effective period of the contract based on the expectation of risk, policy benefits, and expenses associated with the coverage provided by the terms of the policies.
39 of 95
Written premium is defined under GAAP in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 405, “Liabilities,” as “premiums on all policies an entity has issued in a period.” Earned premium, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to written premium, represents the portion of written premium that is recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Written premium is intended to reflect production levels and is meant as supplemental information and not intended to replace earned premium. Such information should be read in connection with the Company’s GAAP financial results.
Gross earned premium
Gross earned premium (direct and assumed earned premium before cessions to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties) increased $2,306,667 (7%) to $36,264,869 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $33,958,202 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company writes annual policies. Earned premium represents a portion of written premium that is recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned daily on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies, and, therefore, premiums earned in the current year are related to policies written during both the current year and immediately preceding year. The increase in gross earned premium for the year ended December 31, 2020, was due primarily to an increase in gross written premium in 2019.
Ceded earned premium
Ceded earned premium (premium ceded to reinsurers under reinsurance treaties) increased $875,967 (12%) to $8,096,701 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7,220,734 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Ceded earned premium as a percentage of gross earned premium was 22% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 21% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the ceded earned premium as a percentage of gross earned premium for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due primarily to higher gross earned premium subject to reinsurance treaties and higher rates on excess of loss reinsurance treaties.
Reinsurance treaties are generally structured in layers, with different negotiated economic terms and retention of participation, or liability, in each layer. In calendar years 2020 and 2019, Crusader retained participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 0% in its 1st layer (reinsured losses between $500,000 and $1,000,000), 0% in its 2nd layer (reinsured losses between $1,000,000 and $4,000,000), and 0% in its property and casualty clash treaty.
Crusader also has catastrophe reinsurance treaties from various highly rated California authorized and California unauthorized reinsurance companies. These reinsurance treaties help protect Crusader against losses in excess of certain retentions from catastrophic events that may occur on property risks which Crusader insures. In calendar years 2020 and 2019, Crusader retained a participation in its catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 5% in its 1st layer (reinsured losses between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000) and 0% in its 2nd layer (reinsured losses between $10,000,000 and $46,000,000).
Crusader evaluates each of its ceded reinsurance contracts at its inception to determine if there is a sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature. As of December 31, 2020, all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance.
A tabular presentation of Crusader’s direct, assumed, ceded and net earned premium is as follows:

Investment Income, Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses, and
Net Unrealized Investment Gains on Equity Securities
Net investment income decreased $109,699 (5%) to $1,988,243 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2,097,942 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in net investment income was due primarily to a decrease in average invested assets. The Company had net realized investment gains of $97,771 and net unrealized investment gains on equity securities of $198,266, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net realized investment losses of $12,661 and no net unrealized investment gains on equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net investment income, excluding net realized investment losses/gains, and yields on Company’s average invested assets are as follows:
(1) The average is based on the beginning and ending balances of the amortized cost of the invested assets for each respective year.
(2) Investment income from invested assets included $133,679 of investment expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $129,842 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
(3) Annualized yield on average invested assets did not include the investment income from cash equivalents.
The par value, amortized cost, estimated market value and weighted average yield of fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2020, by contractual maturity are as follows:
Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties.
The weighted average maturity of the Company’s investments was approximately 8.0 years as of December 31, 2020, and 7.7 years as of December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, all of the Company’s investments are in U.S. Treasury securities, FDIC insured certificates of deposit, corporate fixed maturity securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, equity securities and short-term investments. The investments in the certificates of deposit are classified as held-to-maturity investments, and all other fixed maturity investments are classified as available-for-sale. All of the Company’s investments, except for the certificates of deposit, are readily marketable. The following table sets forth the composition of the investment portfolio of the Company at the dates indicated:
41 of 95
A summary of estimated fair value and gross unrealized losses in a gross unrealized loss position by the length of time in which the securities have continually been in that position is shown below:
While the fair value of Company’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2020, has recovered from the declines recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2020, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic were a major contributor to the variability in fair value of the Company’s fixed income and equity investments during the year ended December 31, 2020, and the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may lead to further investment valuation volatility. In addition, the recent decline in investment yields resulted in lower reinvestment rates, compared to the previous years, which will cap the Company’s investment portfolio’s ability to generate higher levels of investment income, absent a larger invested asset base or a change in investment philosophy
The Company closely monitors its investments. If an unrealized loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, it is written off as a realized loss through the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s methodology of assessing other-than-temporary impairments is based on security-specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, one fixed maturity corporate security experienced a significant decline in market value; the market and book value of that security at December 31, 2020, was $867,375 and $910,893, respectively. The unrealized losses on all securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, were determined to be temporary.
42 of 95
Although the Company does not intend to sell its fixed maturity investments prior to maturity, the Company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to cash flow requirements, economic, regulatory, and/or market conditions or investment securities may be called by their issuers prior to the securities’ maturity. The fixed maturity securities previously held by the Company were sold and called prior to maturity as follows:
The unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities are reported as “Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss,” which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of any deferred tax effect.
Other Income
Other income included in insurance company operation and other insurance operations decreased $94,072 (70%) to $39,811 for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $133,883 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2020, is due primarily to decreases in rental income of $27,277 and Crusader’s share of California FAIR Plan Equity of $58,646.
Gross commissions and fees
Gross commissions and fees decreased $349,395 (16%) to $1,827,263 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2,176,658 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The comparison of gross commission and fees for the year ended December 31, 2020, to the year ended December 31, 2019, is as follows:
Unifax sells and services insurance policies for Crusader and USIC. For these brokerage services, Unifax receives commissions from insurance companies and fees from policyholders. The commissions paid by Crusader to Unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the consolidated financial statements. Policy fee income received by Unifax is related to the Crusader policies and service fee income received by Unifax is related to the USIC policies. For financial statement reporting purposes, brokerage fees are earned ratably over the life of the related insurance policy. The unearned portion of the brokerage fees is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under “Accrued expenses and other liabilities.” The earned portion of the brokerage fees charged to the policyholder by Unifax is recognized as income in the consolidated financial statements. Brokerage fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased $139,915 (12%) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in brokerage fee income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of a 826 (13%) decrease in the number of policies issued of 5,401 during 2020 compared to 6,227 policies issued during 2019.
43 of 95
AIB markets health insurance in California through non-affiliated insurance companies for individuals and groups. For these services, AIB receives commission based on the premium that it writes. Commission income for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased $212,174 (23%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in commission income is primarily a result of a loss of a large group account.
In 2020, approximately 30% and 56% of the commission income from health insurance sales was from Guardian Life Insurance Company of America dental and group life plan programs and the Blue Shield Care Trust health and life insurance programs, respectively. In 2019, approximately 39% and 49% of the commission income from health insurance sales was from Guardian Life Insurance Company of America dental and group life plan programs and the Blue Shield Care Trust health and life insurance programs, respectively.
AAQHC is a third party administrator for contracted insurance companies and is a membership association that provides various consumer benefits to its members, including participation in group health care insurance policies that AAQHC negotiates for the association. For these services, AAQHC receives membership and fee income from its members. Membership and fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased $2,694 (3%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is a result of an increase in administration fees.
Finance charges and fees earned
Finance charges and fees earned consist of finance charges, late fees, returned check fees and payment processing fees. These charges and fees earned by AAC increased $1,065 (0%) to $240,589 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $239,524 for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to the increase in earned finance charges as a result of the change in annual percentage rate charged on AAC new loans from a single fixed interest rate to a tiered interest rate structure effective April 1, 2019 offset by a decrease in number of polices financed. During the year ended December 31, 2020, AAC issued 1,111 loans and had 821 loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, AAC issued 1,547 loans and had 1,173 loans outstanding as of December 31, 2019. AAC provides premium financing only for Crusader and USIC policies produced by Unifax in California. The number of loans issued decreased by 436 (28%) during 2020 when compared to 2019. The average premium financed by AAC was $6,477 and $5,672 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020, 48% of all Unifax generated policies were financed and 43% of those policies were financed by AAC. During 2019, 44% of all Unifax generated policies were financed and 56% of those policies were financed by AAC.
Expenses
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Crusader’s emerging loss ratios for each accident year are reviewed in detail at the end of each quarter as part of the reserve review process. Losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $34,642,920 and $22,576,127, respectively. Loss ratio, which is calculated by dividing losses and loss adjustment expenses by net earned premium, was 123% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 85% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss ratios are as follows:
Some lines of insurance are commonly referred to as "long-tail" lines because of the extended time required before claims are ultimately settled. Lines of insurance in which claims are settled relatively quickly are called "short-tail" lines. It is generally more difficult to estimate loss reserves for long-tail lines because of the long period of time that elapses between the occurrence of a claim and its final disposition and the difficulty of estimating the settlement value of the claim. Crusader’s short-tail lines consist of its property coverages, and its long-tail lines consist of its liability coverages. However, Crusader’s long-tail liability claims tend to be settled relatively quicker than other long-tail lines not underwritten by Crusader, such as workers’ compensation, professional liability, umbrella liability, and medical malpractice. Since trends develop over longer periods of time on long-tail lines of business, the Company generally gives credibility to those trends more slowly than for short-tail or less volatile lines of business.

The difficulty in estimating the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves contributed to adverse development of insured events of prior years in the amount of $7,959,048 which Crusader experienced in 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company reevaluated certain assumptions used in its process for estimating loss and loss adjustment reserves due to its experiences in Crusader’s Apartments & Commercial Buildings and Transportation verticals as well as changes in market conditions. This reevaluation resulted in a $9,399,547 increase in Crusader’s IBNR reserves, net of reinsurance, which was a primary contributor to the increase of $12,066,793 in losses and loss adjustment expenses from $22,576,127 recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to $34,642,920 recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Crusader sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date based upon management’s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses. The ultimate cost of claims is dependent upon future events, the outcomes of which are affected by many factors. Crusader claim reserving procedures and settlement philosophy, current and perceived social and economic inflation, current and future court rulings and jury attitudes, improvements in medical technology, and many other economic, scientific, legal, political, and social factors all can have significant effects on the ultimate costs of claims. Changes in Crusader operations and management philosophy also may cause actual developments to vary from the past. Since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made.
The $26,683,872 provision for insured events of current year for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $7,298,930 higher than the $19,384,942 provision for insured events of current year for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to increased IBNR reserves associated with the Apartments & Commercial Buildings and Transportation verticals. The increases in IBNR reserves were due to higher actuarially developed ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily as a result of elevated expected claims severity.
The $7,959,048 adverse development of insured events of prior years for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $4,767,863 higher than the $3,191,185 adverse development of insured events of prior year for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to increases in 2018 and 2019 accident year IBNR reserves associated with the Apartments & Commercial Buildings and Transportation verticals. The increases in IBNR were due to higher actuarially developed ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily as a result of elevated expected claims severity.
Crusader has received 151 coronavirus-related business interruption claims through December 31, 2020. While the Company does not believe it is exposed to substantial risk from those claims under the insurance policies written by Crusader or USIC, the individual circumstances of each such claim are reviewed to fulfill Crusader’s obligation to its policyholders if coverage applies. Further, there may be impacts to the timing of loss emergence and ultimate loss ratios for certain Crusader’s products due to postponements of civil court cases, extensions of various statutes of limitations, changes in settlement trends and other new legislative, regulatory or judicial developments which could result in loss reserve deficiencies and negative impact on results of operations.
Crusader has received seven claims related to the recent civil unrest through December 31, 2020. Crusader has sufficient excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties to protect from exposure of such claims. The Company believes the losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with those claims will not exceed Crusader’s $500,000 excess of loss reinsurance treaty retention.
45 of 95
The following table breaks out adverse (favorable) development from total losses and loss adjustment expenses by accident year is as follows:
At the end of each fiscal quarter, Crusader’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for each accident year (i.e., for all claims incurred within each year) are re-evaluated independently by the Company’s president, the Company’s chief financial officer, and by an independent consulting actuary. Generally accepted actuarial methods, including the widely used Bornhuetter-Ferguson and loss development methods, are employed to estimate ultimate claims costs. An actuarial central estimate of the ultimate claims costs and IBNR reserves is ultimately determined by management and tested for reasonableness by the independent consulting actuary.
Repeated and sustained underwriting losses in Crusader’s Apartments & Commercial Buildings vertical and growth in Crusader’s Transportation vertical, a product which is generally known for its difficulty to be underwritten profitably, coupled with changes in the market conditions and increases in social inflation (discussed below), caused Crusader management to reevaluate the assumptions used in its process for estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. This reevaluation and the use of updated assumptions led to higher estimates for expected claims frequency, claims severity and ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses during the quarterly reevaluation of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of September 30, 2020. The increase in the ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses manifested primarily through higher IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2020 for 2018, 2019, and 2020 accident year claims pertaining to Apartments & Commercial Buildings and Transportation liability coverages.
Crusader attributes much of its adverse loss development experienced in the three most recent years ending December 31, 2020, to social inflation. Used here, social inflation is a term that encompasses a relatively new adverse trend related to society’s application of the law when it comes to insurance. In this context, social inflation is generally described by the rising costs of insurance claims due to societal trends which results in increased litigation, broader definitions of liability and contractual interpretations, plaintiff friendly legal decisions, larger compensatory jury awards, and larger awards for non-economic damages Crusader has experienced increased costs due to social inflation in all three of its largest market sector niches, Long-haul Transportation, Residential Apartment Buildings, and Bars/Taverns, resulting in higher-than-expected frequency and severity of third-party liability claims.
The variability of Crusader’s losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods presented is primarily due to the small and diverse population of Crusader’s policyholders and claims, which may result in greater fluctuations in claim frequency and/or severity. In addition, Crusader’s reinsurance retention, which is relatively high in relationship to its net earned premium, can result in increased loss ratio volatility when large losses are incurred in a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, management believes that its reinsurance retention is reasonable given the amount of Crusader’s surplus and its goal to minimize ceded premium.
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires estimation of certain liabilities, most significantly the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Management makes its best estimate of the liability for these unpaid claims costs as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the Crusader’s unpaid claims costs, actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments are expected to vary, perhaps significantly, from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims. Variability is inherent in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, especially for a small insurer such as Crusader. For any given line of insurance, accident year, or other group of claims, there is a continuum of possible loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates, each having its own unique degree of propriety or reasonableness. Due to the complexity and nature of the insurance claims process, there are potentially an infinite number of reasonably likely scenarios. Management draws on its collective experience to judgmentally determine its best estimate. In addition to applying a variety of standard actuarial methods to the data, an extensive series of diagnostic tests are applied to the resultant loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates to determine management’s best estimate of the unpaid claims liability. Among the statistics reviewed for each accident year are: loss and loss adjustment expense development patterns; frequencies; severities; and ratios of loss to premium, loss adjustment expense to premium, and loss adjustment expense to loss.
46 of 95
When there is clear evidence that the actual claims costs emerged are different than expected for any prior accident year, the claims cost estimates for that year are revised accordingly. If the claims costs that emerge are less favorable than initially anticipated, generally, Crusader increases its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves immediately. However, if the claims costs that emerge are more favorable than initially anticipated, generally, Crusader reduces its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves over time while it continues to assess the validity of the observed trends based on the subsequent emerged claim costs.
The establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is a detailed process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim. Estimates are based on a variety of industry data and on Crusader’s current and historical accident year claims data, including but not limited to reported claim counts, open claim counts, closed claim counts, closed claim counts with payments, paid losses, paid loss adjustment expenses, case loss reserves, case loss adjustment expense reserves, earned premiums and policy exposures, salvage and subrogation, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid. Many other factors, including changes in reinsurance, changes in pricing, changes in policy forms and coverage, changes in underwriting and risk selection, legislative changes, results of litigation and inflation are also taken into account.
Based on the loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as of December 31, 2020, the estimated ultimate loss ratio is within five percentage points of the initial expected loss ratio in 8 of Crusader’s 36 years. Since Crusader’s net earned premium in 2020 was $28,168,168, a difference between the accident year 2020 actual and initial expected loss ratios of five percentage points will or may ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by $1,408,408. The estimated ultimate loss ratio is within ten percentage points of the initial expected loss ratio in 13 of Crusader’s 36 years. A ten percentage point difference between the accident year 2020 actual and the initial expected loss ratios will or may ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by $2,816,817. The estimated ultimate loss ratio is within twenty percentage points of the initial expected loss ratio in 28 of Crusader’s 36 years. A twenty percentage point difference between the accident year 2020 actual and the initial expected loss ratios will or may ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by $5,633,634.
Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves
Crusader's liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves consists of case reserves and reserves for IBNR claims. Case reserves are established by claims personnel based on a review of the facts known at the time the claim is reported and are subsequently revised as more information about a claim becomes known. IBNR is estimated using various actuarial methods and techniques and includes (1) reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported to Crusader, and (2) a provision for expected future development on case reserves for information not currently known.
Crusader’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are as follows:
47 of 95
Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance for each of Crusader’s lines of business are as follows:
The Company‘s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for both reported and unreported claims. The Company sets these reserves at each quarterly balance sheet date based upon management’s best estimate of the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all reported and unreported claims.
The following table is a roll forward of Crusader’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance sheet liability for the periods indicated:
Since underwriting profit is a significant part of income, a small percentage change in reserve estimates may result in a substantial effect on future reported earnings. Such changes might result from a variety of factors, including claims costs emerging in a different pattern than the average historical development patterns.
If future development ultimately differs by five percent from Crusader’s 2020 net reserve, $2,631,993 would be reflected in future periods as an increase or decrease in the development of insured events of prior years and would be recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in future periods. If future development ultimately differs by ten percent from Crusader’s 2020 net reserve, $5,263,987 would be reflected in future periods as an increase or decrease in the development of insured events of prior years and would be recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in future periods.
Policy Acquisition Costs
Policy acquisition costs decreased $62,039 (1%) to $4,898,807 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4,960,846 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Policy acquisition costs consist of commissions, premium taxes, inspection fees, and certain other underwriting costs that are directly related to and vary with the successful production of Crusader insurance policies. These costs include both Crusader expenses and the allocated expenses of other Unico subsidiaries. Crusader's reinsurers pay Crusader a ceding commission, which is primarily a reimbursement of the acquisition cost related to the ceded premium. No ceding commission is received on ceded premium associated with property facultative excess of loss or catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties. Policy acquisition costs, net of ceding commission, are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned. The Company annually reevaluates its acquisition costs to determine that costs related to successful policy acquisition are capitalized and deferred.
48 of 95
Policy acquisition costs and the ratio to net earned premium are as follows:
Policy acquisition costs decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to increase of ceding commission that Crusader received as a result of increase in premium ceded to its reinsurers.
Salaries and Employee Benefits
Total salaries and employee benefits incurred increased $2,334,794 (30%) to $10,058,536 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7,723,742 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Salaries and employee benefits incurred and charged to operating expenses are as follows:
The increase in the total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due primarily to costs associated with a termination of an employment agreement with an executive, increases in executive compensation, increases in employee benefits due to higher medical insurance rates, and vacation accruals due to less vacation taken by the employees as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Commissions to Agents/Brokers
Commissions to agents/brokers (not including commissions on Crusader and USIC policies that are reflected in policy acquisition costs) are generally related to gross commission income from the health insurance program. Commissions to agents and brokers decreased $78,481 (45%) to $95,315 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $173,796 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This fluctuation in commissions to agents/brokers was due primarily to lower commissions associated with loss of a large group account.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses increased $1,658,331 (58%) to $4,502,414 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2,844,083 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due primarily to increases in legal, depreciation and communication expenses, fees associated with the reinsurance arrangement with USIC, and higher board of director fees.
Income Tax Expense/Benefit
Income tax expense was $3,547,598 (-20% of pre-tax loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and income tax benefit was $134,187 (4% of pre-tax loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The fluctuation in the income tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, is primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets on federal net operating losses.
49 of 95
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets of $7,769,603 generated from $36,998,110 of federal net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2035 and deferred tax assets of $2,402,438 generated from state net operating loss carryforwards which expire between 2028 and 2040. In connection with preparation of its consolidated financial statements, the Company periodically performs an analysis of future income projections to determine the adequacy of the valuation allowance. In light of the net losses that were generated in recent years, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company has established a valuation allowance for the aggregate amount of the federal and state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in the amount of $10,557,080 that, in management’s judgment, are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company carried a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated from federal and state net operating losses in the amount of $600,000 and $1,931,665, respectively.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates, actual results could differ.
Management believes the Company’s current critical accounting policies comprise the following:
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires estimation of certain liabilities, most significantly the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Management makes its best estimate of the liability for these unpaid claims costs as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the Company’s unpaid claims costs, actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments are expected to vary, perhaps significantly, from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims. Variability is inherent in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, especially for a small insurer such as Crusader. For any given line of insurance, accident year, or other group of claims, there is a continuum of possible loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates, each having its own unique degree of propriety or reasonableness. Due to the complexity and nature of the insurance claims process, there are potentially an infinite number of reasonably likely scenarios. Management draws on its collective experience to judgmentally determine its best estimate. In addition to applying a variety of standard actuarial methods to the data, extensive series of diagnostic tests are applied to the resultant loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates to determine management’s best estimate of the unpaid claims liability. Among the statistics reviewed for each accident year are: loss and loss adjustment expense development patterns; frequencies; severities; and ratios of loss to premium, loss adjustment expense to premium, and loss adjustment expense to loss.
When there is clear evidence that the actual claims costs emerged are different than expected for any prior accident year, the claims cost estimates for that year are revised accordingly. If the claims costs that emerge are less favorable than initially anticipated, generally, the Company increases its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves immediately. However, if the claims costs that emerge are more favorable than initially anticipated, generally, the Company reduces its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves over time while it continues to assess the validity of the observed trends based on the subsequent emerged claims costs.
Some lines of insurance are commonly referred to as "long-tail" lines because of the extended time required before claims are ultimately settled. Lines of insurance in which claims are settled relatively quicker are called "short-tail" lines. It is generally more difficult to estimate loss reserves for long-tail lines because of the long period of time that elapses between the occurrence of a claim and its final disposition and the difficulty of estimating the settlement value of the claim. Crusader’s short-tail lines consist of its property coverages, and its long-tail lines consist of its liability coverages. However, compared to other long-tail liability lines that are not underwritten by Crusader, such as workers’ compensation, professional liability, umbrella liability, and medical malpractice, Crusader’s liability claims tend to be settled relatively quicker. Since trends develop over longer periods of time on long-tail lines of business, the Company generally gives credibility to those trends more slowly than for short-tail or less volatile lines of business.
Crusader underwrites three statutory annual statement lines of business: (1) CMP, (2) liability other than automobile and products, and (3) fire. CMP policies comprised 99.6% and 98.3% of Crusader’s 2020 and 2019 gross written premium, respectively. CMP policies include both property and liability coverages. For all of Crusader’s coverages and lines of business, Crusader’s actuarial loss and loss adjustment expense reserving methods require assumptions that can be grouped into two key categories: (1) expected loss and loss adjustment expense development patterns and (2) expected loss and loss adjustment expense per premium dollar.

The Company also segregates most of its business into smaller homogeneous categories primarily for management’s internal detailed reserve review and analysis. These homogeneous categories used by the Company include various combinations and special groupings of its lines of business, programs types, states and coverages. Some categories exclude certain items and/or others include certain items. Not all categories are defined in the same way. This analysis includes the tracking of historical claims costs and development patterns separately for each of these uniquely defined categories. Generally, neither the liability development patterns nor the property development patterns vary significantly by category.
The establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is a detailed process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the reserve that is needed. Estimates are based on a variety of industry data and on Crusader’s current and historical accident year claims data, including but not limited to reported claim counts, open claim counts, closed claim counts, closed claim counts with payments, paid losses, paid loss adjustment expenses, case loss reserves, case loss adjustment expense reserves, earned premium and policy exposures, salvage and subrogation, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid. Many other factors, including changes in reinsurance, changes in pricing, changes in policy forms and coverage, changes in underwriting and risk selection, legislative changes, results of litigation and inflation are also taken into account.
At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company’s loss and loss adjustment reserves for each accident year (i.e., for all claims incurred within each year) are re-evaluated independently by the Company’s president, the Company’s chief financial officer, and by an independent consulting actuary. Generally accepted actuarial methods, including the widely used Bornhuetter-Ferguson and loss development methods, are employed to estimate ultimate claims costs. An actuarial central estimate of the ultimate claims costs and IBNR reserves is ultimately determined by management and tested for reasonableness by the independent consulting actuary.
Each year, management compares the actual claims costs that emerge to the claims costs that were expected to emerge and evaluates whether any observed significant differences are due to normal variances in the development process that occur from time to time, particularly in an insurer the size of Crusader, or if they are an indication that changes in the key reserve assumptions or methodologies are appropriate. Repeated and sustained underwriting losses in Crusader’s Apartments & Commercial Buildings vertical and growth in Crusader’s Transportation vertical, a product which is generally known for its difficulty to be underwritten profitably, coupled with changes in the market conditions and increases in social inflation caused Crusader management to reevaluate the assumptions used in its process for estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Crusader’s actuarially based loss and loss adjustment expense reserve methodology does not include an implicit or explicit provision for uncertainty. Insurance claims costs are inherently uncertain. There is not a precise means of quantifying in advance a provision for uncertainty when determining an appropriate liability for unpaid claims costs. Rather, the potential for claims costs being less than estimated and the potential for claims costs being more than estimated are considered when selecting the parameters to be used in the application of the actuarial methods and when testing the estimates for reasonableness. Management believes that its recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves make reasonable provision for its liability for unpaid claims costs.
The differences between actual and expected claims costs are typically not due to one specific factor but to a combination of many factors such as the period of time between the initial occurrence and the final settlement of the claim, current and perceived social and economic inflation, and many other economic, legal, political, and social factors. The information that management uses to arrive at its booked reserve estimate comes from many sources within the Company, including its accounting, claims, and underwriting departments. Informed managerial judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement amount will tend to be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as the emergence of property damage claims costs, tend to be subject to less variability than the emergence of long-tail liability claims costs. The liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses. Since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims should be expected to vary, perhaps significantly, from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made. Management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims, both reported and unreported.

The Company must estimate its ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using a very small claim population size. At the beginning of 2020, Crusader had 510 open claim files. During 2020, 793 new claim files were opened and 811 claim files were closed, leaving 492 open claim files at the end of 2020. Due to the small size of Crusader and the related small population of claims, Crusader’s losses and loss adjustment expenses for any accident year can vary significantly from the initial expectations. Due to the small number of claims, changes in claim frequency and/or severity can materially affect Crusader’s reserve estimate. The potential variability from management’s best estimate cannot be measured from any meaningful statistical basis due to the numerous uncertainties in the claims reserving process and the small population of claims.
At each quarterly review, actual claims costs that emerge are compared with the claims costs that were expected to emerge during that development period. Sometimes the previous claims costs estimates prove to have been too high; sometimes they prove to have been too low. The fluctuation in development of insured events of prior years underscores the inherent uncertainty in insurance claims costs, especially for a relatively small insurer, such as Crusader. While the Company believes the reserves were adequate at December 31, 2020 after the reevaluation, adverse or (favorable) development may emerge in the future.
Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made. Management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses make reasonable provision for all unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of the Company.
The changes in estimates of prior accident year incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses was due primarily to increases in IBNR reserves associated with the Apartments & Commercial Buildings and Transportation verticals resulting from higher estimates for expected claims frequency, claims severity and ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses during the re-evaluation of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.
The Company applies judgment in determining estimates for reserves associated with anticipated recoveries of salvage and subrogation on paid losses and loss adjustment expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company changed that estimate to be in-line with its historic salvage and subrogation recovery success pattern. The impact of that change was a $968,400 reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
Reinsurance
Crusader’s recoverable from reinsurers represents an estimate of the amount of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments that will be recoverable from Crusader’s reinsurers. These estimates are based upon estimates of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses that Crusader expects to incur and the portion of those losses that are expected to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of the reinsurance agreements. Given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses, the estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome. Crusader’s estimate of the amounts recoverable from reinsurers is regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available. Crusader’s assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts recoverable from reinsurers is based primarily upon public financial statements and rating agency data. Any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations. Crusader evaluates each of its ceded reinsurance contracts at its inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature. At December 31, 2020, all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance.

The effect of reinsurance on cash flow is the sum of the effect of reinsurance on the results of operations reflected above and the following changes in reinsurance recoverable:
There were no losses subject to catastrophe reinsurance treaties coverage incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
There have been no changes in key assumptions of estimating future ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses. The changes in estimates of prior accident year ceded incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are attributed to the passage of time and a greater amount of actual loss data available for each accident year.
Crusader’s reinsurance strategy is to protect Crusader against liabilities in excess of certain retentions, including major or catastrophic losses that may occur from any one or more of the property and/or casualty risks which it insures. On an annual basis, or sooner if warranted, Crusader evaluates whether any changes to its retention, participation, or retained limits are necessary. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are determined separately on both a direct basis and a net of reinsurance basis, and the ceded reserves are determined by subtraction. Therefore, reinsurance recoverable is determined in a manner consistent with the associated loss reserves. There have been no recent changes in key assumptions underlying the estimation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and no changes are anticipated. Ceded paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are determined by the terms of the individual treaties. The Company continually monitors and evaluates the collectability of reinsurance recoverable to determine if any allowance is necessary.
For years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Crusader wrote 99.9% of its business in the state of California. The types of businesses and the coverage limits written by Crusader are not considered difficult lines for obtaining reinsurance. In addition, because the major catastrophe exposure is primarily from riots and from fire following earthquakes, Crusader does not anticipate significant limitations on its ability to cede future losses on a basis consistent with its historical results.
Investments
The Company’s fixed maturity investments are classified either as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Although part of the Company's investments is classified as available-for-sale and the Company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions, or investment securities may be called by their issuers prior to the securities’ maturity, its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high-quality investments to maturity. Short-term investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company started investing in common stock equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s equity securities allocation is intended to enhance the return of and provide diversification for the total investment portfolio. The unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities are reported as “Accumulated other comprehensive income,” which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of any deferred tax effect. The net unrealized investment gains on equity securities is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When a decline in the value of a fixed maturity is considered other-than-temporary, a loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the specific identification method.
Deferred Tax Assets
The provision for federal income taxes is computed on the basis of income as reported for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Income tax expense provisions increase or decrease in the same period in which a change in tax rates is enacted.
54 of 95
At each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law. Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income of an appropriate nature and tax-planning strategies when making this assessment. In connection with preparation of its consolidated financial statements, the Company periodically performs an analysis of future income projections to determine the adequacy of the valuation allowance. In light of the net losses that were generated in recent years, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company has established a valuation allowance for the aggregate amount of the federal and state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in the amount of $10,557,080 that, in management’s judgment, are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company carried a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated from federal and state net operating losses in the amount of $600,000 and $1,931,665, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
