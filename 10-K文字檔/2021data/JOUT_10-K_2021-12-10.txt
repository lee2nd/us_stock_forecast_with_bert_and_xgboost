ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Unless otherwise stated, all monetary amounts in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other than per share amounts, are stated in thousands.
Executive Overview
The Company designs, manufactures and markets high quality recreational products for the outdoor enthusiast. Through a combination of innovative products, strong marketing, a talented and passionate workforce and efficient distribution, the Company seeks to set itself apart from the competition in its markets. Its subsidiaries operate as a network that promotes innovation and leverages best practices and synergies, following the strategic vision set by executive management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Due to the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company's primary-selling season during fiscal 2020 was interrupted resulting in a significant shift in sales volumes during the 2020 fiscal year toward the latter half of that fiscal year versus the 2019 fiscal year, where our heaviest sales volumes occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. As stay at home restrictions were lifted, the Company saw an increase in demand for many of its warm weather outdoor recreational products later during fiscal 2020 as consumers took advantage of being outdoors. As a result, each of our Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation segments experienced strong demand in the latter half of fiscal 2020. This demand continued into and throughout our fiscal 2021, resulting in increased sales volumes across all Company segments in fiscal 2021.
In addition to this significant increase in demand for Company products during fiscal 2021, COVID-19 has also caused widely-documented supply chain and logistics disruptions across industries, including those in which we operate, which have been exacerbated during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and into our fiscal 2022 due to the recent higher demand for our outdoor recreation products and associated inventory replenishment actions of our customers. These adverse supply chain constraints and disruptions have impacted the timing, sourcing, availability and cost of raw materials and components that are necessary to manufacture our outdoor recreation products. Specifically, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain of the Company's component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages across all of our segments for certain materials and components that are necessary to produce our products. As a result of these disruptions, starting during the latter portion of fiscal 2021, the Company took action to closely monitor its supply chain in order to meet the continued strong consumer demand and to attempt to continue to fulfill orders. These actions included building and procuring numerous categories of inventory (in some cases at significantly higher price points than what was historically paid) to mitigate against potential shortages during fiscal 2022 in certain of its materials and components that are necessary to manufacture Company products. These buying actions have resulted in the Company carrying significantly higher levels of inventory for a number of its materials, components and products at the end of fiscal 2021.
Because the Company expects that these same supply chain disruptions will continue into fiscal 2022, the Company remains focused on evaluating and pursuing additional options (beyond building inventory) to manage its supply chain to meet the continued strong consumer demand for its products. Nonetheless, these supply chain disruptions remain fluid and will likely impact the cost of goods sold for future sales of product or the Company’s ability to fill all customer demand for its products, especially given the volatility and changing circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Highlights
The Company's prior fiscal year ended October 2, 2020 comprised 53 weeks, whereas fiscal 2021 and 2019 each comprised 52 weeks. The additional week in fiscal 2020 increased net sales by less than 2% over the prior year. The Company’s fiscal 2021 revenues increased by 26% over the prior year, driven primarily by strong performance in the Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation segments where the Company saw strong demand for its outdoor recreation products as a result of consumers recreating outdoors in light of COVID-19. Operating profit in 2021 increased $40,213, or 57%, over 2020.
Results of Operations
Summary consolidated financial results from continuing operations for the fiscal years presented were as follows:
The Company’s internal and external sales and operating profit (loss) by business segment for each of the three most recent completed fiscal years were as follows:
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the definition of segment net sales and operating profit.
Fiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020
Net Sales
Net sales in 2021 increased by 26% to $751,651 compared to $594,209 in 2020. Foreign currency exchange had a favorable impact of less than 1%, on the current year’s sales versus the prior year.
Net sales for the Fishing business increased by $103,122, or 23% during 2021 from 2020. The increase over the prior year was driven by continued new product success and increased participation in fishing, principally as a result of the effect of COVID-19 on consumer recreation and leisure choices, resulting in higher demand across all product lines in this segment.
Camping net sales increased $21,329, or 51%, in 2021 from 2020. Increased sales of consumer tents and Jetboil products as a result of increased participation in outdoor recreation activities were the primary driver of the increase year over year.
Net sales in the Watercraft Recreation business increased $24,746, or 59%. Increased demand as a result of increased participation in watercraft recreation activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with new product success, drove the overall increase over the prior year.
Diving net sales increased $8,574, or 14%, year over year. Prior year sales were negatively impacted due to the effects of COVID-19 on demand globally due to restrictions in destination travel and tourism. As travel restrictions started to lift throughout fiscal 2021, tourism has begun to recover, resulting in increased demand and sales in this segment over the prior year. In addition, foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately 3.3% in 2021 versus the prior year period.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $417,526, or 55.5% of net sales, on a consolidated basis for fiscal 2021 compared to $329,216, or 55.4% of net sales, in the prior year. Higher sales volumes between years were the primary driver of the increase in the cost of sales between periods. Favorable product mix and pricing between fiscal years offset the impact of approximately $7,200 of additional tariffs on Chinese goods and components during fiscal 2021, as well as increased freight costs over the prior year.
Gross Profit
Gross profit of $334,125 was 44.5% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended October 1, 2021 compared to $264,993, or 44.6% of net sales in the prior year.
Gross profit in the Fishing business increased by $39,676 from the prior year due primarily to the 23% increase in net sales year over year. Favorable product mix and improved absorption of overhead costs during fiscal 2021 partially offset approximately $5,900 of additional tariff costs on Chinese sourced goods and components and higher freight costs incurred during fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020.
Camping gross profit increased by $11,497 from 2020 due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and a favorable mix of products sold in the current year as compared to the prior year.
Gross profit in the Watercraft Recreation segment increased by $12,289 from 2020 due primarily to increased sales volumes in 2021 versus the prior year and the resulting improvement in absorption of overhead costs.
The $5,463 increase in gross profit in the Diving segment was due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and favorable product mix during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased from the prior year by $28,919. The increase was driven primarily by higher sales volume related costs incurred in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Additionally, increased headcount and compensation costs further increased expenses year over year.
Operating expenses for the Fishing segment increased by $13,069 from fiscal 2020 levels. The increase was due primarily to higher sales volume related expenses, as well as increased people costs between years.
Camping operating expenses increased by $1,879 from the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses.
In the Watercraft Recreation segment, operating expenses increased $2,787 from their levels in fiscal 2020 due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses in 2021, partially offset by decreased spending rate on advertising and promotions.
Operating expenses for the Diving business increased by $1,357 year over year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses, as well as increased people costs between periods.
The Company's 2021 general corporate expenses of $36,317 increased $9,827 from $26,490 in 2020. The year over year increase reflects higher people costs including $2,900 of higher deferred compensation expenses and higher health insurance costs over the prior year as well as higher professional services expense.
Operating Results
The Company’s operating profit was $111,283 in fiscal 2021 compared to an operating profit of $71,070 in fiscal 2020. Fishing operating profit increased by $26,606 to $122,490 from $95,884 in the prior year due primarily to higher sales volumes between years. The operating profit for Camping was $14,025 compared to $4,406 in 2020 which increase was also primarily a result of higher sales volumes between periods. The operating profit for the Watercraft Recreation business was $9,173 in fiscal 2021 compared to a loss of $329 in fiscal 2020 due to the factors noted above on changes in sales volumes and operating expenses. Operating profit for the Diving business increased by $4,106 in fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2020, due to recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and demand for our Diving products and the other factors discussed above.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest expense of $145 was relatively flat as compared to the prior year expense of $143. Interest income of $366 decreased from prior year interest income of $1,413 due to the decrease in deposit interest rates year over year. Net other income of $1,418 in fiscal 2021 increased slightly from net other income of $1,362 in fiscal 2020. The current year net other income included currency losses of $215 and market gains and dividends of $5,329 on deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by pension termination expense of $2,526. In the prior year, net other income included $269 of currency losses and $2,454 of market gains and dividends on the deferred compensation plan assets. The dividends and market gains and losses on deferred compensation plan assets recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in “Other income, net” are offset as compensation expense in “Operating expenses.”
Pretax Income and Income Taxes
The Company realized pretax income of $112,922 in fiscal 2021 compared to $73,702 in fiscal 2020. The Company recorded income tax expense of $29,541 in 2021, which equated to an effective tax rate of 26.2%, compared to $18,469 in 2020, which equated to an effective tax rate of 25.1%.
Net Income
The Company recognized net income of $83,381, or $8.21 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2021 compared to $55,233, or $5.47 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2020 based on the factors discussed above.
Fiscal 2020 vs. Fiscal 2019
Net Sales
Net sales in 2020 increased by 6% to $594,209 compared to $562,419 in 2019. The additional week in the fiscal year drove an increase in net sales of approximately 1.5% over fiscal 2019. Foreign currency exchange had a $651 unfavorable impact, less than 1%, on 2020 fiscal year’s sales versus 2019.
Net sales for the Fishing business increased by $37,757, or 9% during 2020 from 2019. Increased demand late in fiscal 2020 was more than enough to overcome the impact of COVID-19 related restrictions and shutdowns earlier in 2020, resulting in the increase between years.
Camping net sales increased $1,213, or 3%, in 2020 from 2019. Increased sales of consumer tents and Jetboil products as a result of increased participation in outdoor recreation activities were more than enough to overcome declines in military tent sales year over year.
Net sales in the Watercraft Recreation business increased $8,359, or 25% in 2020 from 2019. Despite COVID-19 related shutdowns early in fiscal 2020, increased demand later in the year drove the overall increase over 2019. See "Coronavirus (COVID-19)" above for more information regarding the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on our fiscal 2020 sales.
Diving net sales decreased $15,433, or 20%, from 2020 to 2019. The decrease was largely due to the effects of COVID-19 on demand globally due to restrictions during 2020 in destination travel and tourism. In addition, foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1% in 2020 versus 2019.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $329,216, or 55.4% of net sales, on a consolidated basis for fiscal 2020 compared to $312,663, or 55.6% of net sales, in the prior year. Higher sales volumes between years were the primary driver of the increase in the cost of sales between periods. Additionally, the impact of approximately $2,000 of additional tariffs during fiscal 2020, which increased our cost of sales, on Chinese goods and components over the prior year was offset by favorable product mix and pricing between fiscal years.
Gross Profit
Gross profit of $264,993 was 44.6% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended October 2, 2020 compared to $249,756, or 44.4% of net sales in fiscal 2019.
Gross profit in the Fishing business increased by $18,625 from 2019 to 2020 due primarily to the 9% increase in net sales year over year. The recovery of overpayments of excise taxes during fiscal 2020 more than offset approximately $1,000 of new tariff costs on Chinese sourced goods and components incurred during fiscal 2020.
Camping gross profit in fiscal 2020 increased by $1,321 from 2019 due primarily to increased sales volumes and a favorable mix of products sold in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.
Gross profit in the Watercraft Recreation segment increased in fiscal 2020 by $3,840 from 2019 due primarily to increased sales volumes in 2020 versus 2019 and the resulting improvement in absorption of overhead costs.
The $8,467 decrease in gross profit in the Diving segment from 2019 to 2020 was due primarily to decreased sales volumes during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased during fiscal 2020 from 2019 by $7,941. The increase was driven primarily by higher sales volume related costs incurred in fiscal 2020 as compared to the fiscal 2019. Additionally, increased headcount and people costs further increased expenses year over year.
Operating expenses for the Fishing segment increased in fiscal 2020 by $6,832 from fiscal 2019 levels. The increase was due primarily to higher sales volume related expenses between years and increased headcount related expenses incurred in fiscal 2020.
Camping operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 by $189 from 2019 due primarily to efforts to reduce spending in light of COVID-19 uncertainties during 2020, primarily as it related to travel, entertainment and advertising expenses.
In the Watercraft Recreation segment, fiscal 2020 operating expenses increased $1,347 from their levels in fiscal 2019 due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses in 2020.
Operating expenses for the Diving business decreased by $2,848 year over year due primarily to lower sales volume related expenses, as well as lower headcount related expenses between periods.
The Company's fiscal 2020 general corporate expenses of $26,490 increased $2,799 from $23,961 in 2019. The year over year increase primarily reflects $1,800 of higher deferred compensation expenses, as well as higher health insurance costs offset in part by decreased investment in marketing support between years.
Operating Results
The Company’s operating profit was $71,070 in fiscal 2020 compared to an operating profit of $63,774 in fiscal 2019. Fishing operating profit increased by $11,792 to $95,884 in fiscal 2020 from $84,092 in fiscal 2019 due primarily to higher sales volumes between years. The operating profit for Camping in fiscal 2020 was $4,406 compared to $2,896 in 2019 which increase was also primarily a result of higher sales volumes between periods. The operating loss for the Watercraft Recreation business was $329 in fiscal 2020 compared to a loss of $2,822 in fiscal 2019 due to the factors noted above on changes in sales volumes and operating expenses. Operating profit for the Diving business decreased by $5,619 in fiscal 2020 from fiscal 2019, due to the impact of COVID-19 and demand for our Diving products and the other factors discussed above.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest expense in fiscal 2020 of $143 declined slightly from 2019 expense of $172. Interest income in fiscal 2020 of $1,413 decreased from 2019 interest income of $2,109 due to declining interest rates in 2020. Net other income of $1,362 in fiscal 2020 increased from net other income of $796 in fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 net other income included currency losses of $269 and market gains and dividends of $2,454 on deferred compensation plan assets. In fiscal 2019, net other income included $645 of currency gains and $610 of market gains and dividends on the deferred compensation plan assets. The dividends and market gains and losses on deferred compensation plan assets recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in “Other income, net” are offset as compensation expense in “Operating expenses.”
Pretax Income and Income Taxes
The Company realized pretax income of $73,702 in fiscal 2020 compared to $66,507 in fiscal 2019. The Company recorded income tax expense of $18,469 in 2020, which equated to an effective tax rate of 25.1%, compared to $15,094 in 2019, which equated to an effective tax rate of 22.7%.
Net Income
The Company recognized net income of $55,233, or $5.47 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2020 compared to $51,413, or $5.11 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2019 based on the factors discussed above.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchase requirements, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next twelve months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends will come from its current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities.
The Company considers all short-term investments in interest-bearing bank accounts, and all securities and other instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, to be equivalent to cash. Short-term investments in prior years consisted of certificates of deposit, with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade.
The Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:
Operating Activities
The following table sets forth the Company’s working capital position at the end of each of the years shown:
Cash flows provided by operations totaled $58,318, $61,493 and $45,844 in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash flows provided by operations decreased slightly from the prior year despite an increase in net income due primarily to increases in inventory levels and other working capital changes.
Depreciation and amortization charges were $13,401, $14,926 and $13,964 in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Investing Activities
Cash flows used for investing activities were $21,381 and $15,587 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, and cash flows provided by investing activities were $11,989 in 2019. There were no sales or purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2021 or 2020, while proceeds from the sale of short-term investments in 2019 provided cash of $35,838, offset by purchases of $7,124. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $21,409, $15,600 and $16,786 in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In general, the Company’s ongoing capital expenditures are primarily related to tooling for new products, facilities investments and information systems improvements.
Financing Activities
Cash flows used for financing activities totaled $9,033 in fiscal 2021 compared to $7,107 and $6,186 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were primarily for the payment of dividends of $8,400 and $6,773 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2019, dividend payments totaled $5,557.
Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments under its operating leases and open purchase orders. There have been no changes outside of the ordinary course of business in the specified contractual obligations during the year ended October 1, 2021.
The Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future claims under its workers’ compensation insurance. Letters of credit outstanding at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 were $181 and $181, respectively, and were
included in the Company’s total loan availability. The Company had no unsecured revolving credit facilities at its foreign subsidiaries as of October 1, 2021 or October 2, 2020.
The Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $96 to its defined benefit pension plans through September 30, 2022.
The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.
Market Risk Management
Coronavirus outbreak
As disclosed in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere herein, in December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19"), began to spread globally, leaving no region or part of the world unaffected by the pandemic it has created. Governments and health authorities have been taking, and continue to take, measures to prevent the spread of this virus (including in certain cases requiring or recommending a vaccine or imposing testing requirements), but it is presently unknown to what extent they will be successful or the potential timing of these measures and their outcome and impact on the Company's business in the future. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to persist, among other things, the ability of the Company’s suppliers to manufacture and deliver the products that it sells to the Company, the ability of the Company to manufacture and deliver its products to its customers, the Company's ability to display its products at trade shows and similar events, the Company's ability to conduct meetings with its customers and prospective customers, and, if a significant number of its employees at a particular facility or location were to contract coronavirus, the Company’s ability to conduct its day-to-day operations could be adversely impacted. The financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Company will depend on future developments, including related to any supply chain disruptions, that the Company cannot reasonably predict or estimate at this time, but any of which could materially and adversely affect its results for an unknown but possibly extended period. See the section "Risk Factors" identified in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for more information.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Hong Kong dollars and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly. Approximately 12% of the Company’s revenues for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2021 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 4% were denominated in euros and approximately 6% were denominated in Canadian dollars, with the remaining 2% denominated in various other foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can cause unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company operates in a seasonal business and experiences significant fluctuations in operating cash flow as working capital needs increase in advance of the Company’s primary selling and cash generation season, and decline as accounts receivable are collected and cash is accumulated.
Commodities
Certain components used in the Company’s products are exposed to commodity price changes. The Company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non-cancellable supply contracts. Primary commodity price exposures include costs associated with metals, resins and packaging materials.
Impact of Inflation
The Company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials may impact future operating costs and, accordingly, the prices of its products. The Company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies. Price increases and, in certain situations, price decreases are implemented for individual products, when appropriate.
The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. The Company does not believe that inflation has significantly affected its results of operations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company’s management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related footnote disclosures. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates for product returns, bad debts, inventories, long lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, litigation and other subjective matters impacting the financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer accounts receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Though the Company considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the Company operates and any specific customer collection issues the Company identifies could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.
Inventories
The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in first-out method) or net realizable value. Management’s judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory. Inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than will be used to meet future needs. Inventory reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. The Company also considers current forecast plans, as well as market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels. Though the Company considers these reserve balances to be adequate, changes in economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.
Deferred Taxes
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairment
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Generally, annual impairment tests are performed by the Company in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. When fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized based on the excess of carrying amount over its fair value. The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
The discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate fair value requires a number of key estimates and assumptions. The Company estimates the future cash flows of the reporting units based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs and applies a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for purposes of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which includes certain assumptions made by management such as market capital structure, market betas, the risk-free rate of return and the estimated costs of borrowing. Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect our impairment analysis in a given year.
In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s other indefinite lived intangible assets, the Company estimates the fair value of the various intangible assets. The fair value of trademarks and patents is estimated using the relief from royalty method. If the fair value of an intangible asset exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. When fair value is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the difference.
A number of factors, many of which the Company has no ability to control, could affect its financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in preparing its financial statements. These factors include: a prolonged global economic crisis, a significant decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and successful efforts by the Company’s competitors to gain market share.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as unplanned negative cash flow indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Application of alternative assumptions, such as changes in the estimate of future cash flows, could produce significantly different results. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
Warranties
The Company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services. Warranty reserves are estimated using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. Estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience, expectation of future conditions and known product issues. To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required. The Company engages in product quality programs and processes, including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers, to help minimize warranty obligations.
