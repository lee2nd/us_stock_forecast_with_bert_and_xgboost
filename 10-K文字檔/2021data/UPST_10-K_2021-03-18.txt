ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled “Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.
Overview
Upstart applies modern data science and technology to the process of underwriting consumer credit. By providing our bank partners with a proprietary AI-based origination platform, we help them originate credit with higher approval rates, lower loss rates and a high degree of automation. As our technology continues to improve and additional banks adopt our platform, consumers benefit from improved access to affordable and frictionless credit.
We believe that banks will continue to be at the forefront of consumer lending in the United States. We believe AI lending will become increasingly critical as this industry continues to undergo a broad digital transformation. Our strategy is to partner with banks, providing them with an exceptional AI lending platform that they can configure as they originate consumer loans under their own brand, according to their own business and regulatory requirements.
Consumers can obtain Upstart-powered loans in one of two ways: either by referral from Upstart.com to one of our bank partners, or directly through our bank partners’ own websites, where our lending technology and experience is bank-branded. Our direct bank partner channel represents a small but growing portion of our overall volume, and we believe this portion will continue to grow over time as we onboard new bank partners.
Our bank partners can retain loans that align with their business and risk objectives. For loans that are not retained by our bank partners, we help diversify the funding of these loans to a broad base of institutional investors that invest in Upstart-powered loans. In the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 21% of Upstart-powered loans were retained by the originating bank, while about 77% of Upstart-powered loans were purchased by institutional investors through our loan funding programs. Over the last few years, the percentage of loans retained by bank partners has fluctuated, but generally increased, while the percentage of loans funded through our balance sheet has generally decreased and the percentage of loans purchased by institutional investors has remained high and relatively stable.
Our Economic Model
Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.
We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

Loans on our platform today are predominantly sourced from Upstart.com. For these loans, we incur variable costs in the form of borrower acquisition costs and borrower verification and servicing costs. Borrower acquisition costs and borrower verification and servicing costs are highly correlated with the Number of Loans Transacted on our platform and trended upwards on an annual basis. A small number of loans were sourced directly through bank partners in which we received no referral fee and incurred no acquisition cost. The rising level of automation and continued improvements to our Conversion Rate achieved through our increasingly sophisticated risk models and our evolving channel mix have contributed to improving loan unit economics over time. We further believe that bank-sourced loans can be an important driver of volume growth in the medium-term future; to the extent we are able to increase the number of loans sourced directly through our bank partners, our contribution margin would be positively impacted.
COVID-19 Pandemic Impact
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact origination volumes on our platform in the second half of March 2020. A rapid rise in unemployment in the United States led to the potential for increased losses for new originations by our AI models, reduction in originations by bank partners, and a temporary pause in loan funding from institutions and capital markets. These factors collectively resulted in an 86% reduction in the number of loans originated and a 73% reduction in revenue in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2020.
In response to the market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we made certain operational changes, including increases to the fees we charge our bank partners and reductions in our sales and marketing activities and certain operational expenses. We continue to evaluate market and other conditions and may make additional changes to our fees or marketing activities, or implement additional operational changes, in the future.
Origination volumes recovered quickly, beginning in June 2020, as unemployment plateaued. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Number of Loans Transacted was 300,379, representing a 40% increase compared to the Number of Loans Transacted in the year ended December 31, 2019.
To support borrowers suffering from income loss due to the pandemic, Upstart worked with its bank partners to offer hardship plans that, among other things, allowed affected borrowers to defer loan payments for up to two months. At the peak, approximately 5.6% of borrowers on our platform had enrolled in a hardship program, less than half the rate of online lending industry benchmarks. Since this time, approximately 95% of these impacted borrowers have exited the hardship program and resumed making loan payments. Due to the strength of our AI model, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will have minimal impact on bank partners and institutional investor performance for Upstart-powered loans originated prior to the second quarter of 2020.
Although significant government assistance was provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, the resilience of our bank partner results during this time provides evidence of the benefits that our AI models can offer to bank lending programs. We believe these benefits are even more compelling and valuable during periods of economic downturn.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Continued Improvements to Our AI Models
Much of our historical growth has been driven by improvements to our AI models. These models benefit over time from a flywheel effect that is characteristic of machine learning systems: accumulation of repayment data leads to improved accuracy of risk and fraud predictions, which results in higher approval rates and lower interest rates, leading to increased volume, and consequently greater accumulation of repayment data. This virtuous cycle describes an important mechanism by which our business grows simply through model learning and recalibration. We expect to continue to invest significantly in the development of our AI models and platform functionalities.

(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Beyond the ongoing accumulation of repayment data used to train our models, we also frequently make discrete improvements to model accuracy by upgrading algorithms and incorporating new variables, both of which have historically resulted in higher approval rates, more competitive loan offers, increased automation, and faster growth. As a second order effect, the impact of these improvements on our conversion funnel also allow us to unlock new marketing channels over time that have previously been unprofitable.
We believe that ongoing improvements to our technology in this manner will allow us to further expand access and lower rates for creditworthy borrowers, which will continue to fuel our growth. Should the pace of these improvements slow down or cease, or should we discover forms of model upgrades which improve accuracy at the expense of volume, our growth rates could be adversely affected.
Bank and Market Adoption
Banks play two key roles in Upstart’s ecosystem: funding loans and acquiring new customers. Banks tend to enjoy among the most efficient sources of funding due to their expansive base of deposits. As they adopt our technology and fund a growing proportion of our platform transactions, offers made to borrowers will typically improve, generally leading to higher conversion rates and faster growth for our platform.
New bank partners also represent additional acquisition channels through which we can reach and source prospective new borrowers, as these banks develop and implement their own digital and in-branch campaigns to drive traffic from their existing customer base to our platform. We view this emerging growth channel to be additive to the marketing acquisition programs we currently run at Upstart.
To provide funding support for our bank partners, we have built a broad network of institutional investors that can fund Upstart-powered loans through secondary loan purchasing, issuance of pass-through certificates and investment in asset-backed securitizations. This diverse network of capital helps to minimize our reliance on any one funding source. However, any trend towards reduced participation by banks will generally erode the overall competitiveness of the offers on our platform, and any declining trend in the participation of broader institutional investment markets with respect to funding availability for Upstart-powered loans could adversely affect our business.
Product Expansion and Innovation
We intend to continue developing new financial products that address a broader set of consumer needs over time. We recently announced our entry into the auto lending market and we believe that significant growth opportunities exist to apply our evolving technology to additional segments of credit, such as credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans, and HELOCs. In addition, we aim to serve a broader role of technology enablement for banks, which we believe will seek more comprehensive technology solutions from their suppliers. For example, we recently began offering an application programming interface product to banks that allows them to utilize our AI underwriting models to support their loan origination process for personal, auto, and student loans. We will incur expenses and opportunity cost to develop and launch new products. Monetization prospects for new products are uncertain, and costs associated with developing and marketing new products might not be recovered, which could weigh on our top-line growth and profitability.
Impact of Macroeconomic Cycles
Economic cycles can impact our financial performance and related metrics, including consumer demand for loans, conversion rates and the interest rates our bank partners and institutional investors are willing to accept. In a potential downturn, we believe consumer lending will generally contract, including the volume transacted on our own platform. However, the performance of Upstart-powered loans through an economic downturn, such as that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, will be important in further validating our AI models with banks and institutional investors. If we are able to continue demonstrating the resilience of Upstart-powered loans through future macroeconomic cycles relative to general consumer credit, it could strengthen our competitive positioning as we emerge from such downturns.

Key Operating and Financial Metrics
We focus on several key operating and financial metrics to measure the performance of our business and help determine strategic direction.
_______
(1)Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further information.
Number of Loans Transacted
We define the Number of Loans Transacted as the transaction volume, measured by number of loans facilitated on our platform, between a borrower and originating bank during the period presented. We believe this metric to be a good proxy for our overall scale and reach as a platform.
Conversion Rate
We define Conversion Rate as the Number of Loans Transacted in a period divided by the number of rate inquiries received, which we record when a borrower requests a loan offer on our platform. We track this metric to understand the impact of improvements to the efficiency of our borrower funnel on our overall growth. Historically, our Conversion Rate has benefited from improvements to our technology, which have made our evaluation of risk more accurate and our verification process more automated, or from the addition of bank partners that have made our offers more competitive. Our ability to continue to improve our Conversion Rate depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our AI models and Percentage of Loans Fully Automated and the mix of marketing channels in any given period.
Percentage of Loans Fully Automated
A key driver of our contribution margin and operating efficiency is the Percentage of Loans Fully Automated, which is defined as the total number of loans in a given period originated end-to-end (from initial rate request to final funding) with no human involvement divided by the Number of Loans Transacted in the same period. We have been successful in increasing the level of loan automation on the platform over the past few years while simultaneously holding fraud rates constant and at very low levels. We believe our growth over the last several years has been driven in part by our ability to rapidly streamline and automate the loan application and origination process on our platform. We expect the Percentage of Loans Fully Automated to level off and remain relatively constant in the long term, and to the extent we expand our loan offerings beyond unsecured personal loans, we expect that such percentage may decrease in the short term.

Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin
To derive Contribution Profit, we subtract from revenue from fees, net our borrower acquisition costs as well as our borrower verification and servicing costs. To calculate Contribution Margin we divide Contribution Profit by revenue from fees, net.
The following table provides a calculation of Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin:
_______
(1)Borrower acquisition costs consist of our sales and marketing expenses adjusted to exclude costs not directly attributable to attracting a new borrower, such as payroll-related expenses for our business development and marketing teams, as well as other operational, brand awareness and marketing activities
(2)Borrower verification and servicing costs consist of payroll and other personnel-related expenses for personnel engaged in loan onboarding, verification and servicing, as well as servicing system costs. It excludes payroll and personnel-related expenses and stock-based compensation for certain members of our customer operations team whose work is not directly attributable to onboarding and servicing loans.
See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of income (loss) from operations to Contribution Profit.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Upstart Holdings, Inc. stockholders adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, expense on warrants and other non-operating expenses, net and provision for income taxes. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin includes interest expense from corporate debt and warehouse credit facilities which is incurred in the course of earning corresponding interest income. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Upstart Holdings, Inc. common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.

Components of Results of Operations
Revenue from Fees, Net
Platform and Referral Fees, Net
We charge our bank partners platform fees in exchange for usage of our AI lending platform, which includes collection of loan application data, underwriting of credit risk, verification and fraud detection, and the delivery of electronic loan offers and associated documentation. We also charge referral fees to our bank partners in exchange for the referral of borrowers from Upstart.com. Referral fees are charged to bank partners on a per borrower basis upon origination of a loan. For bank partners that use our loan funding capabilities, these fees are charged net of any fees the bank partner charges Upstart. Upstart pays these bank partners a one-time loan premium fee upon completion of the minimum holding periods. Upstart also pays bank partners monthly loan trailing fees based on the amount and timing of principal and interest payments made by borrowers of the underlying loans. See “Note 2. Revenue” to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information about loan premium fees and trailing fees.
Servicing Fees, Net
Servicing fees are calculated as a percentage of outstanding principal and are charged monthly to any entities holding loans facilitated through our platform, to compensate us for activities we perform throughout the loan term, including collection, processing and reconciliations of payments received, investor reporting and borrower customer support. Servicing fees are recorded net of any gains, losses or changes to fair value recognized in the underlying servicing rights and obligations, which are carried as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Upstart currently acts as loan-servicer for substantially all outstanding loans facilitated through the Upstart platform. Borrower payment collections for loans that are more than 30 days past due or charged off are generally outsourced to third-party collection agencies. Upstart charges bank partners and institutional investors for collection agency fees related to their outstanding loan portfolio. Upstart also receives certain ancillary fees on a per transaction basis inclusive of late payment fees and ACH fail fees.
Interest Income and Fair Value Adjustments, Net
Interest income and fair value adjustments, net is comprised of interest income, interest expense and net changes in the fair value of financial instruments held on our consolidated balance sheets as part of our ongoing operating activities, excluding loan servicing assets and liabilities, common stock warrant liabilities, and convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities. Interest income and fair value adjustments, net also includes the full amount of net interest income and expense incurred by consolidated variable interest entities, or VIEs, the majority of which has been historically allocated to third parties in the line item net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Interest income and fair value adjustments, net can fluctuate based on the fair value of financial instruments held on our consolidated balance sheets. This amount has historically been a small percentage of our total revenue, and we do not manage our business with a focus on growing this component of revenue.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of costs incurred across various advertising channels, including expenses for partnerships with third parties providing borrower referrals, direct mail and digital advertising campaigns, as well as other expenses associated with building overall brand awareness and experiential marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll and other personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel, increase our marketing activities and build greater brand awareness.

(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Customer Operations
Customer operations expenses include payroll and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in borrower onboarding, loan servicing, customer support and other operational teams. These costs also include systems, third-party services and tools we use as part of loan servicing, information verification, fraud detection and payment processing activities. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. We expect that our customer operations expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue over time, as we expand our portfolio and increase the Number of Loans Transacted.
Engineering and Product Development
Engineering and product development expenses primarily consist of payroll and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for the engineering and product development teams as well the costs of systems and tools used by these teams. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. We expect that our engineering and product development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of our total revenue over time, as we expand our engineering and product development team to continue to improve our AI models and develop new products and product enhancements.
General, Administrative and Other
General, administrative and other expenses consist primarily of payroll and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for legal and compliance, finance and accounting, human resources and facilities teams, as well as depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and software, professional services fees, facilities and travel expenses. These costs are recognized in the period incurred. Following the completion of our initial public offering in December 2020, we expect to incur additional general, administrative and other expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. As a result, we expect that our general, administrative and other expenses will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period.
Other Income
Other income primarily consists of dividend income earned on our unrestricted cash balances and in 2018 also included sublease income. Other income is recognized in the period earned. During the year ended December 31, 2020, other income also included the proceeds from a forgivable loan under the Paycheck Protection Program. For additional details, refer to “Note 1. Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In March 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the Company’s intent to voluntarily repay proceeds received under the Paycheck Protection Program in the second quarter of 2021. There has been no change in the Company’s assessment that forgiveness of the loan under the CARES Act is reasonably assured. Upon repayment, the Company’s other income will be reduced by the repayment amount of approximately $5.3 million.
Expense on Warrants and Other Non-Operating Expenses
Expense on warrants and other non-operating expenses is primarily comprised of the net changes in the fair value of our common and convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities, as well as interest expense on convertible notes outstanding in 2018.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
2019 Compared to 2020
Revenue from fees, net increased $68.8 million, or 43%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, which included an increase of $56.2 million in revenue from platform and referral fees, net and an increase of $12.6 million in servicing fees, net. The increase of the platform and referral fees, net was primarily driven by a 40% increase in the Number of Loans Transacted from 215,122 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 300,379 in the year ended December 31, 2020 as well as an increase in prices of our services in response to the market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the servicing fees, net was primarily due to an 96% increase in outstanding loan principal, as well as a downward revaluation to the net liability of our servicing obligation.
2018 Compared to 2019
Revenue from fees, net increased $71.4 million, or 81%, in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $60.7 million in revenue from platform and referral fees, net. This increase was primarily driven by an 88% increase in the Number of Loans Transacted from 114,125 in 2018 to 215,122 in 2019. Servicing fees, net increased by $10.7 million due to a doubling in average outstanding loan principal, as well as a downward revaluation to the net liability of our servicing obligation.
Interest Income and Fair Value Adjustments, Net
(1) Consist of balances recognized by entities participating in ongoing operating activities of the Company, including warehouse entities.
(2) Consists of balances recognized by other entities, including securitization entities and the fractional loan program (discontinued in 2019).
2019 Compared to 2020
Interest income and fair value adjustments, net increased $0.5 million, or 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by a $40.4 million decline in interest income partially offset by a decline in interest expense and fair value adjustments, of $16.9 million and $28.4 million, respectively, recognized by other consolidated entities. These decreases were due to a reduction of consolidated loan balances from securitization-related VIEs caused by the deconsolidation of previously consolidated securitizations 2017-1, 2017-2, and 2018-1. The deconsolidation of these entities was a result of the expiration of the related risk retention requirements, which caused us to conclude that we are no longer a primary beneficiary of these entities. For additional details, refer to “Note 3. Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities” of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The decrease of the total net interest income and fair value
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
adjustments, net was also caused by an increase of $9.4 million of fair value adjustments recognized by the operating entities. These negative adjustments were primarily due to the market changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase was partially offset by an increase of $3.5 million of interest income in these entities. This increase was a result of an increased average loan balances held by the operating entities during these periods.
2018 Compared to 2019
Interest income and fair value adjustments, net decreased $6.5 million, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a $19.5 million decline in interest income due to a reduction of consolidated loan balances from other consolidated entities, including securitization-related VIEs, in the year ended December 31, 2019. This reduction was primarily a result of the change in the structure of the risk retention for securitizations sponsored by the Company, which allowed the Company to conclude that it is not a primary beneficiary of securitizations completed after the first half of 2018. For additional details, refer to “Note 3. Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities” of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This decrease was partially offset by the increase of $6.2 million in the amount of interest income recognized by the operating entities due to a higher average loan balances held by operating entities as well as the lower amount of fair value adjustments to consolidated assets held by the other consolidated entities, which decreased by $6.0 million, primarily due to a reduction of consolidated loan balances from these entities.
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing
2019 Compared to 2020
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $6.5 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.

As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 57% to 43%.
2018 Compared to 2019
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $29.5 million, or 46%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased spending of $26.8 million for partnerships with parties providing borrower referrals and a $1.6 million increase in payroll and other personnel-related expenses driven by increased headcount, as well as a $1.1 million increase in advertising and other traffic acquisition costs. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 64% to 57%.
Customer Operations
2019 Compared to 2020
Customer operations expenses increased by $12.6 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $9.4 million in payroll and other personnel-related expenses due to an increase in headcount as well as increased spending of $3.1 million in information verification and platform operations due to a growing volume of loans facilitated through our platform. As a percentage of total revenue, customer operations expenses increased from 15% to 16%.

Expense on warrants and other non-operating expenses, net increased by $10.0 million, or 708%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of a $5.9 million increase in the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants and $4.1 million increase in the fair value of common stock warrants driven by the increase in the fair value of our common stock.
2018 Compared to 2019
Expense on warrants and other non-operating expenses, net decreased by $2.3 million, or 62%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $2.1 million in the fair value of outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants as a result of warrants exercised or repurchased and retired during the year, and a decrease in interest expense on convertible notes of $0.7 million as the convertible notes were converted into convertible preferred stock in the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in the fair value of common stock warrants.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the non-GAAP financial measures Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share to provide investors with additional information about our financial performance and to enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with the performance of other companies.
However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
To address these limitations, we provide a reconciliation of Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share to loss from operations and net loss attributable to Upstart Holdings, Inc. common stockholders, respectively. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income (loss), and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial measures.
Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin
We use Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance. We believe Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in evaluating and understanding our operating results and ability to scale. Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin are also useful to investors because our management uses Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin, in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate our operating results and financial performance and the effectiveness of our strategies.
Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin are not a GAAP financial measure of, nor does it imply, profitability. Even if our revenue exceeds variable expenses over time, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and the relationship of revenue to variable expenses is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin does not reflect all of our variable expenses and involves some judgment and discretion around what costs vary directly with loan volume. Other companies that present Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin calculate it differently and, therefore, similarly titled measures presented by other companies may not be directly comparable to ours.
The following table presents a reconciliation of income (loss) from operations to Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin:
_______
(1)Borrower acquisition costs were $61.7 million, $89.6 million and $91.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Borrower acquisition costs consist of our sales and marketing expenses adjusted to exclude costs not directly attributable to attracting a new borrower, such as payroll-related expenses for our business development and marketing teams, as well as other operational, brand awareness and marketing activities.
(2)Borrower verification and servicing costs were $13.7 million, $21.3 million and $31.8 million the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively. Borrower verification and servicing costs consist of payroll and other personnel-related expenses for personnel engaged in loan onboarding, verification and servicing, as well as servicing system costs. It excludes payroll and personnel-related expenses and stock-based compensation for certain members of our customer operations team whose work is not directly attributable to onboarding and servicing loans.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful for investors to use in comparing our financial performance with the performance of other companies for the following reasons:
•Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation, and interest expense, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing and capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired; and
•Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin eliminates the impact of certain items such as stock-based compensation expense and warrant expense that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business; and
•Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, and facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.
Our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:
•Although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;
•Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;
•Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and
•the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin when they report their operating results.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Upstart Holdings, Inc. common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin:

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share
We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) exclusive of stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share are useful measures for investors in evaluating our ability to generate earnings, more readily compare between past and future periods, and provide comparability of our performance with the performance of other companies.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have financed our operations, corporate investments, and capital expenditures primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock, term loans and draws on our revolving credit facilities, and cash generated from operations. We have also periodically issued convertible promissory notes, none of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. In December 2020, we completed our IPO which resulted in $167.4 million of proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, and before deducting deferred offering costs of $7.9 million. Deferred offering costs consisted primarily of incremental accounting, legal, and other fees related to the IPO.
Our outstanding debt consists of borrowings from term loan agreements, advances on our revolving credit facilities, including our warehouse credit facilities, and amounts borrowed under loan and security agreements to finance risk retention balances for certain unconsolidated securitizations we sponsor. As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate principal balance of $62.7 million outstanding, of which $20.5 million is due within the next 12 months. See “Note 7. Borrowings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
As of December 31, 2020, our primary source of liquidity was cash of $250.8 million. Changes in the balance of cash are generally a result of working capital fluctuations or the timing of purchases of loans facilitated through our platform. To finance purchases of certain loans facilitated through our platform, we rely on our warehouse credit facility, which allows us to borrow up to an aggregate of $100.0 million through the special-purpose trust, or the warehouse trust. Loans purchased by the trust are classified as held-for-sale and can be sold to third-party investors or in securitization transactions to generate additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, the amount borrowed under this credit facility was $35.0 million.
We believe that our cash on hand, funds available from our revolving credit facilities, amounts borrowed under our term loans, and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on multiple factors, including our revenue growth, working capital requirements, volume of loan purchases for product development purposes and our capital expenditures.
To the extent our cash balances, cash generated by operations, revolving credit facilities, term loans and the proceeds from our IPO are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs in the future, we may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely impacted.
Term Loans
In 2016, we, along with our wholly owned subsidiary, Upstart Network, Inc., or UNI, as the co-borrower, entered into a loan and security agreement, or LSA, with a third-party lender to obtain a term loan of $5.5 million. The term loan matured on December 1, 2020 and the Company paid in full the outstanding principal and the accrued interest.
In 2018, we entered into a mezzanine loan and security agreement with the same lender to obtain a second term loan of up to $15.0 million, or the Mezzanine Loan. The Mezzanine Loan bears interest at the greater of prime rate plus 5.25% or 10.00% per annum and matures on October 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of the Mezzanine Loan was $15.0 million.
Revolving Credit Facility
Our revolving credit facility has an aggregate credit limit of $5.5 million and as of December 31, 2020, we were fully drawn on such facility. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the parties agreed to extend the maturity date from June 1, 2020 to June 1, 2021 when the outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full. Our revolving credit facility bears floating interest rates, payable on a monthly basis, and contains certain financial covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants may result in an acceleration of payment on the outstanding principal and accrued interest. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by all assets of the company, excluding assets of consolidated securitizations and cash and restricted cash related to other borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants under our revolving credit facility.
Warehouse Credit Facilities
We have entered into two warehouse credit facilities with separate third-party lenders through our warehouse trusts, which are consolidated VIEs. On November 2, 2020, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under one of our warehouse credit facilities in the amount of $4.0 million and terminated the corresponding warehouse credit facility. The remaining warehouse facility is used to fund purchases of personal whole loans originated by certain bank partners on our platform; the assets of the warehouse trust secure the borrowings provided by the warehouse lender and are not available to settle claims of our general creditors. In May 2020, the maturity date of this credit facility, with a borrowing limit of $100.0 million, was extended to May 2022 when repayment of any outstanding principal, together with any accrued interest and unpaid interest, is due and payable. As of December 31, 2020, we have borrowed $35.0 million under this warehouse credit facility and may continue to borrow under this warehouse credit facility until May 2021. Our warehouse credit facility bears floating interest rates, payable on a monthly basis, and contain certain financial covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants may result in an acceleration of payment on outstanding principal and accrued interest. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants under our remaining warehouse credit facility.
Risk Retention Funding Loans
We obtained financing under two loan and security agreements to fund the purchase of securitization notes and residual certificates issued by certain of our consolidated VIEs in our sponsored securitization transactions. These purchases were made in the amounts required to satisfy the requirements of U.S. risk retention regulations. The loans under these agreements bear interest at rates of 4.00% and 4.33% per annum. Interest is paid using cash distributions received monthly on the related securitization notes and residual certificates held by these entities. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of these loans was $7.2 million. These
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
borrowings are solely obligations of these consolidated VIEs and are not available to satisfy potential claims of our creditors.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows during the years indicated:
Net Cash from Operating Activities
Our main sources of cash provided by operating activities are our revenue from fees earned under contracts with bank partners and loan investors and interest income we receive for loans held on our balance sheet.
Our main uses of cash in our operating activities include payments to marketing partners, vendor payments, payroll and other personnel-related expenses, payments for facilities, and other general business expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of a $32.1 million change in net operating assets and liabilities, offset by a change in fair value of financial instruments of $29.0 million, stock-based compensation of $11.5 million and net income before attribution to noncontrolling interests of $5.6 million. The change in fair value of financial instruments was primarily due to a $19.1 million decrease in the fair value of loans and a $6.5 million an increase in the fair value of preferred stock liabilities. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly related to a $116.1 million increase in purchases of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by $47.6 million of net proceeds from loans held-for-sale and $19.4 million increase in payable to investors.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily consisted of a net loss before attribution to noncontrolling interests of $5.0 million, offset by a change in fair value of financial instruments of $34.7 million. The change in fair value of financial instruments was primarily related to a $42.1 million decrease in the fair value of loans held-for-investment, partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in the fair value of payable to securitization note holders and residual certificate holders.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily consisted of a net loss before attribution to noncontrolling interests of $11.2 million, offset by a change in fair value of financial instruments of $42.3 million and a $14.0 million change in net operating assets and liabilities. The change in fair value of financial instruments was primarily related to a $45.8 million decrease in the fair value of loans held-for-investment. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly related to a $14.1 million increase in payable to investors.
Net Cash from Investing Activities
Our primary sources of cash from investing activities are principal repayments received on loans held-for-investment through credit facilities and held by consolidated securitizations, proceeds from the sale of loans and payments on residual certificates held for risk retention purposes in sponsored securitizations.
The primary use of cash for investing activities includes purchases of loans held-for investment, including loans collateralized in consolidated securitizations, as well as purchases of securitization notes and residual certificates to fulfill risk retention requirements in securitizations we have sponsored in the past.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $136.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of $97.3 million of net proceeds from sale of loans and $39.8 million of principal payments received for loans.
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Net cash provided by investing activities was $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of $207.0 million of principal payments received on loans and $100.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of loans, which were partially offset by $265.3 million in purchase of loans held-for-investment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of $421.1 million in purchases of loans, which was partially offset by $238.0 million in principal payments received on loans and $$45.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of loans.
Net Cash from Financing Activities
The main sources of cash from financing activities include proceeds from issuance of securitization notes and residual certificates from consolidated securitizations, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, and notes payable.
The primary uses of cash for financing activities include payments made to holders of securitization notes and residual certificates for consolidated securitizations and repayments of notes payable and borrowings.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of $159.5 million IPO proceeds net of underwriting discounts and deferred offering costs and $92.1 in proceeds from borrowings, which was partially offset by $174.2 million in payment on borrowings and securitization notes and certificates.
Net cash used in financing activities was $119.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of $199.4 million in payment on notes payable and securitization notes and certificates, which was partially offset by $43.6 million in net proceeds from borrowings and $39.9 million in proceeds from issuance of notes payable.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $135.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of $285.0 million in proceeds from issuance of notes payable and securitization notes and certificates, $51.1 million in net proceeds from borrowings and $49.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs, which were partially offset by $248.2 million in payment on notes payable and securitization notes and certificates.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Contractual Obligations
Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our loan purchase agreements, debt obligations related to our revolving credit facilities, term loans and risk retention funding loans, and operating leases for office spaces. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:
________
(1)Represents loans facilitated through our platform of which certain of our originating banks retain ownership for the duration of the holding period required by our contracts with the banks. This period is generally equal to three business days. We have committed to purchase the loans for the unpaid principal balance, plus accrued interest, at the conclusion of the required period.

For a discussion of our long-term debt obligations, operating lease obligations and loan repurchase agreement as of December 31, 2020, see “Note 7. Borrowings,” “Note 11. Leases,” and “Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies,” respectively, in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, we engage in activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities involve transactions with unconsolidated VIEs, including our sponsored and co-sponsored securitization transactions, which we contractually service. We use these transactions to provide a source of liquidity to finance our business and to diversify our investor base. When required by law, we retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the securities issued in these securitizations. We also engaged in activities with a personal loan trust entity created to facilitate fractional loan transactions. The fractional loan program was closed to new investments in 2019. We provide additional information regarding transactions with unconsolidated VIEs in “Note 3. Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
Our significant accounting policies are described in “Note 1. Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that the accounting policies described below reflect our most critical accounting policies and estimates, which represent those that involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these policies are critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial condition and results of operations.
Variable Interest Entities
A legal entity is considered a VIE if it either has a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity holders lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Our variable interest arises from contractual, ownership, or other monetary interests in the entity. We consolidate a VIE when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct activities that significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and we have the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
We are required to apply judgment in performing this assessment, including in identifying the activities that most significantly impact a VIE’s economic performance and determining significance of our obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits. Factors considered in assessing the significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held within the VIE’s capital structure; and the nature of or reason behind our interest in the entity.
We also apply judgment to determine whether decision-maker or service-provider fees are variable interests. Decision-maker or service-provider fees are not considered variable interests when the arrangement does not expose Upstart to risks of loss that a potential VIE was designed to pass on to its variable interest holders, the fees are commensurate, the arrangement is at market, and we do not have any other interests (including direct interests and certain indirect interests held through related parties) that absorb more than an insignificant amount of a VIE’s potential variability. Changes in our level of other interests in a potential VIE, such as those resulting from disposals of investments in securitization trusts serviced by us subsequent to the expiration of applicable risk retention requirements, can affect whether a decision-maker or service-provider fee is deemed a variable interest.
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
This determination can have a significant impact on our consolidation conclusions, as it could affect whether a legal entity is a VIE and whether Upstart is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
At a VIE’s inception, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based on the facts and circumstances. We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis.
Upstart has an ongoing contractual relationship with one of its VIEs, Upstart Loan Trust, which is a bankruptcy-remote special purpose borrowing entity. Upstart, from time to time and as-desired, sells loans to Upstart Loan Trust pursuant to a loan sale agreement, and services those loans from the time of transfer to Upstart Loan Trust until such loans are either charged-off or mature pursuant to a loan servicing agreement. Upstart Loan Trust borrows from one bank pursuant to a revolving credit and security agreement in order to finance the purchases of the loans from Upstart.
Upstart has also established a VIE special purpose trust, Upstart Loan Trust 2, that holds loans that have been repurchased by the Company following breaches of loan-level representations and warranties, or loans that are ineligible to finance through the warehouse trust. Upstart services the loans held by Upstart Loan Trust 2 until the loans are either charged-off or mature pursuant to a loan servicing agreement.
In connection with each securitization transaction prior to 2019-3, Upstart also established VIEs and grantor trusts pursuant to its sponsored securitization transactions involving the issuance of asset-backed securities, or ABS. Such VIEs or grantor trusts are respectively referred to elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K with the nomenclature Upstart Securitization Trust [Year]-[Number] and Upstart Funding Grantor Trust [Year]-[Number]. For such securitization transactions, we (along with certain other loan contributors that have previously purchased whole loans from us) sold Upstart-powered loans via a bankruptcy-remote intermediate entity to the issuing trust and then to the grantor trust. For each transaction, the grantor trust holds legal title to the loans and issues a collateral certificate representing the beneficial interest in such loans to the issuing trust. The issuing trust in turn issues various tranches of asset-backed securitization notes and certificates, which are purchased by one or more investment bank initial purchasers for resale to qualified institutional buyers and backed by the payments from the grantor trust to the issuing trust reflecting payments on the underlying securitized loans. Upstart, in addition to being party to various loan transfer agreements that facilitate the contribution of loans to the grantor trust, also services the loans held by each grantor trust from the time of transfer to the trust until the loans are charged off or mature pursuant to a loan servicing agreement.
In connection with each sponsored securitization transaction prior to 2019-3, Upstart facilitated the creation of a majority-owned affiliate, or MOA, which is a limited liability company and VIE. The purpose of these MOAs is to enable Upstart’s compliance with its risk retention obligations as a securitization sponsor pursuant to Regulation RR. Each MOA has held the requisite amount of ABS to comply with these obligations for the length of time required by the regulation. Upstart is party to the limited liability company agreement establishing each MOA. There were no MOAs set up for securitizations subsequent to 2019-2 as Upstart has not been subject to risk retention requirements for these deals.
Upstart has also established Upstart Network Trust, a special purpose entity that purchased loans from Upstart in which individual accredited investors in turn have purchased securities representing fractional interests in such purchased loans. Upstart, in addition to being party to a transfer agreement that facilitates the contribution of loans to Upstart Network Trust, services the loans held by Upstart Network Trust from the time of transfer until the loans are charged off or mature pursuant to a loan servicing agreement. Upstart Network Trust was closed to new investments as of the end of 2019.
Fair Value of Loans, Notes Receivable and Residual Certificates, and Payable to Securitization Note Holders and Residual Certificate Holders
We have elected the fair value option for loans and financial instruments related to securitization transactions, including notes receivable and residual certificates representing required risk retention for sponsored non-consolidated securitizations, and amounts payable to note holders and residual certificate holders in
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
consolidated securitizations. We believe the estimate of fair value of these financial instruments requires significant judgment. We use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. This model uses both observable and unobservable inputs and reflects our best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. Primary inputs that require significant judgment include discount rates, credit risk rates, and expected prepayment rates. These inputs are based on historical performance of loans facilitated through our platform, as well as the consideration of market participant requirements. See “Note 4. Fair Value Measurement” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K additional information.
Fair Value of Loan Servicing Assets and Liabilities
We also record loan servicing assets and liabilities at estimated fair value when we transfer loans which qualify as sales under Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing with servicing rights retained or when we enter into servicing agreements with banks partners that retain Upstart-powered loans. Loan servicing assets and liabilities are reported in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss on loan sale, as well as changes in the fair value of loan servicing assets and liabilities are reported in revenue from fees, net, on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which the changes occur. We use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair values of loan servicing assets and liabilities. The cash flows in the valuation model represent the difference between the servicing fees charged to loan investors and an estimated market servicing fee. Since servicing fees are generally based on the monthly unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans, the expected cash flows in the model incorporate estimated credit risk and expected prepayments on the loans. These inputs are consistent with the assumptions used in the valuation of loans held-for-investment and related securitization notes and residual certificates. See “Note 4. Fair Value Measurement” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue consists of two components: revenue from fees, net and interest income and fair value adjustments, net.
Revenue From Fees, Net
The revenue from fees, net line item on the consolidated statements of operations is primarily comprised of platform and referral fees, net, which are recognized based on Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). We adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The adoption of Topic 606 had no material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statement of cash flows as of the adoption date or for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle, involving a five-step process, of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Our arrangements for platform and referral services typically consist of an obligation to provide one or both of these services to customers on a when and if needed basis (a stand-ready obligation), and we recognize revenue as such services are performed, which coincides with the amount billable to the customer. Additionally, the services have the same pattern and period of transfer, and when provided individually or together, are accounted for as a single combined performance obligation representing a series of distinct days of service.
Our platform and referral fees represent variable consideration. Since the variable fees relate directly to the day the service is provided, they generally meet the criteria for allocating variable consideration entirely to one or
Upstart Holdings, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract. Accordingly, when the requisite criteria are met, variable fees are allocated to and recognized on the day the services are provided.
We also charge an ongoing loan servicing fee to the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) based on a predetermined percentage of the outstanding principal balance. Loan servicing fees are recognized in the period the services are provided. Servicing fees, net also includes gains and losses on assets and liabilities recognized under loan servicing arrangements for loans retained by bank partners or loans sold to institutional investors. Such gains or losses are recognized based on whether the benefits of servicing are expected to more than adequately compensate us for carrying out our servicing obligations. Servicing fees also include changes in fair value of loan servicing assets and liabilities in the periods presented.
Interest Income and Fair Value Adjustments, Net
Interest income and fair value adjustments, net is comprised of interest income, interest expense and net changes in fair value of financial instruments from our normal course of business held at fair value, including loans, notes receivable and residual certificates, and payable to securitization note holders and residual certificate holders. We record these adjustments in earnings in the period incurred and include both realized and unrealized adjustments to the value of related assets and liabilities. See the subsection titled “Fair Value of Loans, Notes Receivable and Residual Certificates, and Payable to Securitization Note Holders and Residual Certificate Holders” above for further details on the estimates of fair value of these assets and liabilities.
Stock-Based Compensation
We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock options that is expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period of the respective awards.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the grant date fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:
•Fair Value of Common Stock-Prior to the completion of our IPO, the fair value was determined by the Company’s Board of Directors as there was no public market for the Company’s common stock. The Board of Directors determined the fair value of the common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including: third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock, the valuation of comparable companies, the Company’s operating and financial performance, and general and industry specific economic outlook, among other factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
•Expected Term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We determined the expected term for employee stock options based on historical terminations and exercise behavior, which factors in an extended post-termination exercise provision for vested awards for certain employees who provide more than three years of service. We use the contractual term for all nonemployee awards.
•Expected Volatility-Since we have limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average historical volatilities of common stock of comparable publicly traded entities over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
• Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the stock option award.
•Expected Dividend-We have never paid dividends on our common stock since our inception, nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
See “Note 10. Equity Incentive Plans” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our stock options granted in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Such assumptions involved inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different.
Stock-based compensation expense was $2.0 million, $3.8 million, and $11.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had $15.3 million and $35.3 million, respectively, of total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years and 2.8 years, respectively. These amounts reflect our reassessment of the fair value of our common stock in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See “Note 1. Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as December 31, 2020.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The JOBS Act does not preclude an emerging growth company from early adopting a new or revised accounting standard earlier than the time that such standard applies to private companies. We early adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) effective January 1, 2019 and have elected not to restate comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. We expect to use the extended transition period for any other new or revised accounting.
