ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
We have made forward-looking statements in this document, and in documents that we incorporate by reference, that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the Company, the Bank, First Citizens Insurance, Realty or the Company on a consolidated basis. When we use words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may prove inaccurate. For a variety of reasons, actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by forward-looking statements:
• The scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and may have an adverse effect on our business and operations, our customers, including their ability to make timely loan payments, our service providers, and on the economy and financial markets more significant that we expect.
• Interest rates could change more rapidly or more significantly than we expect.
• The economy could change significantly in an unexpected way, which would cause the demand for new loans and the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans to change in ways that our models do not anticipate.
• The financial markets could suffer a significant disruption, which may have a negative effect on our financial condition and that of our borrowers, and on our ability to raise money by issuing new securities.
• It could take us longer than we anticipate implementing strategic initiatives, including expansions, designed to increase revenues or manage expenses, or we may be unable to implement those initiatives at all.
• Acquisitions and dispositions of assets could affect us in ways that management has not anticipated.
• We may become subject to new legal obligations or the resolution of litigation may have a negative effect on our financial condition or operating results.
• We may become subject to new and unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory or compliance practices or requirements. Failure to comply with any one or more of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations.
• We could experience greater loan delinquencies than anticipated, adversely affecting our earnings and financial condition.
• We could experience greater losses than expected due to the ever increasing volume of information theft and fraudulent scams impacting our customers and the banking industry.
• We could lose the services of some or all of our key personnel, which would negatively impact our business because of their business development skills, financial expertise, lending experience, technical expertise and market area knowledge.
• The agricultural economy is subject to extreme swings in both the costs of resources and the prices received from the sale of products as a result of weather, government regulations, international trade agreements and consumer tastes, which could negatively impact certain of our customers.
• Loan concentrations in certain industries could negatively impact our results, if financial results or economic conditions deteriorate.
• A budget impasse in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania could impact our asset values, liquidity and profitability as a result of either delayed or reduced funding to school districts and municipalities who are customers of the bank.
• Companies providing support services related to the exploration and drilling of the natural gas reserves in our market area may be affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes and environmental protection, which could negatively impact our customers and, as a result, negatively impact our loan and deposit volume and loan quality. Additionally, the activities the companies providing support services related to the exploration and drilling of the natural gas reserves may be dependent on the market price of natural gas. As a result, decreases in the market price of natural gas could also negatively impact these companies, our customers.
Additional factors are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date of the forward-looking statements or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Accordingly, past results and trends should not be used by investors to anticipate future results or trends.

INTRODUCTION
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of the significant changes in financial condition, the results of operations, capital resources and liquidity presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Company. The Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of the Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. Management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. Except as noted, tabular information is presented in thousands of dollars.
The Company currently engages in the general business of banking throughout its service area of Bradford, Tioga, Clinton, Potter and Centre counties in north central Pennsylvania, Lebanon, Berks, Schuylkill and Lancaster counties in south central Pennsylvania and Allegany County in southern New York. We also have a limited branch office in Union county, Pennsylvania, which primarily serves agricultural customers in the central Pennsylvania market. We maintain our main office in Mansfield, Pennsylvania. Presently we operate 33 banking facilities, 31 of which operate as bank branches after closing a facility in the first quarter of 2020 and opening a facility in the fourth quarter of 2020. In Pennsylvania, the Company has full service offices located in Mansfield, Blossburg, Ulysses, Genesee, Wellsboro, Troy, Sayre, Canton, Gillett, Millerton, LeRaysville, Towanda, Rome, the Mansfield Wal-Mart Super Center, Mill Hall, Schuylkill Haven, Friedensburg, Mt. Aetna, Fredericksburg, Mount Joy, Fivepointville, State College and two branches near the city of Lebanon, Pennsylvania after closing a third branch in January 2020. We also have a limited branch office in Winfield, Pennsylvania. In November of 2020, we opened a full service branch in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. In New York, our office is in Wellsville. There are two branches in Wilmington Delaware, one branch in Dover Delaware, and a corporate administration building in Wilmington, Delaware, which were acquired as part of the MidCoast acquisition in April 2020.
Risk identification and management are essential elements for the successful management of the Company. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various types of risk, including interest rate, credit, liquidity, reputational and regulatory risk.
Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of financial instruments to the direction and frequency of changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk results from various re-pricing frequencies and the maturity structure of the financial instruments owned by the Company. The Company uses its asset/liability and funds management policies to control and manage interest rate risk.
Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk results from loans with customers and the purchasing of securities. The Company’s primary credit risk is in the loan portfolio. The Company manages credit risk by adhering to an established credit policy and through a disciplined evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Also, the investment policy limits the amount of credit risk that may be taken in the investment portfolio.
Liquidity risk represents the inability to generate or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers and obligations to depositors. The Company has established guidelines within its asset/liability and funds management policy to manage liquidity risk. These guidelines include, among other things, contingent funding alternatives.
Index
Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information, which could include identify theft, or theft of customer information through third parties. We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.
Regulatory risk represents the possibility that a change in law, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the business of the Company and its subsidiary. We cannot predict what legislation might be enacted or what regulations might be adopted, or if adopted, the effect thereof on our operations.
Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents the Company files with the SEC, including the annual reports on Form 10-K, the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any current reports on Form 8-K filed by us.
TRUST AND INVESTMENT SERVICES; OIL AND GAS SERVICES
Our Investment and Trust Division is committed to helping our customers meet their financial goals.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $25,103,000, which represents an increase of $5,613,000, or 28.8%, when compared to 2019. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $19,490,000, which represents an increase of $1,456,000, or 8.1%, when compared to 2018. Basic earnings per share were $6.60, $5.48 and $5.04 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, while diluted earnings per share were $6.59, $5.47 and $5.04, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Net income is influenced by five key components: net interest income, provision for loan losses, non-interest income, non-interest expenses, and the provision for income taxes.
Net Interest Income
The most significant source of revenue is net interest income; the amount by which interest earned on interest-earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Factors that influence net interest income are changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as changes in the associated interest rates.
The following table sets forth the Company’s average balances of, and the interest earned or incurred on, each principal category of assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity, the related rates, net interest income and rate “spread” created. The acquisition of MidCoast, which closed on April 17, 2020, impacted the average balances and rates for 2020 when compared to 2019:
Index
(1) Averages are based on daily averages.
(2) Includes loan origination and commitment fees.
(3) Tax exempt interest revenue is shown on a tax equivalent basis for proper comparison using a statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Tax equivalent income is considered a non-gaap measure. See reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measure on page 30.
(4) Income on non-accrual loans is accounted for on a cash basis, and the loan balances are included in interest-earning assets.
(5) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
Index
For purposes of the comparison, as well as the discussion that follows, this presentation facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax-free assets by increasing the tax-free income by an amount equivalent to the Federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the Federal statutory rate for the corresponding year. Accordingly, tax equivalent adjustments for investments and loans have been made accordingly to the previous table for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands):
The following table shows the tax-equivalent effect of changes in volume and rates on interest income and expense (in thousands):
(1) The portion of the total change attributable to both volume and rate changes during the year has been allocated to volume and rate components based upon the absolute dollar amount of the change in each component prior to allocation.
Index
2020 vs. 2019
Tax equivalent net interest income for 2020 was $63,351,000 compared to $51,088,000 for 2019, an increase of $12,263,000 or 24.0%. Total interest income increased $8,328,000, as loan interest income increased $8,539,000, and total investment income decreased $211,000. Interest expense decreased $3,935,000 from 2019.
Total tax equivalent interest income from investment securities decreased $205,000 in 2020 from 2019. The average balance of investment securities increased $21.0 million, which had an effect of increasing interest income by $602,000 due to volume. The majority of the increase in volume was in tax-exempt securities, which experienced an increase in the average balance of $21.5 million. The average tax-effected yield on our investment portfolio decreased from 2.85% in 2019 to 2.55% in 2020. The decrease in the tax-effected yield is attributable to purchases made in a lower rate environment and calls in the third quarter of 2019 of securities purchased at a discount. As a result of the yield on investment securities decreasing 30 basis points (bps) to 2.55%, interest income on investment securities decreased $807,000, with the decrease primarily related to taxable securities. The investment strategy for 2020 has been to utilize cashflows from the investment portfolio and deposit inflows to purchase mortgage backed securities in government sponsored entities and obligations of state and political securities, as well as US agency securities. The increase in the investment portfolio was in response to growth in deposits that exceeded organic loan opportunities. The Covid-19 pandemic did provide opportunities for the Company to purchase high quality municipal securities and mortgage backed securities with relatively high spreads in the first and second quarters of 2020. Purchases in the second half of 2020 were reflective of tighter spreads and lower yields due government stimulus and its impact on bond markets and deposit levels. We continually monitor interest rate trading ranges and try to focus purchases to times when rates are in the top of the trading range. The Bank believes its investment strategy has appropriately mitigated its interest rate risk exposure for various rate environments, while providing sufficient cashflows to meet liquidity needs.
In total, loan interest income increased $8,539,000 in 2020 from 2019. The average balance of our loan portfolio increased by $189.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019, which resulted in an increase in interest income of $9,880,000 due to volume. The increase in the average balance of loans was driven by the MidCoast acquisition in the first quarter of 2020 and the PPP program authorized by the SBA in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Organic growth in the first three quarters of 2020, excluding the PPP program was limited, but did increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily in our Delaware market. The average tax-effected yield on our loan portfolio decreased 8 basis points to 4.97% in 2020, resulting in a decrease in loan interest income of $1,341,000. The decrease in the tax-effected yield was due to the lower rate environment promoted by the Federal Reserve in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Interest income on residential mortgage loans decreased $312,000. The average balance of residential mortgage loans decreased $5.1 million, resulting in a decrease of $263,000 due to volume. The decrease in loans is due to loans being refinanced and sold on the secondary market. The change due to rate was a decrease of $49,000 as the average yield on residential mortgages decreased from 5.32% in 2019 to 5.30% in 2020 as a result of the lower rate environment during the year as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.
• The average balance of construction loans increased $7.3 million from 2019 to 2020 as a result of the acquisition and projects in our south central Pennsylvania market, which resulted in an increase of $353,000 in interest income. The average yield on construction loans decreased from 5.16% to 4.89%, which correlated to a $49,000 decrease in interest income.
• Interest income on commercial loans increased $8,346,000 from 2019 to 2020. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans of $174.8 million is attributable to the MidCoast acquisition and PPP loans originated in the second and third quarters of 2020. The increase in the average balance of these loans resulted in an increase in interest income due to volume of $9,164,000. Our lenders have been able to attract and retain loan relationships in their markets by providing excellent customer service and having attractive products. We believe our lenders are adept at customizing and structuring loans to customers that meet their needs and satisfy our commitment to credit quality. In many cases, the Bank works with the Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loan programs to offset risk and to further promote economic growth in our market area. The average yield on commercial loans decreased 21 basis points to 5.26% in 2020, resulting in a decrease in interest income due to rate of $818,000.
Index
• Interest income on agricultural loans increased $143,000 from 2019 to 2020. The increase in the average balance of agricultural loans of $12.6 million is primarily attributable to the central and south central markets as well as the acquisition. The increase in the average balance of these loans resulted in an increase in interest income due to volume of $524,000. The average yield on agricultural loans decreased from 4.61% in 2019 to 4.49% in 2020 due to a general decrease in rates, resulting in a decrease in interest income due to rate of $381,000. We believe our lenders are adept at customizing, understanding and have the expertise to structure loans for customers that meet their needs and satisfy our commitment to credit quality. In many cases, the Bank works with the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) guaranteed loan programs to offset risk and to further promote economic growth in our market area.
• The average balance of loans to state and political subdivisions decreased $11.6 million from 2019 to 2020 which had a negative impact of $471,000 on total interest income due to volume. The average tax equivalent yield on loans to state and political subdivisions increased from 3.93% in 2019 to 4.01% in 2020, increasing interest income by $84,000.
• The average balance of other loans increased $11.3 million as a result of an increase in outstanding student loans. This resulted in an increase of $573,000 on total interest income due to volume. The average tax equivalent yield on other loans decreased from 7.64% in 2019 to 5.65% in 2020 as a result of the growth in student loans, decreasing interest income by $128,000 in student loans
Total interest expense decreased $3,935,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. The majority of the decrease was due to a decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of 45 basis points to 0.64%. This decrease resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $5,212,000. The decrease in rates was driven by the Federal Reserve decreasing rates in the second half of 2019 as a result of a slowing economy and the in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average rate on certificates of deposit decreased from 1.49% to 1.23% resulting in a decrease in interest expense of $300,000. The average rate paid on other borrowed funds decreased from 2.59% to 1.34% resulting in a decrease in interest expense of $1,207,000. The average rate paid on money market accounts decreased from 1.20% to 0.49% resulting in a decrease in interest expense of $1,652,000. The average rate paid on NOW accounts decreased from 0.69% in 2019 to 0.29% in 2020 resulting in a decrease in interest expense of $1,624,000. The average rate paid on savings accounts decreased 17 bps and resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $429,000.
Average interest bearing liabilities increased $167.1 million in 2020, with average interest bearing deposits increasing $182.9 million and average other borrowings decreasing $15.8 million. As a result of the increase in average deposits, interest expense increased $1,277,000 as result of the change in volume. Increases in average deposits, which were primarily driven by the MidCoast acquisition, included NOW accounts of $52.0 million, savings accounts of $23.2 million, money market accounts of $40.3 million and certificates of deposits of $67.5 million The combined impact to interest expense of these increases was $1,637,000. The average balance of other borrowed funds decreased $15.8 million, which corresponds to a decrease in interest expense of $360,000.
Our tax equivalent net interest margin for 2020 was 3.92% compared to 3.72% for 2019, with the change attributable to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreasing more than income from interest earning assets during 2020. The interest rate environment for 2020 was flat for a majority of the year, but did experience some expansion in the fourth quarter of 2020 with long term rates rising, while short term rates remained low. Should short or long-term interest rates move in such a way that results in a further flattening or inversion, we would anticipate additional pressure on our margin.
Index
2019 vs. 2018
Tax equivalent net interest income for 2019 was $51,088,000 compared to $48,375,000 for 2018, an increase of $2,713,000 or 5.6%. Total interest income increased $5,179,000, as loan interest income increased $4,477,000, and total investment income increased $614,000. Interest expense increased $2,466,000 from 2018.
Total tax equivalent interest income from investment securities increased $614,000 in 2019 from 2018. The average balance of investment securities decreased $9.4 million, which was used to fund loan growth, which had an effect of decreasing interest income by $271,000 due to volume. The majority of the decrease in volume was in tax-exempt securities, which experienced a decrease in the average balance of $6.1 million. The average tax-effected yield on our investment portfolio increased from 2.51% in 2018 to 2.85% in 2019. The increase in the tax-effected yield is attributable to purchases made in a higher rate environment and calls in 2019 of securities purchased at a discount. As a result of yield on taxable securities increasing 53 basis points (bps) to 2.74%, interest income on investment securities increased $885,000.
In total, loan interest income increased $4,477,000 in 2019 from 2018. The average balance of our loan portfolio increased by $58.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018, which resulted in an increase in interest income of $2,917,000 due to volume. The increase in the average balance of loans was driven by growth in our central and south central Pennsylvania markets. The average tax-effected yield on our loan portfolio increased 15 basis points to 5.05% in 2019, resulting in an increase in loan interest income of $1,560,000. The increase in the tax-effected yield was due to the higher rate environment promoted by the Federal Reserve in 2018 through the four rate increases made in 2018, which were partially offset by two rate decreases in 2019.
• Interest income on residential mortgage loans increased $268,000. The average balance of residential mortgage loans increased $1.3 million, resulting in an increase of $68,000 due to volume. The change due to rate was an increase of $200,000 as the average yield on residential mortgages increased from 5.22% in 2018 to 5.32% in 2019 as a result of a higher rate environment during the year as a result of rate increases in 2018.
• The average balance of construction loans decreased $6.6 million from 2018 to 2019 as projects were completed, which resulted in a decrease of $350,000 in interest income. The average yield on construction loans increased from 4.80% to 5.16%, which correlated to a $99,000 increase in interest income.
• Interest income on commercial loans increased $2,130,000 from 2018 to 2019. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans of $27.6 million is attributable to organic growth in the central and south central markets as well as completed construction projects. The increase in the average balance of these loans resulted in an increase in interest income due to volume of $1,500,000. The average yield on commercial loans increased 16 basis points to 5.47% in 2019, resulting in an increase in interest income due to rate of $630,000.
• Interest income on agricultural loans increased $2,241,000 from 2018 to 2019. The increase in the average balance of agricultural loans of $39.6 million is primarily attributable to the central and south central markets as well as completed construction projects. The increase in the average balance of these loans resulted in an increase in interest income due to volume of $1,814,000. The average yield on agricultural loans increased from 4.47% in 2018 to 4.61% in 2019 due to a general increase in rates, resulting in an increase in interest income due to rate of $427,000.
• The average balance of loans to state and political subdivisions decreased $3.7 million from 2018 to 2019 which had a negative impact of $124,000 on total interest income due to volume. The average tax equivalent yield on loans to state and political subdivisions increased from 3.70% in 2018 to 3.93% in 2019, increasing interest income by $210,000.
Index
Total interest expense increased $2,466,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of 20 basis points to 1.09%. This increase resulted in an increase in interest expense of $2,538,000. The rise in rates was driven by the Federal Reserve raising short term rates in 2018, which increased pressure on the Bank to raise rates on deposit pricing and to pay higher rates for short-term and overnight borrowings. While the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2019, the cuts were less than the increases in 2018, but did have an impact in lowering rates in the second half of 2019. The average rate on certificates of deposit increased from 1.20% to 1.49% resulting in an increase in interest expense of $797,000. The average rate paid on other borrowed funds increased from 2.26% to 2.59% resulting in an increase in interest expense of $327,000. The average rate paid on money market accounts increased from 0.98% to 1.20% resulting in an increase in interest expense of $361,000. Increases in rates paid on NOW accounts and savings accounts were less than 20 basis points, and resulted in a cumulative increase in interest expense of $1,053,000.
Average interest bearing liabilities increased $24.2 million in 2019, with average interest bearing deposits increasing $33.1 million and average other borrowings decreasing $8.9 million. As a result of the decrease in average borrowings, interest expense decreased $72,000 as result of the change in volume. Increases in average deposits included NOW accounts of $5.7 million, savings accounts of $25.5 million and certificates of deposits of $1.7 million. The combined impact to interest expense of these increases was $98,000. The average balance of other borrowed funds decreased $8.9 million, which corresponds to a decrease in interest expense of $170,000.
Our tax equivalent net interest margin for 2019 was 3.72% compared to 3.66% for 2018, with the change attributable to higher tax-effected yields as a result of the higher rate environment.
PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2,400,000. The provision for 2020 was $725,000, or 43.3%, higher than the provision in 2019. The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our economy as well as organic growth attributable to the Delaware market primarily in the fourth quarter of 2020 (see also “Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality Risk”).
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,675,000. The provision for 2019 was $250,000, or 13.0% lower than the provision in 2018. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily the result of organic loan growth in 2019 being less than the organic loan growth experienced in 2018 (see also “Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality Risk”).
NON-INTEREST INCOME
The following table reflects non-interest income by major category for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):
Index
2020 vs. 2019
Non-interest income increased $3,036,000 in 2020 from 2019, or 36.2%. We experienced a $305,000 net gain on available for sale securities in 2020 compared to net gains totaling $24,000 in 2019. During 2020, we sold 19 mortgage backed securities for a net gain of $305,000 to lock in gains that benefitted from the Federal Reserve investment purchase program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2019, we sold 3 agency securities for a net gain of $1,000 and 4 US Treasury securities for a gain of $23,000 to fund loan growth and to restructure the investment portfolio to improve performance in the current rate environment. During 2020, net equity security losses amounted to $41,000 as a result of market losses associated with the Covid-19 pandemic compared to gains of $120,000 last year.
Gains on loans sold increased $1,695,000 compared to last year. The increase in gains on loans sold is attributable to a $54.0 million, or 248.1% increase in the proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages loans as a result of the low rate environment, which has significantly increased residential refinancings. The decrease in service charges of $466,000 for 2020 is attributable to the Bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease in customer spending as a result of mandatory stay at home orders as customers ate out less and spent less on discretionary items. The increase in other income is due to fees on offering derivative contracts for certain customers, that provided the customer with fixed rate loans, which generated fee income of $1,373,000 in 2020. The increase in brokerage and insurance commissions was primarily attributable to growth in our south central market.
2019 vs. 2018
Non-interest income increased $651,000 in 2019 from 2018, or 8.4%. We experienced a $24,000 net gain on available for sale securities in 2019 compared to a net loss totaling $19,000 in 2018. During 2019, we sold 3 agency securities for a net gain of $1,000 and 4 US Treasury securities for a gain of $23,000 to fund loan growth and to restructure the investment portfolio to improve performance in the current rate environment. During 2018, we sold 7 agency securities for a net loss of $179,000 and 14 municipal securities for a gain of $160,000 to fund loan growth. As a result of market conditions, the equity portfolio increased $120,000 during 2019, while remaining flat in 2018.
Gains on loans sold increased $91,000 compared to last year. During 2019, the Bank generated $21.8 million of residential mortgage loan sale proceeds, which was $2.1 million, or 10.6% more than the proceeds received in 2018.
The increase in brokerage and insurance commissions was primarily attributable to growth in our south central market. The increase in Trust fees is due to estate settlement fees being higher in 2019 than 2018.

Non-interest Expenses
The following tables reflect the breakdown of non-interest expense by major category for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):
2020 vs. 2019
Non-interest expenses for 2020 totaled $40,847,000, which represents an increase of $7,506,000, compared to 2019 expenses of $33,341,000. The primary cause of the total increase was the MidCoast acquisition costs, as well as the additional salaries and benefits costs of the acquired employees. Salary and benefit costs increased $3,734,000, or 18.3%. Base salaries and related payroll taxes increased $3,081,000 as a result of merit increases and additional headcount associated with the acquisition. Full time equivalent staffing was 281 and 259 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Profit sharing expenses increased $829,000 compared to 2019, as a result of the employee mix and increased profitability, which will result in higher bonuses to employees.
The increase in occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses was due to the additional branches acquired as part of the MidCoast acquisition. The increase in merger and acquisition expenses was due to costs associated with the MidCoast acquisition that closed in April 2020. The increase in FDIC insurance in 2020 was due to credits received from the FDIC in 2019 as the Deposit Insurance Fund exceeded 1.38% as well as organic and acquisition growth that occurred in 2020. The increase in software expenses is due to new systems implemented in the second half of 2020 for our tellers and image capture and review. The largest drivers of the increase in other expenses was the termination of a pension plan in 2019 for a gain that was acquired as of the FNB acquisition in 2015, ATM and data processing expenses as a result of fraud prevention, contributions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, supplies for the additional branches and the Delaware franchise fee. The increase in ORE expenses is the result of net losses on the disposal of ORE properties in 2020 compared to a net gain in 2019.
Index
2019 vs. 2018
Non-interest expenses for 2019 totaled $33,341,000, which represents an increase of $1,784,000, compared to 2018 expenses of $31,557,000. The primary cause of the total increase was salaries and benefits. Salary and benefit costs increased $1,362,000, or 7.1%. Base salaries and related payroll taxes increased $200,000 as a result of merit increases. Full time equivalent staffing was 259 and 261 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result of actual claims utilization, health insurance related expenses increased $395,000. Retirement and profit sharing expenses increased $539,000 compared to 2018, as a result of the employee mix and increased profitability.
The increase in furniture and fixtures was due to computer upgrades made during 2019. The increase in merger and acquisition expenses is due to costs associated with the merger with MidCoast Community Bancorp, Inc. and no corresponding activity in 2018. The increase in ORE expenses is the result of having additional ORE properties in 2019 than 2018 that were acquired as part of the customer bankruptcy settlement that resulted in the decreased professional fees. The largest drivers of the increase in other expenses was operational charge-offs associated with fraudulent activity, ATM and data processing expenses as a result of fraud prevention and advertising and promotion expenses. The decrease in professional and legal fees is due to a decrease in legal fees associated with a customer’s bankruptcy litigation that was settled in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in FDIC insurance was due to credits received in 2019 from the FDIC as the Deposit Insurance Fund exceeded 1.38%.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $5,263,000, $3,820,000 and $3,403,000 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 17.3%, 16.4% and 15.9%, respectively.
The increase in income tax expense of $1,443,000 in 2020 was due to the increase of $7,056,000 in income before the provision for income taxes, which accounts for an increase in tax expense of $1,482,000 at a 21% tax rate.
The increase in income tax expense of $417,000 in 2019 was due to the increase of $1,873,000 in income before the provision for income taxes, which accounts for an increase in tax expense of $393,000 at a 21% tax rate. The remaining increase was due to a lower amount of tax exempt income in 2019 compared to 2018.
We are involved in four limited partnership agreements that operate low-income housing projects in our market area. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized tax credits related to one of the four partnerships. Tax credits associated with one project became fully utilized in December 2016. The tax credits for the other two projects were fully utilized by December 31, 2012. We anticipate recognizing an aggregate of $282,000 of tax credits over the next two years.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The following table presents ending balances (dollars in millions), the dollar amount of change and the percentage change during the past two years:
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $68.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2019. Management actively measures and evaluates its liquidity through our Asset - Liability committee and believes its liquidity needs are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional funding sources, Federal Home Loan Bank financing, federal funds lines with correspondent banks, brokered certificates of deposit and the portion of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year. Management expects that these sources of funds will permit us to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they come due.
Index
Investments
The following table shows the year-end composition of the investment portfolio, at fair value, for the five years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):
(a) As of January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 resulting in the reclassification of equity securities from available for sale securities to equity securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s investment portfolio increased during 2020 by $55.7 million. This growth was fueled by increases in deposits that were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic as customers received government stimulus money and held more cash, and limited loan growth opportunities during the first nine months of 2020. During 2020, we purchased $31.2 million of U.S. agencies, $54.5 million of mortgage backed securities, $55.1 million of state and local obligations, $3.2 million of corporate obligations and $1.3 million of equity securities, which helped to offset the $21.6 million of principal repayments and $48.4 million of calls and maturities that occurred during the year. We also sold $23.4 million of bonds at a net gain of $305,000. The fair value of our investment portfolio increased approximately $4.7 million in 2020 due to interest rate fluctuations and equity market losses. Excluding our short term investments consisting of monies held primarily at the Federal Reserve, the effective yield on our investment portfolio for 2020 was 2.55% compared to 2.85% for 2019 on a tax equivalent basis.
During 2020, interest rates across the yield curve decreased significantly due to the Federal Reserves rate cuts on the short end and the markets reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. For a majority of the year, the Treasury yield curve was relatively flat and yields were near historical lows. Late in 2020, the long end of the curve increased slightly adding some spread to the Treasury curve, but overall yields remain low from a historical perspective. The investment strategy for 2020 has been to utilize cashflows from the investment portfolio and deposit inflows to purchase mortgage backed securities in government sponsored entities and obligations of state and political securities, as well as US agency securities. The increase in the investment portfolio was in response to growth in deposits that exceeds organic loan opportunities. We continually monitor interest rate trading ranges and try to focus purchases to times when rates are in the top third of the trading range. The Company believes its investment strategy has appropriately mitigated its interest rate risk exposure if rates rise while providing sufficient cashflows for the Company’s liquidity needs.
At December 31, 2020, the Company did not own any securities, other than government-sponsored and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, that had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of its consolidated stockholders’ equity at that date.
Index
The expected principal repayments at amortized cost and average weighted yields for the investment portfolio (excluding equity securities) as of December 31, 2020, are shown below (dollars in thousands). Expected principal repayments, which include prepayment speed assumptions for mortgage-backed securities, are significantly different than the contractual maturities detailed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. Yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis, assuming a 21% tax rate, which was the rate in effect at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 78.5% of the amortized cost of debt securities is expected to mature, call or pre-pay within five years or less. The Company expects that earnings from operations, the levels of cash held at the Federal Reserve and other correspondent banks, the high liquidity level of the available-for-sale securities, growth of deposits and the availability of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and other third party banks will be sufficient to meet future liquidity needs.
The Company’s investment portfolio remained stable during 2019 as the Company maintained investment levels for pledging against public deposits and liquidity needs. During 2019, we purchased $14.1 million of U.S. agencies, $26.2 million of mortgage backed securities, $28.4 million of state and local obligations, $250,000 of corporate obligations and $65,000 of equity securities, which helped to offset the $9.8 million of principal repayments and $52.8 million of calls and maturities that occurred during the year. We also sold $10.5 million of bonds at a net gain of $24,000. The market value of our investment portfolio increased approximately $4.2 million in 2019 due to interest rate fluctuations and equity market gains. Excluding our short term investments consisting of monies held primarily at the Federal Reserve, the effective yield on our investment portfolio for 2019 was 2.85% compared to 2.51% for 2018 on a tax equivalent basis.
During 2019, rates on the short end of the Treasury yield curve decreased as a result of the decrease in the federal funds rate and the potential for additional future decreases in the federal funds rate. The rates on the long end of the curve also decreased in 2019 primarily as a result of continued low inflation. This resulted in yield curve remaining very flat and during parts of 2019, portions of the yield curve were inverted. The investment strategy in 2019 was to maintain a consistent balance to meet public deposit pledging needs as well as to meet the Company’s liquidity needs. Investment purchases during the year focused on securities with short fixed maturities for agency securities, high coupon callable municipal securities that are highly likely to be called and mortgage backed securities with consistent cashflows.
At December 31, 2019, the Company did not own any securities, other than government-sponsored and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, that had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of its consolidated stockholders’ equity at that date.
Loans Held for Sale
Loans held for sale increased $13.8 million to $14.6 million as of December 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019. The increase in loans held for sale was due to the amount of refinancings occurring due to the low rate environment.
Index
Loans
The Bank’s lending efforts have historically focused on north central Pennsylvania and southern New York. With the acquisition of FNB and the opening of offices in Lancaster County, this focus has grown to include Lebanon, Schuylkill, Berks and Lancaster County markets of south central, Pennsylvania. We have a limited branch office in Union County that is staffed by a lending team to primarily support agricultural opportunities in central Pennsylvania. In December 2017, we completed a branch acquisition in State College, which provides us with opportunities in Centre County, Pennsylvania. In April 2020, we completed the MidCoast acquisition, which expanded our markets into the State of Delaware with activity centered around the cities of Wilmington and Dover, Delaware. In November of 2020, we opened a branch in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, to further serve customers obtained as part of the MidCoast acquisition, as well as to expand operations into Chester County, Pennsylvania.
We originate loans primarily through direct loans to our existing customer base, with new customers generated through the strong relationships that our lending teams have with their customers, as well as by referrals from real estate brokers, building contractors, attorneys, accountants, corporate and advisory board members, existing customers and the Bank’s website. The Bank offers a variety of loans, although historically most of our lending has focused on real estate loans including residential, commercial, agricultural, and construction loans. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 81.7% of our loan portfolio consisted of real estate loans. All lending is governed by a lending policy that is developed and administered by management and approved by the Board of Directors.
The Bank primarily offers fixed rate residential mortgage loans with terms of up to 25 years and adjustable rate mortgage loans (with amortization schedules up to 30 years) with interest rates and payments that adjust based on one, three, five and 15 year fixed periods. Loan to value ratios are usually 80% or less with exceptions for individuals with excellent credit and low debt to income and/or high net worth. Adjustable rate mortgages are tied to a margin above the comparable Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh borrowing rate. Home equity loans are written with terms of up to 15 years at fixed rates. Home equity lines of credit are variable rate loans tied to the Prime Rate generally with a ten year draw period followed by a ten year repayment period. Home equity loans are typically written with a maximum 80% loan to value.
Commercial real estate loan terms are generally 20 years or less, with one to five year adjustable interest rates. The adjustable rates are typically tied to a margin above the comparable Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh borrowing rate with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80%. During 2020, the Bank began offering certain customers derivative contracts that allowed the customer to obtain a fixed interest rate for a period up to 10 years. Where feasible, the Bank participates in the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) and Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loan programs to offset risk and to further promote economic growth in our market area.
Agriculture is an important industry throughout our market areas. Therefore, the Bank has not only developed an agriculture lending team with significant experience that has a thorough understanding of this industry, but also continually looks for additional employees with a thorough understanding of agriculture. We have an agricultural loan policy to assist in underwriting agricultural loans. Agricultural loans are made to a diversified customer base that include dairy, swine and poultry farmers and their support businesses. Agricultural loans focus on character, cash flow and collateral, while also taking into account the particular risks of the industry. Loan terms are generally 20 years or less, with one to five year adjustable interest rates. The adjustable rates are typically tied to a margin above the comparable Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh borrowing rate with a typical loan to value of less than 80%. We evaluate the financial strength of the integrators we have exposure to with our poultry and swine agricultural customers. The Bank is a preferred lender under the USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and participates in the FSA guaranteed loan program.
The Bank, as part of its commitment to the communities it serves, is an active lender for projects by our local municipalities and school districts. These loans range from short term bridge financing to 20 year term loans for specific projects. These loans are typically written at rates that adjust at least every five years. Due to the size of certain municipal loans, we have developed participation lending relationships with other community banks that allow us to meet regulatory compliance issues, while meeting the needs of the customer. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate balance of our participation loans, in which a portion was sold to other lender’s totaled $126.5 million, of which $76.2 million was sold.
Index
Activity associated with exploration for natural gas in 2020 was similar to 2019. Certain entities drilled new wells and created new pad sites and pipelines, while other companies only maintained their existing wells. Natural gas prices remained low in 2020. While the Bank has loaned to companies that service the exploration activities, the Bank did not originate any loans to companies performing the actual drilling and exploration activities. Loans made by the Company were to service industry customers which included trucking companies, stone quarries and other support businesses. We also originated loans to businesses and individuals for restaurants, hotels and apartment rentals that were developed and expanded to meet the housing and living needs of the gas workers. Due to our understanding of the industry and its cyclical nature, the loans made for natural gas-related activities were originated in a prudent and cautious manner and were subject to specific policies and procedures for lending to these entities, which included lower loan to value thresholds, shortened amortization periods, and expansion of our monitoring of loan concentrations associated with this activity.
The following table shows the year-end composition of the loan portfolio for the five years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):
Total loans grew $289.7 million in 2020 and total $1.41 billion at the end of 2020. The primary driver of growth during 2020 was the MidCoast acquisition, which increased loans $223.2 million and the PPP program administered by the SBA, which generated loan growth of $37.2 million for 2020. We also established a new relationship that allows us to fund student loans, which drove the increase in consumer lending. We had numerous municipal relationships refinance through the bond markets due to the low interest rate environment.
Index
Residential real estate loans decreased $15.2 million. As a result of the loan interest rate environment, there was significant refinancing of residential loans, some of which met the requirements of the secondary market and were subsequently sold. During 2020, $88.0 million of residential real estate loans were originated for sale on the secondary market, which compares to $21.2 million for 2019. For loans sold on the secondary market, the Company recognizes fee income for servicing these sold loans, which is included in non-interest income.
The following table shows the maturity of commercial business and agricultural, state and political subdivision loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction loans as of December 31, 2020, classified according to the sensitivity to changes in interest rates within various time intervals (in thousands). The table does not include any estimate of prepayments which significantly shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below. Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less.
Total loans grew $33.7 million in 2019 and total $1.12 billion at the end of 2019. During 2019, the Company experienced growth in agricultural real estate loans of $26.9 million, commercial real estate loans of $22.8 million and other agricultural loans of $12.9 million. A portion of the growth in agricultural and commercial loan categories was due to transfers from construction loans as projects were completed in 2019. The remaining growth was primarily in our southcentral and central Pennsylvania markets.
Residential real estate loans increased $1.8 million. Demand for non-conforming loans was slightly higher than previous years but remains highly competitive, especially in the north central Pennsylvania market. During 2019, $21.2 million of residential real estate loans were originated for sale on the secondary market, which compares to $19.5 million for 2018.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality Risk
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable future loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses is charged against current income. Loans deemed not collectable are charged-off against the allowance while subsequent recoveries increase the allowance. The following table presents an analysis of the change in the allowance for loan losses and a summary of our non-performing assets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. All non-accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are also included the non-accruing loans totals.
Index
The Company believes it utilizes a disciplined and thorough loan review process based upon its internal loan policy approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The purpose of the review is to assess loan quality, analyze delinquencies, identify problem loans, evaluate potential charge-offs and recoveries, and assess general overall economic conditions in the markets served. An external independent loan review is performed on our commercial portfolio at least semi-annually for the Company. The external consultant is engaged to 1) review a minimum of 50% (55% for loans in 2016) of the dollar volume of the commercial loan portfolio on an annual basis, 2) new loans originated for over $1.0 million in the last year, 3) a majority of borrowers with commitments greater than or equal to $1.0 million, 4) selected loan relationships over $750,000 which are over 30 days past due, or classified Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss, and 5) such other loans which management or the consultant deems appropriate. As part of this review, our underwriting process and loan grading system is evaluated.
Index
Management believes it uses the best information available to make such determinations and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of December 31, 2020. However, future adjustments could be required if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions and estimates used in making the initial determination. A prolonged downturn in the economy, changes in the economies of various segments of our agricultural and commercial portfolios, high unemployment rates, significant changes in the value of collateral and delays in receiving financial information from borrowers could result in increased levels of non-performing assets, charge-offs, loan loss provisions and reduction in income. Additionally, bank regulatory agencies periodically examine the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. The banking agencies could require the recognition of additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.
On a monthly basis, problem loans are identified and updated primarily using internally prepared past due reports. Based on data surrounding the collection process of each identified loan, the loan may be added or deleted from the monthly watch list. The watch list includes loans graded special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss, as well as additional loans that management may choose to include. Watch list loans are continually monitored going forward until satisfactory conditions exist that allow management to upgrade and remove the loan from the watchlist. In certain cases, loans may be placed on non-accrual status or charged-off based upon management’s evaluation of the borrower’s ability to pay. All commercial loans, which include commercial real estate, agricultural real estate, state and political subdivision loans, other commercial loans and other agricultural loans, on non-accrual are evaluated quarterly for impairment.
The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to a formal, quarterly analysis by management of the Company. In order to better analyze the risks associated with the loan portfolio, the entire portfolio is divided into several categories. As stated above, loans on non-accrual status are specifically reviewed for impairment and given a specific reserve, if appropriate. Loans evaluated and not found to be impaired are included with other performing loans, by category, by their respective homogenous pools. Three year average historical loss factors were calculated for each pool and applied to the performing portion of the loan category for each year presented. The historical loss factors for both reviewed and homogeneous pools are adjusted based upon the following qualitative factors:
• Level of and trends in delinquencies, impaired/classified loans
▪ Change in volume and severity of past due loans
▪ Volume of non-accrual loans
▪ Volume and severity of classified, adversely or graded loans
• Level of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries
• Trends in volume, terms and nature of the loan portfolio
• Effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and any other changes in lending and recovery policies, procedures and practices
• Changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system
• Experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff
• National, state, regional and local economic trends and business conditions
▪ General economic conditions
▪ Unemployment rates
▪ Inflation / CPI
▪ Changes in values of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans
• Industry conditions including the effects of external factors such as competition, legal, and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses.
• Existence and effect of any credit concentrations, and changes in the level of such concentrations
• Any change in the level of board oversight

Index
The allowance for loan losses was $15,815,000 or 1.13% of total loans as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $13,845,000 or 1.24% of loans as of December 31, 2019. The decrease as a percent of loans is due to loans acquired as part of the MidCoast acquisition being excluded from the allowance calculation, unless the loan experiences a downgrade since acquisition. The $1,970,000 increase is a result of a $2,400,000 provision for loan losses less net charge-offs of $430,000. During 2020, two customers accounted for the majority of the charge-offs, $425,000 in total, and if they were excluded the net charge-off amount would be lower than prior years. The following table shows the distribution of the allowance for loan losses and the percentage of loans compared to total loans by loan category (dollars in thousands) as of December 31:
As a result of previous loss experiences and other risk factors utilized in determining the allowance, the Bank’s allocation of the allowance does not directly correspond to the actual balances of the loan portfolio. While commercial and agricultural real estate loans total 64.8% of the loan portfolio, 70.6% of the allowance is assigned to these portions of the loan portfolio as these loans have more inherent risks than residential real estate or loans to state and political subdivisions. Residential real estate loans comprise 14.4% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 7.4% of the allowance is assigned to this segment as generally there are less inherent risks then commercial and agricultural loans.
The following table identifies amounts of loans contractually past due 30 to 90 days and non-performing loans by loan category, as well as the change from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in non-performing loans (in thousands). Non-performing loans include those accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more and non-accrual loans. Interest does not accrue on non-accrual loans. Subsequent cash payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending upon management’s assessment of its ultimate ability to collect principal and interest.
Index
The Company is working with customers directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has offered assistance in accordance with regulator guidelines. As a result of the current economic slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is engaging in more frequent communication with borrowers to better understand their situation and the challenges faced, allowing it to respond proactively as needs and issues arise. Should economic conditions worsen, the Company could experience increases in non-performing loans and further increases in its required allowance for loan losses and record additional provision expense. It is possible that the Company’s asset quality measures could worsen at future measurement periods if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are prolonged.
The following table shows the distribution of non-performing loans by loan category (in thousands) for the past five years as of December 31:
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2,400,000 which compares to $1,675,000 for the same period in 2020, an increase of $725,000. The increase is primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the national and local economies, as well as an increase in organic loans, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2020. Non-performing loans decreased $766,000 from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 with the decrease being primarily due to one customer relationship that paid off a portion of their balance after selling some collateral. At December 31, 2020, approximately 53.0% of the Bank’s non-performing loans are associated with the following three customer relationships:
• A commercial loan relationship with $2.2 million outstanding, and additional letters of credit of $2.1 million available, secured by undeveloped land, stone quarries and equipment, was on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020. The slowdown in the exploration for natural gas has significantly impacted the cash flows of the customer, who provides excavation services and stone for pad construction related to these activities. During 2019, the Company had the underlying equipment collateral appraised. The 2019 appraisal indicated a decrease in collateral values compared to the appraisal ordered for the loan origination and an appraisal performed in 2017, however, the loan is still considered well secured on a loan to value basis. In the fourth quarter of 2020, a forbearance agreement was signed with this customer. Management determined that no specific reserve was required as of December 31, 2020.
Index
• An agricultural loan customer with a total loan relationship of $2.6 million, secured by real estate, equipment and cattle, was on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020. The customer declared bankruptcy during the fourth quarter of 2018 and developed a workout plan that was approved in the fourth quarter of 2019 and resulted in monthly payments resuming in late 2019. Included within these loans to this customer are $953,000 of loans which are subject to Farm Service Agency guarantees. Depressed milk prices and the pandemic have created cash flow difficulties for this customer. Absent a sizable and sustained increase in milk prices, which is not assured, we will need to rely upon the collateral for repayment of interest and principal. As of December 31, 2020, there was a specific reserve of $214,000 for this relationship.
• An agricultural loan customer with a total loan relationship of $1.2 million, secured by real estate was on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the cash flow difficulties this customer was experiencing. We expect that we will need to rely upon the collateral for repayment of interest and principal. Management reviewed the collateral and determined that no specific reserve was required as of December 31, 2020.
Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was adequate at that date, which was based on the following factors:
• Three loan relationships comprise 53.0% of the non-performing loan balance, which has approximately $214,000 of specific reserves as of December 31, 2020.
• The Company has a history of low charge-offs, and were 0.03% in 2020, which was primarily due to two relationships, which compares to 0.06% of average loans for 2019.
Bank Owned Life Insurance
The Company holds bank owned life insurance policies to offset current and future employee benefit costs. These policies provide the Bank with an asset that generates earnings to partially offset the current costs of benefits, and eventually (at the death of the insureds) provide partial recovery of cash outflows associated with the benefits. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cash surrender value of the life insurance was $32.6 million and $28.1 million, respectively. The primary cause of the increase was related to the acquisition of MidCoast, which increased the balance by $3.8 million. The change in cash surrender value, net of purchases and amounts acquired through acquisitions, is recognized in the results of operations. The amounts recorded as non-interest income totaled $695,000, $623,000 and $622,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company evaluates annually the risks associated with the life insurance policies, including limits on the amount of coverage and an evaluation of the various carriers’ credit ratings.
Effective January 1, 2015, the Company restructured its agreements so that any death benefits received from a policy while the insured person is an active employee of the Bank will be split with the beneficiary of the policy. Under the restructured agreements, the employee’s beneficiary will be entitled to receive 50% of the net amount at risk from the proceeds. The policies acquired as part of the acquisition of MidCoast are only for the benefit of the Bank. The net amount at risk is the total death benefit payable less the cash surrender value of the policy as of the date of death. The policies acquired as part of the acquisition of FNB, provide a fixed dollar benefit for the beneficiarys’ estate, which is dependent on several factors including whether the covered individual was a Director of FNB or an employee of FNB and their salary level. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance sheet is a liability of $687,000 and $684,000, respectively, for the obligation under the split-dollar benefit agreements.
Other Assets
Other assets increased $3.0 million in 2020 to $19.4 million from $16.4 million in 2019. The deferred tax asset increased $2.2 million, primarily due to the MidCoast acquisition. We entered into one new lease during 2020 and acquired three leases as part of the acquisition, which resulted in the right of use asset for facilities increasing $1.1 million. As a result of derivative transactions for the Company and customers, other assets increased $1.1 million. Foreclosed properties were sold during 2020, which resulted in a decrease to other assets of $1.6 million.
Index
Other assets increased $2.7 million in 2019 to $16.4 million from $13.6 million in 2018. As a result of settling a lawsuit with a bankrupt customer, OREO increased $2.8 million. The deferred tax asset decreased $1.2 million as a result of an increase in unrealized gains on available for sale investments. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company recorded a right of use asset for facilities leased that was $1.2 million as of December 31, 2019. As a result of an increase in FHLB borrowings and letters of credit, regulatory stock increased $739,000.
Deposits
The following table shows the breakdown of deposits by deposit type (dollars in thousands) at December 31:
Total deposits increased $377.7 million in 2020, or 31.2%. The primary driver of the growth was the MidCoast acquisition, in which $208.8 million of deposits were acquired. The remaining growth was driven by customers holding more cash as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was experienced across all markets, which was facilitated by various government stimulus plans. As a percentage of total deposits, non-interest bearing deposits totaled 19.1% as of the end of 2020, which compares to 16.9% at the end of 2019. We continue to enhance our cash management services to improve our customer services and to grow deposits through our current deposit and loan customers. As a result of market conditions in the first half of 2020, we issued long term brokered CD’s and had a balance of $23.8 million of brokered CD’s outstanding as of December 31, 2020 compared to $15.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The rates paid on certificates of deposit by the Company remain competitive with rates paid by our competition.
Total deposits increased $26.0 million in 2019, or 2.2%. The growth in non-interest bearing deposits was driven by new customers in our south central and central Pennsylvania markets. As a percentage of total deposits, non-interest bearing deposits totaled 16.9% as of the end of 2019, which compares to 15.2% at the end of 2018. The increase in savings deposits is attributable to growth in the central and south central markets and the acquisition of new customers in these markets. As a result of market conditions, we had $15.0 million of brokered CD’s outstanding as of December 31, 2019 compared to $20.0 million as of December 31, 2018, which accounts for a portion of the decrease in CDs. In addition, we had a municipal customer utilizes maturing CDs to fund an infrastructure project in their community, which resulted in $9.0 million decrease in CD’s.
Index
Remaining maturities of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more are as follows (dollars in thousands) at December 31:
Interest expense on certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more amounted to $2,575,000, $2,728,000 and $2,052,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Deposits by type of depositor are as follows (dollars in thousands) at December 31:
Borrowed Funds
Borrowed funds increased $3.7 million during 2020 as a result of an increase in repurchase agreements of $3.5 million. Short term borrowings from the FHLB decreased $19.8 million from December 31, 2019 and total $25.0 million at December 31, 2020, while long term borrowings from the FHLB increased $20.0 million and total $41.5 million. Term loans totaled $41.5 million and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in term loans was due to borrowing $20.0 million on a long-term basis (see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). As part of the MidCoast acquisition, we acquired $15.5 million of borrowed funds, which either matured or were called in 2020. Short term borrowings from the FHLB were $25.0 million as of December 21, 2020 compared to $44.5 million as of December 31, 2019. Management continually monitors interest rates in order to minimize interest rate risk in future years and as part of this may extend some of the short term borrowings via term notes. The Bank entered into two interest rate swap agreements to convert floating-rate debt to fixed rate debt on notional amounts of $15.0 million and $10.0 million on April 1, 2020 and expire on April 1, 2025 and April 1, 2027. On April 13, 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert floating-rate debt to fixed rate debt on a notional amount of $7.5 million. The interest rate swap agreement expires on June 17, 2027. On May 14, 2020, the Bank entered into three two year forward interest rate swaps that will convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt on notional amounts of $6.0 million each. The interest rate swap agreements expire on May 14, 2027, 2029 and 2032. The interest rate swap instruments involves an agreement to receive a floating rate and pay a fixed rate, at specified intervals, calculated on the agreed-upon notional amounts. The differentials paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in the period. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2020 was $11,000 and is included within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Borrowed funds decreased $6.1 million during 2019 as a result of our deposit growth and net income exceeding the loan growth experienced in 2019. The decrease was associated with a decrease of $7.4 million of short term borrowings from the FHLB. We experienced a $6.7 million decrease in repurchase agreements. Term loans totaled $21.5 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in term loans was due to borrowing $10.0 million on a long-term basis and a $2.0 million maturity in 2019 (see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). Short term borrowings from the FHLB were $44.5 million as of December 21, 2019 compared to $52.2 million as of December 31, 2018.
Index
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities increased $4.5 million to $18.7 million during 2020. We entered into one new lease during 2020 and acquired three leases as part of the Midcoast acquisition, which resulted in the right of use asset for facilities increasing $1.1 million. As a result of derivate transactions for the Company and customers, other liabilities increased $1.0 million. As a result of the discount rates utilized for the pension plan, a pension liability was recorded of $773,000. Employee benefit accruals, including profit sharing increased $1.4 million.
Other liabilities increased slightly to $14.2 million during 2019. The primary driver of the increase was the recording of a right of use liability for the Company’s operating leases during 2019 that totaled $1.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and an increase in employee benefit accruals of $863,000. These increases were offset by a decrease associated with an available for sale security purchase of $1.5 million that did not settle by December 31, 2018 that subsequently settled in 2019.
Stockholders’ Equity
We evaluate stockholders’ equity in relation to total assets and the risk associated with those assets. The greater our capital resources, the greater the likelihood of meeting our cash obligations and absorbing unforeseen losses. For these reasons, capital adequacy has been, and will continue to be, of paramount importance. Due to its importance, we develop a capital plan and stress test capital levels using various techniques and assumptions annually to ensure that in the event of unforeseen circumstances, we would remain in compliance with our capital plan approved by the Board of Directors and regulatory requirement levels.
Our Board of Directors determines our cash dividend rate after considering our capital requirements, current and projected net income, and other factors. In 2020 and 2019, the Company paid out 29.32% and 32.40% of net income in cash dividends, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, the total number of common shares outstanding was 3,921,850. For comparative purposes, outstanding shares for prior periods were adjusted for the June 2020 stock dividend in computing earnings and cash dividends per share as detailed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As part of the MidCoast acquisition, we issued 373,356 shares with a value of $19.2 million based on the Company’s closing stock price of $51.50 per share on April 17, 2020. During 2020, we purchased 40,438 shares of treasury stock at a weighted average cost of $52.48 per share. The Company awarded 5,160 shares of restricted stock to employees at a weighted average cost per share of $50.89 under an equity incentive plan. The Board of Directors was awarded 1,800 shares at a cost of $51.14 per share under an incentive plan.
Stockholders’ equity increased 25.5% in 2020 to $194.3 million. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity increased $36.3 million, or 23.3%. As part of the MidCoast acquisition, we issued 373,356 shares with a value of $19.2 million based on the Company’s closing stock price of $51.50 per share on April 17, 2020. In addition, net income was $25,103,000, offset by net cash dividends of $7,360,000 and net treasury stock activity of $788,000. All of the Company’s debt investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, making this portion of the Company’s balance sheet more sensitive to the changing market value of investments. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased $3,216,000 from December 31, 2019, primarily as result of the increase in the fair market value of the investment portfolio. Total stockholders’ equity was approximately 10.27% of total assets as of December 31, 2020, compared to 10.56% of total assets as of December 31, 2019.
Index
Stockholders’ equity increased 11.2% in 2019 to $154.8 million. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity increased $12.3 million, or 8.6%. This increase is due to net income of $19,490,000, offset by net cash dividends of $6,315,000 and net treasury stock activity of $845,000. All of the Company’s debt investment securities are classified as available-for-sale. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased $3,292,000 from December 31, 2018, primarily as result of the increase in the fair market value of the investment portfolio. Total stockholders’ equity was approximately 10.56% of total assets as of December 31, 2019, compared to 9.73% of total assets as of December 31, 2018.
LIQUIDITY
Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors. Liquidity is needed to meet depositors’ withdrawal demands, extend credit to meet borrowers’ needs, provide funds for normal operating expenses and cash dividends, and fund future capital expenditures.
To maintain proper liquidity, we use funds management policies along with our investment and asset liability policies to assure we can meet our financial obligations to depositors, credit customers and stockholders. Management monitors liquidity by reviewing loan demand, investment opportunities, deposit pricing and the cost and availability of borrowing funds. Additionally, the bank has established various limits and ratios to monitor liquidity. On a quarterly basis, we stress test our liquidity position to ensure that the Bank has the capability of meeting its cash flow requirements in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The Company’s historical activity in this area can be seen in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows from investing and financing activities.
Cash generated by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities influences liquidity management. The most important source of funds is the deposits that are primarily core deposits (deposits from customers with other relationships). Short-term debt from the Federal Home Loan Bank supplements the Company’s availability of funds as well as a line of credit arrangement with a corresponding bank. Other sources of short-term funds include brokered CDs and the sale of loans, if needed.
The Company’s use of funds is shown in the investing activity section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, where the net loan activity is detailed. Other significant uses of funds are capital expenditures, purchase of loans and acquisition premiums. Surplus funds are then invested in investment securities.
Capital expenditures, including software purchases in 2020 totaled $942,000, which included:
▪ Teller and imaging software totaling $709,000
▪ Leasehold improvements and certain equipment for an office opened in 2020 totaling $73,000
▪ Building and ground improvements totaling $73,000
▪ Computer, network and copier upgrades totaling $76,000
Capital expenditures in 2019 totaled $483,000, which included:
▪ Leasehold improvements and certain equipment for an office opened in 2019 totaling $28,000
▪ Building and ground improvements totaling $90,000
▪ Company vehicle purchased totaling $42,000
▪ Generator totaling $23,000
▪ Computer, network and copier upgrades totaling $300,000
We expect these expenditures will support our initiatives and will create operating efficiencies, while providing quality customer service.
Index
In addition to the Bank’s cash balances, the Bank achieves additional liquidity primarily from its investment in the FHLB of Pittsburgh and the resulting borrowing capacity obtained through this investment, investments that mature in less than one year and expected principal repayments from mortgage backed securities. The Bank has a maximum borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of approximately $690.5 million, inclusive of any outstanding amounts, as a source of liquidity. The Bank also has two federal funds line with third party providers in the total amount of $34.0 million as of December 31, 2020, which is unsecured and a borrower in custody agreement was established with the FRB in the amount of $4.4 million, which is collateralized by $12.9 million of municipal loans.
The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders. The Company also has repurchased shares of its common stock. The Company’s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank may not declare a dividend without approval of the FRB, unless the dividend to be declared by the Bank’s Board of Directors does not exceed the total of: (i) the Bank’s net profits for the current year to date, plus (ii) its retained net profits for the preceding two current years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, the Bank can only pay dividends to the extent that its retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed its bad debts. The FRB, the OCC, the PDB and the FDIC have formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings, with some exceptions. The Prompt Corrective Action Rules, described above, further limit the ability of banks to pay dividends, because banks which are not classified as well capitalized or adequately capitalized may not pay dividends and no dividend may be paid which would make the Bank undercapitalized after the dividend. At December 31, 2020, the Company (unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $7.2 million.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The Company has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations which may require cash payments. The following table (in thousands) presents as of December 31, 2020, significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date. Further discussion of the obligations can be found in Notes 9, 10 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, unused lines of credit and letters of credit. For information about our loan commitments, unused lines of credit and letters of credit, see Note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Index
INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
The objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances and the market value risk of assets and liabilities.
Because of the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk and, since the Company has no trading portfolio, it is not subject to trading risk.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had equity securities that represent only 0.6% of our investment portfolio, and therefore market risk related to equity securities is not significant.
The primary factors that make assets interest-sensitive include adjustable-rate features on loans and investments, loan repayments, investment maturities and money market investments. The primary components of interest-sensitive liabilities include maturing certificates of deposit, IRA certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings. Savings deposits, NOW accounts and money market investor accounts, with the exception of top interest tier money market and NOW accounts, are considered core deposits and are not short-term interest sensitive and therefore are included in the table below in the over five year column. Top interest tier money market and NOW accounts are included in the table below in the within three month column. Borrowings subject to swap arrangements are included in the table below based on the swap arrangement maturity.
The following table shows the cumulative static gap (at amortized cost) for various time intervals (dollars in thousands):
Index
The previous table and the simulation models discussed below are presented assuming money market investment accounts and NOW accounts in the top interest rate tier are re-priced within the first three months. The loan amounts reflect the principal balances expected to be re-priced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated early payoffs.
Gap analysis, one of the methods used by us to analyze interest rate risk, does not necessarily show the precise impact of specific interest rate movements on the Bank’s net interest income because the re-pricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competition and other pressures. In addition, assets and liabilities within the same period may, in fact, be repaid at different times and at different rate levels. We have not experienced the kind of earnings volatility that might be indicated from gap analysis.
The Bank currently uses a computer simulation model to better measure the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income. We use the model as part of our risk management and asset liability management processes that we believe will effectively identify, measure, and monitor the Bank’s risk exposure. In this analysis, the Bank examines the results of movements in interest rates with additional assumptions made concerning the timing of interest rate changes, prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage securities and deposit pricing movements. Shock scenarios, which assume a parallel shift in interest rates and is instantaneous, typically have the greatest impact on net interest income. The following is a rate shock analysis and the impact on net interest income as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
The model makes estimates, at each level of interest rate change, regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities, call activity of other investment securities, and deposit selection, re-pricing and maturity structure. Because of these assumptions, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change on net interest income. Additionally, the changes above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change. The projections above utilize a static balance sheet and do not include any changes that may result from the growth of the Bank. Management has developed policy limits for acceptable changes in net interest income for multiple scenarios, including shock scenarios. As of December 31, 2020, changes in net interest income projected for all scenarios, including the shock scenarios noted above are in line with Bank policy limits for interest rate risk.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company’s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. The accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. Our most complex accounting policies require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.
Index
Other than Temporary Impairment
All securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary and is a matter of judgment. For debt securities, management considers whether the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference defined as the credit loss), the magnitude and duration of the decline, the reasons underlying the decline and the Company’s intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery in market value, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary. Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, if the Company does not intend to sell the security, and it is more-likely-than-not that it will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of credit loss. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost (the difference defined as the non-credit portion) is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Otherwise, the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is charged to earnings.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Arriving at an adequate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment. The Company’s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.
Management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment; as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors, which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates that may be susceptible to significant change, subjecting the Bank to volatility of earnings. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged-off and reduced by loans charged-off. For a full discussion of the Company’s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an evaluation of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Based on the fair value of the reporting unit, no impairment of goodwill was recognized in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
Pension Benefits
Pension costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, benefits earned, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation of future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Company’s pension obligations and future expense. Our pension benefits are described further in Note 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
Deferred Tax Assets
We use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized. If future income should prove non-existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied, the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced. Management also evaluates deferred tax assets to determine if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be utilized in future periods. If not, a valuation allowance is recorded. Our deferred tax assets are described further in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.
Index
Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. As of acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. The calculation of intangible assets including core deposits and the fair value of loans are based on significant judgements. Core deposits intangibles are calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on various factors including discount rate, attrition rate, interest rate, cost of alternative funds and net maintenance costs.
Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value with no carryover of related allowance for credit losses. Any allowance for loan loss on these pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (meaning the present value of all cash flows expected at acquisition that ultimately are not to be received). Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. Management considers a number of factors in evaluating the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life of the acquired loans, delinquency status, estimated prepayments, payment options and other loan features, internal risk grade, estimated value of the underlying collateral and interest rate environment.
