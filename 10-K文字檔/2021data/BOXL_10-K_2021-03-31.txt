Overview
We are an educational technology company that is seeking to become a world leading innovator and integrator of interactive products and software for schools, as well as for business and government learning spaces. We currently design, produce and distribute interactive projectors and distribute interactive technologies, including flat panels, projectors, whiteboards and peripherals to the education market. We also distribute science, technology, engineering and math (or “STEM”) products, including a portable science lab. All of our products are integrated into our classroom software suite that provides tools for whole class learning, assessment and collaboration.
To date, we have generated substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our software and interactive displays to the K-12 U.S. educational market.
We have also implemented a comprehensive plan to reach profitability both from our core business operations and as a result of making strategic business acquisitions. We have already started to implement this strategy as set forth below. Highlights of our plan include:
● Integrating products of the acquired companies and cross training our sales reps to increase their offerings. The combination of products and cross training has already resulted in increased sales. The synergy we have found between the products of Boxlight and Mimio are adding opportunities to resellers for both companies to increase their sales.
● Hiring new sales representatives with significant education technology sales experience in their respective territories and our current pipeline has reached a record high level.
● Seeking to increase demand in the US market for technology sales and have the products and infrastructure in place to handle our expected growth.
Recent Acquisitions
Effective September 24, 2020, the Company acquired Sahara Presentation Systems PLC, a leader in distributed and manufactured AV solutions. Headquartered in the United Kingdom, Sahara is a leader in distributed AV products and a manufacturer of multi-award-winning touchscreens and digital signage products, including the globally renowned Clevertouch and Sedao brands. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to the shareholders of Sahara a total purchase price of GBP 74.0 million (approximately USD $94.9 million) in the form of GBP 52.0 million (approximately USD $66.7 million) in cash and GBP 22.0 million (approximately USD $28.2 million) in our Series B convertible preferred stock and our Series C convertible preferred stock.
On March 24, 2021 we entered into a share redemption and conversion agreement with the former Sahara shareholders who own approximately 96% of our Series B and Series C preferred stock. Under the agreement, we agreed to redeem and purchase from such preferred stockholders on or before June 30, 2021 all of the shares of Series B preferred stock for £11.5 million being the stated or liquidation value of the Series B preferred stock plus (b) accrued dividends from January 1, 2021 to the date of purchase. In addition, the holders of 96% of the Series C preferred stock agreed to convert those shares into 7.6 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.66 per share. In the event for any reason, we do not complete the conversion and redemption by June 30, 2021, and the Sahara shareholders do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate without liability by any party.
Effective April 17, 2020, the Company acquired the assets, and assumed certain liabilities of MyStemKits and STEM Education Holdings, Pty, an Australian corporation (“STEM”), the largest online collection of K-12 STEM curriculum for 3D printing.
Effective March 12, 2019, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Modern Robotics Inc. (MRI), based in Miami, Florida. MRI is engaged in the business of developing, selling and distributing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), robotics and programming solutions to the global education market.
On August 31, 2018, we purchased 100% of the membership interest equity of EOS, an Arizona limited liability company owned by Daniel and Aleksandra Leis. EOS is in the business of providing technology consulting, training, and professional development services to create sustainable programs that integrate technology with curriculum in K-12 schools and districts.
Effective June 22, 2018, and pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, the Company Parent acquired 100% of the capital stock of the Qwizdom Companies. The Qwizdom Companies develop software and hardware solutions that are quick to implement and designed to increase participation, provide immediate data feedback, and, most importantly, accelerate and improve comprehension and learning. The Qwizdom Companies have offices outside Seattle, WA and Belfast, Northern Ireland and deliver products in 44 languages to customers around the world through a network of partners. Over the last three years, over 80,000 licenses have been distributed for the Qwizdom Companies’ interactive whiteboard software and online solutions.
Effective May 9, 2018, and pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the capital stock of Cohuba based in Lancashire, England. Cohuba produces, sells and distributes interactive display panels designed to provide new learning and working experiences through high-quality technologies and solutions through in-room and room-to-room multi-devices multi-user collaboration.
Our Acquisition Strategy and Challenges
Our growth strategy includes acquiring assets and technologies of companies that have products, technologies, industry specializations or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expect to expend significant resources to undertake business, financial and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition targets, and there is no guarantee that we will complete any acquisition that we pursue.
We believe we can achieve significant cost-savings by merging the operations of the companies we acquire and after their acquisition leverage the opportunity to reduce costs through the following methods:
● Staff reductions - consolidating resources, such as accounting, marketing and human resources.
● Economies of scale - improved purchasing power with a greater ability to negotiate prices with suppliers.
● Improved market reach and industry visibility - increase in customer base and entry into new markets.
As a result, we believe that an analysis of the historical costs and expenses of our Target Sellers (a company that is the subject of an attempted acquisition) prior to their acquisition will not provide guidance as to the anticipated results after acquisition. We anticipate that we will be able to achieve significant reductions in our costs of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses from the levels currently incurred by the Target Sellers operating independently, thereby increasing our EBITDA and cash flows.
Components of our Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Revenue
Our revenue is comprised of product revenue, software revenue, installation revenue and professional development revenue.
● Product and Software revenues. Product and software revenues are derived from the sale of our interactive projectors, flat panels, peripherals and accessories, along with other third-party products, directly to our customers, as well as through our network of domestic and international distributors.
● Installation revenue. We receive revenue from installation services that we outsource to third parties.
● Professional development revenue. We receive revenue from providing professional development services through third parties and our network of distributors.
Cost of revenue
Our cost of revenue is comprised of the following:
● third-party logistics costs;
● costs to purchase components and finished goods directly;
● inbound and outbound freight costs and duties;
● costs associated with the repair of products under warranty;
● write-downs of inventory carrying value to adjust for excess and obsolete inventory and periodic physical inventory counts;
● cost of professionals to deliver the professional development training; and
● customs expense.
We outsource some of our warehouse operations and order fulfillment and we purchase products from related entities and third parties. Our product costs vary directly with volume and based on the costs of underlying product components as well as the prices we negotiate with our contract manufacturers. Shipping costs fluctuate with volume as well as with the method of shipping chosen in order to meet customer demand. As a global company with suppliers centered in Asia and customers located worldwide, we have used, and may in the future use, air shipping to deliver our products directly to our customers. Air shipping is more costly than sea or ground shipping or other delivery options. We primarily use air shipping to meet the demand of our products during peak seasons and new product launches. The Company did not experience material delays in shipping during 2020 that materially negatively impacted our revenues.
Gross profit and gross profit margin
Our gross profit and gross profit margin have been, and may in the future be, influenced by several factors including: product, channel and geographical revenue mix; changes in product costs related to the release of projector models; component, contract manufacturing and supplier pricing and foreign currency exchange. As we primarily procure our product components and manufacture our products in Asia, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor costs, in other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our future average selling prices and unit costs. Gross profit and gross profit margin may fluctuate over time based on the factors described above.
Operating expenses
We classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development and general and administrative.
Research and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related costs, prototype and sample costs, design costs and global product certifications mostly for wireless certifications.
General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs, which include salaries, as well as the costs of professional services, such as accounting and legal, facilities, information technology, depreciation and amortization and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue, notably in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year when we have historically experienced our highest levels of revenue.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, gains (losses) on the settlements of debt and trade payable obligations exchanged for common shares, and the effects of changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities.
Income tax expense
We are subject to income taxes in the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Sweden, Finland, Holland, and Germany where we do business. The United Kingdom, Mexico, Sweden, Finland, Holland, and Germany have a statutory tax rate different from that in the United States. Additionally, certain of our international earnings are also taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the absorption of foreign tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our current expectations, charges or credits to our income tax expense may become necessary. Any such adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
Operating Results - Boxlight Corporation
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Revenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.9 million as compared to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a 66% increase. Revenues consist of product revenue, software revenue, product installation and professional development. The increase in revenues was primarily a result of the acquisition of Sahara Presentation Systems in September 2020 and increased demand for our solutions in both the U.S. and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (together “EMEA”).
Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $45.0 million as compared to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an 87% increase. Cost of revenues consists primarily of product cost, freight expenses, customs expense and inventory adjustments. The decrease in cost of revenues decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cost of goods related to hardware sales of $5 million directly related to the decrease in sales volume. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in customs expense.
Gross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9.9 million as compared to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Gross Profit Margin decreased from 27% in 2019 to 18% in 2020. The gross margin decrease was driven by the effects of certain Sahara purchase accounting adjustments of $5.1 million. The resulting normalized gross profit rate for the for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 27%.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.0 million and 39% of revenue as compared to $15.8 million and 48% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from additional personnel costs associated with the acquired Sahara operations. As noted in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table below, there were $0.4 million and $0.1 million of acquisition and restructuring expenses that are backed out of general and administration expenses because of their non-recurring nature.
Research and Development Expense. Research and development expense was $1.4 million and 3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.2 million and 4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development expense primarily consists of costs associated with development of proprietary technology. The increase in research and development expense was primarily driven by an increase in contract services related to software development.
Other income (expense), net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(4.3) million as compared to $(1.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other expense increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $1.0 million associated with increased borrowings, and $3.1 million of losses incurred on the settlement of certain debt obligations in exchange for issuance of common shares.
Net loss. Net losses were $16.2 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the net loss was primarily due to lower sales volume, increased salaries and bonus expense, and increased interest expense.
To provide investors with additional insight and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and decision-making surrounding operations, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP financial measures of earnings.
EBITDA represents net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, plus stock compensation expense and non-recurring expenses and minus changes in fair value of derivative liabilities. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business model. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess the strength of the underlying operations of our business. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measure that is derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. We find this especially useful when reviewing results of operations, which include large non-cash amortizations of intangibles assets from acquisitions. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following table contains reconciliations of net losses to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.

December 31, 2020 and 2019 to EBITDA
Discussion of Effect of Seasonality on Financial Condition
Certain accounts on our balance sheets are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As our business and revenues grow, we expect these seasonal trends to be reduced. The bulk of our products are shipped to our educational customers prior to the beginning of the school year, usually in July, August or September. To prepare for the upcoming school year, we generally build up inventories during the second quarter of the year. Therefore, inventories tend to be at the highest levels at that point in time. In the first quarter of the year, inventories tend to decline significantly as products are delivered to customers and we do not need the same inventory levels during the first quarter. Accounts receivable balances tend to be at the highest levels in the third quarter, in which we record the highest level of sales.
Due to travel restrictions and concerns for the safety for our employees during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily eliminated all face-to-face meetings with customers and attendance at tradeshow events. In addition, we have limitations related to school access as a result of school closures. We are currently assessing the impact these changes will have on our peak season sales. Our initial assessment is that funding priority will be given to initiatives that provide for continuity of learning which may result in lower priority on total learning solution sales including hardware, software and teacher training.
We have been very proactive, and will continue to be proactive, in obtaining contracts during the fourth and first quarters that will help offset the seasonality of our business.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.5 million, a working capital position of $21.0 million, and a current ratio of 1.53. This financial position represents a significant improvement from a year ago at December 31, 2019 when we had a working capital deficit of $(7.3) million and $1.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net cash used in operating activities of $4.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively. We had net cash used in investing activities of $45.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, and net cash provided by investing activities of $6 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $65.6 million and $4.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In addition to the cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities we financed our operations during 2020 with a new $20.0 million tranche of debt funded by our primary lender, and from a pre-existing accounts receivable financing arrangement with another lender who purchases 85% of the eligible accounts receivable of the Company, up to $6.0 million, with the right of recourse. Our accounts receivable and our ability to borrow against accounts receivable provides an additional source of liquidity as cash payments are collected from customers in the normal course of business. Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year based on the seasonality of the business.
In the current COVID-19 pandemic environment, the availability of capital has been significantly reduced and the cost of capital has increased. Increasing our capital through equity issuance at this time could cause significant dilution to our existing stockholders as a result of diminished stock value due to market volatility and uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company is confident that it will be able to manage through the current challenges in the equity and debt finance markets by managing payment terms with customers and vendors.
Our cash requirements consist primarily of day-to-day operating expenses, capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to facility leases and other operating leases. We lease all of our office facilities. We expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations. We have limited credit available from our major vendors and are required to prepay for the majority of our inventory purchases, which further constrains our cash liquidity.
We believe that the combination of our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided by our operating activities, funds available from our accounts receivable financing facility, and access to the equity markets if and when needed, will be sufficient for the Company to meet its operating obligations and debt service requirements at least for the next year.
The Company had an accumulated deficit of $47.5 million as of December 31,2020 and net cash used in operations of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in in detail Note 1 to the enclosed consolidated financial statements, and briefly summarized below. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:
1. Revenue recognition
2. Business Acquisitions
3. Goodwill and Intangible assets
4. Share-based Compensation
REVENUE RECOGNITION
In accordance with the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. Product revenue is derived from the sale of projectors, interactive panels and related software and accessories to distributors, resellers, and end users. Service revenue is derived from hardware maintenance services, product installation, training, software maintenance, and subscription services.
The Company’s sales of interactive devices, including panels, projectors, and other interactive devices generally include hardware maintenance services, a license to software, and the provision of related software maintenance. In most cases, interactive devices are sold with hardware maintenance services with terms ranging from 36 - 60 months. Software maintenance includes technical support, product updates on a when and if available basis, and error correction services. At times, non-interactive projectors are also sold with hardware maintenance services with terms ranging from 36-60 months. The Company also licenses software independently of its interactive devices, in which case it is bundled with software maintenance, and in some cases, subscription services that include access to on-line content, access to replacement parts, and cloud-based applications. The Company’s software subscription services provide access to content and software applications on an as needed basis over the Internet, but do not provide the right to take delivery of the software applications.
The Company’s product sales, including those with software and related services, generally include a single payment up front for the products and services, and revenue is recorded net of estimated sales returns and rebates based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For most of the Company’s product sales, control transfers, and therefore, revenue is recognized when products are shipped at the point of origin. When the Company transfers control of its products to the customer prior to the related shipping and handling activities, the Company has adopted a policy of accounting for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than a performance obligation. For software product sales, control is transferred when the customer receives the related interactive hardware since the customer’s connection to the interactive hardware activates the software license at which time the software is made available to the customer. For the Company’s software maintenance, hardware maintenance, and subscription services, revenue is recognized ratably over time as the services are provided since time is the best output measure of how those services are transferred to the customer.
The Company’s installation, training and professional development services are generally sold separately from the Company’s products. Control of these services is transferred to our customers over time with hours/time incurred in providing the service being the best depiction of the transfer of services since the customer is receiving the benefit of the services as the work is performed.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, each of which represent promises within a contract that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”).
BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
The Company’s business acquisitions are accounted for as a business combination, in accordance with Topic 350 “Business Combinations”, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date on the consolidated balance sheet. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Income taxes, where applicable, are recognized and measured in accordance with Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgement and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, and discount rates.
GOODWILL and INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. Under ASC Topic 350 “Business Combinations”, we have an option to perform a “qualitative” assessment of the Company to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the business is less than carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. If we determine that the Company meets these criteria, we perform a qualitative assessment. In this qualitative assessment, we consider the following items: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. In addition, we assess whether the most recent fair value determination results in an amount that exceeds the carrying amount of the Company. Based on these assessments, we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount is not more likely than not.
Because the qualitative assessment is an option, we may bypass it for any reporting unit in any period as begin our analysis with the quantitative impairment test. We may elect to perform a quantitative impairment test based on the period of time that has passed since the most recent determination of fair value, even when the we do not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the business is less than carrying amount.
In analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test, we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if the fair value were to be less than carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its implied value.
Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. No material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. Intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company estimates the fair value of each stock compensation award at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Accordingly, stock compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the awards which is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Total expense related to the award is reduced by the fair value of the options that are forfeited by the employees that leave the Company prior to vesting.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to the pertinent guidance issued by the FASB. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets, liabilities, operating losses, and tax credit carry forwards using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized based on the levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences will be deductible.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Accordingly, certain specified reporting and other regulatory requirements for public companies are reduced for businesses that meet the qualifications for emerging growth companies.
These provisions include:
(1) an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
(2) an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
(3) an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
(4) reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
