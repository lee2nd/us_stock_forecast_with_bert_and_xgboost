ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A and with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere herein.
Overview
Applied Energetics, Inc., specializes in the development and manufacture of advanced high-performance lasers, high voltage electronics, advanced optical systems, and integrated guided energy systems for prospective defense, aerospace, industrial, and scientific customers worldwide.
Gregory J. Quarles was hired as the Chief Executive officer of AERG at the beginning of May 2019, and shortly thereafter, the company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with AOS on May 29, 2019. AOS is a Tucson-based corporation of which Stephen W. McCahon is the majority shareholder. Mr. McCahon was also retained under a Consulting Agreement with AERG and serves as our acting Chief Scientist. AERG has continued to expand its technical capabilities with the addition of numerous consultants and contractors, and agreements with several of the leading laser and optics universities in the country. The Asset Purchase Agreement and Consulting Agreement superseded certain 2017 Teaming and Consulting Agreements with AOS and McCahon.
AERG owns intellectual property that is integral and necessary for the development of Ultra-Short Pulse (“USP”) Lasers, Laser Guided Energy (“LGE”) and Direct Discharge Electrical products for military and commercial applications. AERG currently owns 26 patents and an additional 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (“GSPA”). These GSPA’s are held under secrecy orders of the US government and allow the company greatly extended protection rights, including having no expiration date until such time as they are no longer classified, after which, they will have the normal 20-year patent protection.
As of March 4, 2020, AERG executed a contract having a value of $165,919.77 with the US Army under its STTR program for a 90-day Phase 1 research program to investigate Standoff Electronic Denial systems using ultrashort pulse lasers. On October 20, 2020, it was announced that the company had received notice from the Army that it was not selected for Phase II. While we were disappointed, we continue to believe our advanced technologies can solve critical challenges faced by the U.S. military. Applied Energetics has multiple proposals outstanding for a variety of applications and our team continues to vigorously pursue new opportunities in an effort to leverage our significant intellectual property and core competencies in ultra-short pulse optical sources. The AERG team has recently submitted several provisional patent applications to expand and protect our USP portion of the patent portfolio. We anticipate that this intellectual property development will continue with other future submissions currently under development.
We submitted multiple proposals to various government agencies in 2020. Due to the closures of multiple agencies and work-from-home orders across various regions of the United States, we anticipate that reviews and funding decisions on these proposals might be delayed longer than anticipated as resources are focused on other matters within the government. AERG has received multiple notices from government agencies stating that “the vast number of proposals received, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the Government’s evaluation timelines”. In addition to these review-based delays, the US federal budget for 2021 was not approved by Congress by the October 1, 2020 start of the U.S. federal government fiscal year. The 2021 federal budget was signed into law on December 27, 2020 and the National Defense Authorization Act for 2021 was enacted after a congressional override of the President’s veto on January 1, 2021, a full three months after the official start of the 2021 fiscal year. This delay could also significantly impact review of proposals and awards of near-term contracts in 2021. The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act has language actually calling for funding and reports on strategies for “Development and fielding of high energy laser capabilities”, which could be addressed with AERG USP optical sources.
On April 28, 2020 AERG was awarded a loan for $132,760 through the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The terms of this loan were twenty-four months with a 1% annual interest rate. These funds were issued to cover payroll costs over 8 weeks of May and June 2020. Through the utilization of this PPP loan, AERG was able to keep all employees fully engaged during these two months of the pandemic. Our strategy is to follow the guidelines set forth by the SBA on the PPP program which will allow AERG to apply for a waiver of the loan because of this full employment retention and have the loan convert to a grant.
Path Forward
We believe that USP optical sources, LGE and LIPC are the cornerstone to AERG’s future and remain the key areas of our R&D focus for the near term. We plan to continue building our management team with highly qualified individuals, including possibly an additional director. We also intend to recruit additional personnel, including in the areas of R&D, marketing and finance. We have worked to align key innovations with our roadmap to encourage and enable internal filing for a broad, strategic and robust portfolio of IP and continue surveying the literature for acquisitions of parallel IP to that end. We also intend to pursue strategic corporate acquisitions in related fields and technology. We continue our active pursuit of additional debt and equity financing through discussions with investment bankers and private investors.
Our goal on the AERG Strategic Plan is to increase the energy, peak power and frequency agility of USP optical sources while decreasing the size, weight, and cost of these systems. We are in the process of developing this breadth of very high peak power USP lasers and additional optical sources that have a very broad range of applicability for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, commercial, and medical applications. Although the historical market for AERG’s LGE and USP technology is the U.S. Government, the USP technologies are expected to provide numerous platforms for commercial additive and subtractive manufacturing and medical device and imaging markets, creating a substantially larger market for our products to address.
The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic does present unique risks and uncertainties that may alter or otherwise affect our path forward. Our management continues to monitor the possible effects of the COVID-19 on the execution of our plan of operations, our prospective contracts, and the availability of financing to fund our strategic and operational plans going forward. Despite these challenges, we have continued to execute our business development plans and to deliver on our government contracts as per the timeline commitments. In recent months, we have submitted multiple proposals and have been engaged in meetings on a daily and weekly basis with various agencies and departments both remotely and in person in Washington, DC and at various other government facilities. Dr. Quarles, our President and CEO, has continued traveling to the DC area on multiple occasions during the quarter, and remains very committed to briefing our submitted proposals and pursuing this business even in these challenging times.
Through our analysis of the market, and in discussions with potential customers, we would also conclude that customers are becoming more receptive and interested in directed energy technologies. According to the Department of Defense fiscal 2019 budget, its directed energy spending grew from approximately $500 million in 2017 to over $1 billion in 2019, an increase of 100%. The 2020 budget reflected directed energy spending of $1.2 billion, an additional increase of 20% over 2019, and from 2017 through 2020, the directed energy budget grew from approximately $500 million to approximately $1.2 billion, averaging approximately 40% per year. As a result, we continue to be even more optimistic about our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications. As the US Congress finalizes their Appropriations process for the 2021 budget, the AERG team anticipates a continuation of strong funding for the Directed Energy community. With our existing patent portfolio, and through further advancements of our technologies, we believe we have the substantial building blocks needed to become a significant and successful developer in our marketplace.
We look forward to moving into our newly leased office, laboratory and production space, details of which are set forth under Item 1. Business, at UA Tech Park. We believe that this new strategic location will support the company’s anticipated future growth and provide greater capacity for research, product development and production activities. The move, expected to take place starting May 1, 2021, will provide the Company with an ITAR and laser safety compliant facility totaling approximately 13,000 square feet, of which approximately 4,800 square feet is dedicated to a Class 1000 (ISO 6) Cleanroom
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its assumptions on historical experiences and on various other inputs and estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, management considers the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates, the trends in and amounts of these estimates, specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates, and any other relevant matters related to these estimates, including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.
Share-Based Payments
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. We make the following assumptions relative to this model: (i) the annual dividend yield is zero as we do not pay dividends on our common stock, (ii) the weighted-average expected life is based on a midpoint scenario, where the expected life is determined to be half of the time from grant to expiration, regardless of vesting, (iii) the risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security rate for the expected life, and (iv) the volatility is based on the level of fluctuations in our historical share price for a period equal to the weighted-average expected life. We estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and adjust this estimate over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative adjustment, which is recognized in the period of change and which impacts the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized currently for the future tax consequences attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
Results of Operations
Our consolidated financial information for the years ending December 31, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:
Revenue
Revenue increased approximately $176,000 to $176,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the completion of the STTR phase I project.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue increased approximately $154,000 to $154,000 for year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $-0- for year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the completion of the STTR phase I project.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased approximately $76,000 to $4,698,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4,623,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Wages and employee benefits increased $171,000, building costs increased by $58,000, supplies and insurance increased by $18,000, miscellaneous increased by $5,000 and depreciation decreased by $2,000 partially offset by applied project costs decreased by $154,000 and travel decreased by $16,000 and consulting and professional services decreased by approximately $7,000.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and Marketing expenses increased approximately $83,000 to $296,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $214,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the continuation of business development activities through our Master Services Agreement with Westpark Advisors as well as the addition of other consultants in this field
Research and Development
Research and development expenses decreased approximately $69,000 to $267,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $335,000 the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the allocation of part of management’s pay from research and development to consulting expense.
Other Expense
Other income/expense increased approximately $2,400,000 to $2,009,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 partly due to the company receiving $3,000,000 in a litigation settlement. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $809,000 to $1,213,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $404,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the amortization of the notes payable beneficial conversion factor.
Net Loss
Our operations in 2020 resulted in a net loss of approximately $3,230,000, a decrease of approximately $2,326,000 compared to the approximately $5,556,000 net loss for 2019 primarily due to the receipt of a ligation settlement, a decrease in consulting and professional services and applied project costs, partially offset by an increase due to the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature, increases in employee wages and benefits, building costs and supplies and insurance, selling and marketing. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share - basic and diluted decreased to approximately ($0.02) per share.
Trend Discussion
There are obvious costs associated with restarting the corporation and acquiring the skilled leadership and manpower to execute on new product development, as is visible in the higher year-over-year expenses recognized in this Result of Operations. It appears with early 2020 contract booking and the combination of the government slow-down due to COVID-19 impacts that it is too early to determine if efforts to obtain new business under our Teaming and Consulting Agreements could be successful for the next fiscal year. The AERG team has expanded teaming arrangements in 2020, with agreements signed with the three most prominent optics and laser universities in the United States. This should provide greater visibility to government agencies looking for submissions with university/industry partnerships and research alignment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the company incurred a net loss of approximately $3,230,000, had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $160,000 and may incur additional future losses due to the reduction in Government contract activity. At December 31, 2020, the Company had total current assets of approximately $3,400,000 and total current liabilities of approximately $1,800,000 resulting in working capital of approximately $1,600,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash of $3,323,290.
On February 2, 2021 and February 8, 2021, the Company completed the issuance of 7,056,250 total shares of its common stock at a price of $0.32 per share, or $2,258,000 in the aggregate. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash of approximately $4,400,000. Based on the Company’s current business plan, it believes its cash balance as of the date of this filing will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that the current business plan will be achievable. Such conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued.
The company’s existence is dependent upon management’s ability to develop profitable operations. Management is devoting substantially all of its efforts to developing its business and raising capital and there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts will be successful. No assurance can be given that management’s actions will result in profitable operations or the resolution of its liquidity problems. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic contributes to this uncertainty.
In order to improve the company’s liquidity, the company’s management is actively pursuing additional equity financing through discussions with investment bankers and private investors. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its effort to secure additional equity financing.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amount or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $3,323,000 of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of approximately $3,235,000 from December 31, 2019. In 2020, we used approximately $160,000 in operating activities, comprised primarily of our net loss of $3,230,000, a decrease in accounts payable of $232,000, gain on settlement of accrued compensation of $206,000, a decrease in accrued interest of $90,000, an increase in prepaid expenses and deposits of $44,000, a decrease in accrued expenses of $23,000, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1,501,000, amortization of future compensation payable of $833,000, amortization of beneficial conversion feature of $919,000, common stock issued for interest expenses of $229,000, amortization of prepaid assets of $150,000, depreciation and amortization of $17,000, a decrease in accounts receivable of $10,000, and a reduction in inventory of $6,000.
We had approximately $3,395,000 provided by financing activities comprised of proceeds from note payable of $4,324,000, $1,644,000 provided from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock, proceeds from Cares Act PPP loan of $133,000 and $75,000 provided from the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants, partially offset by the repayment on notes payable $1,373,000, the purchase and cancellation of stock of $1,300,000 and repayment of insurance premium loan of $108,000. All this resulted in a net cash inflow of approximately $3,395,000.
As of March 26, 2021, our backlog (that is, workload remaining on signed contracts) was approximately $-0- to be completed within the next twelve months.
As of March 31, 2021, the company had a cash balance of $4,261,000.
Contractual Obligations:
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020:
Not included in the above table are the dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock that are approximately $34,000 each year (approximately $9,000 each quarter), assuming no conversion of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock.
Operating Leases
We are operating in leased premises under month-to-month operating leases. Total rent expense on these spaces amounted to approximately $49,000 for 2020 and $30,000 for 2019. The increase in lease expenses is due to the lease of the lab space transitioned in the AOS asset acquisition.
Preferred Stock
The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock bears dividends at an initial rate of 6.5% of the liquidation preference per share per annum, which accrues from the date of issuance, and is payable quarterly. We have not paid dividends commencing with the quarterly dividend due August 1, 2013 and, as a result, the dividend rate has increased to 10% per annum and will remain at that level until such failure is cured. Dividends due as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $261,000.
The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have a right to put the stock to the company for an aggregate amount equal to the liquidation preference (approximately $340,000) plus unpaid dividends of $261,000, as of December 31, 2020, in the event of a change in control. Dividends are payable in: (i) cash, (ii) shares of our common stock (valued for such purpose at 95% of the weighted average of the last sales prices of our common stock for each of the trading days in the ten trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the applicable dividend payment date), provided that the issuance and/or resale of all such shares of our common stock are then covered by an effective registration statement or (iii) any combination of the foregoing. As of December 31, 2020, there were 13,602 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases. For a description of our operating lease, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
