Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation in November 2017 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination.
On August 28, 2018, the Company consummated its IPO of 15,000,000 units (the “Initial Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one warrant of the Company (“Public Warrant”), with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters in the IPO a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-Allotment Units”). On September 21, 2018, the underwriters exercised the option in part and purchased an aggregate of 1,928,889 Over-Allotment Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $19,288,890.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 6,560,000 warrants (“Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $6,560,000. On September 21, 2018, in connection with the sale of Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 385,778 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $385,778.
A total of $170,981,779, (or $10.10 per Unit) comprised of $164,036,001 of the proceeds from the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units) and $6,945,778 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
Our Units began trading on August 24, 2018 on the NYSE under the symbol MFAC.U. Commencing on September 21, 2018, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock, and warrants are trading on the NYSE under the symbols “MFAC.U,” “MFAC” and “MFAC.W,” respectively.
On May 26, 2020, our stockholders voted to amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Transfer Agent”) to extend the date on which we would have to complete an initial business combination to August 28, 2020 (or November 30, 2020 if the Company had executed a definitive agreement for an initial business combination by August 28, 2020). In connection with the stockholder vote, stockholders redeemed 13,733,885 of the shares of our Class A common stock, leaving approximately $33,167,514 in our Trust Account.
On August 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Megalith, MFAC Merger Sub Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and (“Merger Sub”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Megalith, BankMobile Technologies, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (“BankMobile”) and Customers Bank, a Pennsylvania state chartered bank and the sole stockholder of BankMobile. The Merger Agreement was subsequently amended on November 2, 2020 and December 8, 2020 by the parties and Customers Bancorp, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation.
Subsequent Events
On January 4, 2021, the Company consummated the business combination (as defined below), pursuant to which the Company acquired BankMobile (the acquisition is referred to herein as the “business combination”). In connection with the closing of the business combination (the “Closing”), pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into BankMobile, with Merger Sub surviving the merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and in connection therewith the Company changed its name from Megalith Financial Acquisition Corporation to BM Technologies, Inc. (the “Merger”).
In connection with the business combination, 500 shares of Class A common stock were redeemed at a per share price of approximately $10.42. Upon the Closing, the Company had 12,200,302 shares of common stock outstanding.
Further information regarding the business combination and the Company is set forth in (i) the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 11, 2020 (the “Proxy Statement”) and (ii) the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 8, 2021.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues through December 31, 2020. Our only activities from inception through December 31, 2020 were organizational activities, efforts relating to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination and the acquisition of BankMobile. We generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash marketable securities held in the Trust Account.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net (loss) of $(890,699) which consists of operating costs of $2,210,594 and a provision for income taxes of $297,748, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,405,514 and other income of $212,129.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had net income of $2,363,522 which consists of operating costs of $799,387 and a provision for income taxes of $788,018, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $3,950,927.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The completion of the Initial Public Offering and simultaneous Private Placement, inclusive of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, generated gross proceeds to the Company of $170,981,779. Related transaction costs amounted to $10,521,211, consisting of $3,192,889 of underwriting fees, $6,771,556 of deferred underwriting commissions payable (which are held in the Trust Account) and $556,766 of other costs.
As of December 31, 2020, $43,178 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account and was available for working capital purposes, including paying business, legal and accounting due diligence costs on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses.
Following the Initial Public Offering and the exercise of the over-allotment option, a total of $170,981,778 was placed in the Trust Account and we had $1,785,062 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of all costs related to the Initial Public Offering and the exercise of the over-allotment option.
Off-balance sheet financing arrangements
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii). We are not a party to any transaction that creates relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Related Party
The Company paid an entity affiliated with the President a fee of approximately $16,667 per month until the consummation of the Business Combination. A bonus of $78,000 was paid out after the successful completion of the Initial Public Offering.
Contractual obligations
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than the deferred underwriter commission discussed above, payment to an entity affiliated with the President a fee of approximately $16,667 per month until the consummation of the Business Combination, as well as a bonus of $78,000 which was paid out after the successful completion of the Initial Public Offering, and an agreement to pay the sponsor a monthly fee of $2,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on August 24, 2018 and continued to incur these fees monthly until through October 31, 2020 for the office space and November 15, 2020 for the fee to the entity affiliated with the President.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
