ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations together with and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Overview
We are a lifestyle branding company with expertise in developing, from inception to completion, and branding alcoholic beverages for ourselves and third parties. We market and place products into national distribution through long-standing industry relationships. We believe we are a leader in “Celebrity Branding” of beverages in which we procure superior and unique products from around the world and brand such products with internationally-recognized celebrities. We currently market and sell the following products:
·
Bellissima Prosecco - these products comprise a line of all-natural and Vegan Prosecco and Sparkling Wine made with organic grapes, including a Zero Sugar, Zero Carb option, a DOC Brut and a Sparkling Rose;
·
Bella Sprizz Apertifs - these products comprise a line of aperitifs consisting of three different expressions, a classic Italian aperitif an all-natural elderflower aperitif and a classic Italian bitter; and
·
Hooters Spirits - these products comprise a line of private-label premium spirits that are sold under the Hooters brand. The full line of Hooters Spirits includes Vodka, Gin, Rum (Dark & Light), Tequila (Silver & Gold), American Whiskey and Hooters Heat Cinnamon Whiskey.
In addition, we also develop private label spirits for established domestic and international chains.
Our mission is to be an industry leader in brand development, marketing, and sales of alcoholic beverages by capitalizing on our ability to procure products from around the world. We plan to leverage our relationships with internationally-recognized celebrities to add value to products and create brand awareness in unbranded niche categories.
We market and sell a line of line of all-natural and Vegan Prosecco and Sparkling Wine made with organic grapes, including a Zero Sugar, Zero Carb option, a DOC Brut and a Sparkling Rose, pursuant to a License Agreement entered into between our majority-owned (51%) subsidiary, Bellissima Spirits LLC and Christie Brinkley, Inc., an entity owned by supermodel and entrepreneur Christie Brinkley.
We also market and sell a Vodka product, under the brand “BiVi 100 percent Sicilian Vodka,” pursuant to a License Agreement entered into between our majority-owned (51%) subsidiary, BiVi LLC and Neighborhood Licensing, LLC, an entity owned by Chazz Palminteri.
In addition, we market and sell a line of private-label premium spirits under the Hooters brand, including Vodka, Gin, Rum (Dark & Light), Tequila (Silver & Gold), American Whiskey and Hooters Heat Cinnamon Whiskey, pursuant to a Marketing and Distribution Agreement entered into between us and United Spirits, Inc., a company owned and managed by Richard DeCicco, the controlling shareholder, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company, which we treat as a variable interest entity.
Recent Developments
As a result of COVID-19, we have seen a shift away from the traditional brick-and-mortar business to a direct-to-consumer business. Although we expect brick-and-mortar to rebound, we also expect the director-to-consumer model to stay post-COVID-19, as consumers embrace the convenience of having their alcoholic beverages delivered to their doorstep. As we expand our relationship with QVC and our own direct-to-consumer platform through our website, we believe we are well positioned to execute on this opportunity.
Series G Preferred Stock Financing
On January 12, 2020, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain accredited investors for the sale of an aggregate of 1,500 shares of our Series G Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase up to 1,200,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $1,500,000, before deducting placement agent and other offering expenses.
Going Concern
As a result of our current financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, we must effectively balance many factors and generate more revenue so that we can fund our operations from our sales and revenues. If we are not able to do this, we may not be able to continue as an operating company. Until we can grow revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, we must continue to raise capital by issuing debt or through the sale of our stock. There is no assurance that our cash flow will be adequate to satisfy our operating expenses and capital requirements.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Introduction
We had sales of $2,848,913 and $1,210,242 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our cost of sales were $1,330,441 and $734,428 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our operating expenses were $4,716,564 and $3,807,114, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our operating expenses consisted mostly of professional fees, royalties and fulfilment costs along with marketing and advertising costs, occupancy costs, and travel and entertainment.
Revenues and Net Operating Loss
Our revenues, operating expenses, and net operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
Sales
Our sales are comprised of sales of BiVi Sicilian Vodka and Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wine and our newly-introduced line of Hooters Spirits. Sales were $2,848,913 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,210,242 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,638,671, or 135%. The $1,638,671 increase in sales in 2020 over 2019 was primarily due to a $1,632,000 increase in sales of Bellissima Prosecco through the QVC sales channel.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,330,441 compared to $734,428 during the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $596,013. Cost of sales includes the cost of the products purchased from our Italian suppliers, freight-in costs and import duties. The cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 46.7% as compared to 60.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was due to the increase in sales through the QVC channel, which has lower costs, However, as discussed below, there are now fulfillment costs associated with sales through the QVC channel that are specific to that sales distribution effort.
Officers Compensation
Officers compensation for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $415,000compared to $497,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $82,000 or 16%. The decrease relates to payments made to other officers in 2019 who were not employed by us in 2020.
Effective April 1, 2018, we executed Employment Agreements with our Chief Executive Officer Richard DeCicco (“DeCicco”) and its Vice President of Sales and Marketing Roseann Faltings (“Faltings”). Both agreements have a term of 24 months (to March 31, 2020). The DeCicco Employment Agreement provides for a base salary at the rate of $265,000 per annum and a compensation stock award of 300,000 shares of Iconic common stock (the “DeCicco Award”) issuable upon the effective date of the planned reverse stock split. The DeCicco Award has not been issued as of the date of this Annual Report, but the Company still intends to issue such award. The Faltings Employment Agreement provides for a base salary at the rate of $150,000 per annum and a compensation stock award of 100,000 shares of Iconic common stock (the “Faltings Award”) issuable upon the effective date of the planned reverse stock split. The Faltings Award has not been issued as of the date of this Annual Report, but the Company still intends to issue such award. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we have accrued a total of $415,000 officers compensation pursuant to these two Employment Agreements. In 2019, the accrued compensation was allocated 50% to Iconic ($207,500), 40% to Bellissima ($166,000), and 10% to BiVi ($41,500).
Fulfillment Costs
We had fulfillment costs of $536,255 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $536,255. Fulfilment coats are specifically related to sales made through the QVC Channel and included storage and distribution to the consumer.
Royalties
We expensed royalties of $497,253, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $198,002 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $299,251, or 151%. Royalties increased due to primarily to minimum royalties associated with the Hooters product brand.
Professional and Consulting Fees
Professional and consulting fees expense was $962,481, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,260,343, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $297,862, or approximately 24%.
Professional and consulting fees consist primarily of legal and, accounting and auditing services. The decrease of approximately $297,862 from 2019 to 2020 was related to the acquisition of CANB Corp (“CANB”) in 2019 and related financing activities that did not occur in 2020. We pursued various acquisition opportunities in 2020 that did not result in a completed transaction, which caused our expenses for professional fees to remain at a high level.
Marketing and Advertising
Marketing and advertising expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $801,445 compared to $512,707 during the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $288,738, or 56%. The increase in marketing and advertising expense was primarily related to marketing fees in the QVC sales channel.
Travel and Entertainment
Travel and entertainment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $41,208 compared to $319,483 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $278,275 or about 87%. The decrease was a result of limited travel during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 environment.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses were $1,462,922 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,019,576 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $443,346, or approximately 44%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses included investor relations, automobile, insurance, office expenses and expenses relating to Christie Brinkley appearances at Bellissima promotions. In addition, we hired four employees to assist with the planned growth of our company.
Net Operating Income/Loss
Net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,198,092 compared to net operating loss of $3,331,297 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $133,205. Net operating (loss) decreased , as set forth above, primarily because sales increased, offset by increases in the various expense categories.
Loss on investment
On July 29, 2020, we executed an Exchange Agreement with CANB and delivered the 543,714 shares of CANB common stock to CANB in exchange for CANB’s delivery to us of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. The July 29, 2020 closing price of the CANB common stock was $0.95 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized treasury stock in the amount of $516,528 and we recognized a loss of $483,472 from our investment in CANB common stock.
Net Loss attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries and Variable Interest Entity
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and variable interest entity represented 49% of the net loss of Bellissima and BiVi (of which we own 51%) and 100% of United Spirits (of which we own 0%) and is accounted for as a reduction in the net loss attributable to our company. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $109,962 compared to a net loss of $424,599 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease in the loss of $314,637. Net loss attributable to Iconic Brands decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of all the changes discussed above.
Loss from Discontinued Operations
Effective December 31, 2019, we sold our 51% equity interest in Green Grow Farms, Inc. (“Green Grow”) to Can B Corp. in exchange for 37,500,000 shares of Can B Corp. common stock and a Can B Corp. obligation to issue additional shares (“Additional Purchases Shares”) of Can B Corp. common stock to the Company on June 30, 2020 in such number so that the aggregate value of the aggregate shares issued to the Company equals $1,000,000. We acquired this equity interest on May 9, 2019 in exchange for a $200,000 note payable to NY Farms Group Inc. and 2,000,000 shares of Company common stock valued at $1,250,000
The loss from operations during the time of ownership and the subsequent sale of the operation resulted in a loss from discontinued operations of $1,047,213 for the year ended December 31, 2019. There was no loss from discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Income/Loss
Net loss attributable to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,571,602, or $(.22) per share, compared to a net loss of $3,953,911, or $(0.37) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease in the loss of $382,309. Net (loss) decreased, as set forth above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
During the year ended December 31, 2020, because we did not generate sufficient revenue, we had negative operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2020 was $457,041. Our average monthly cash flow burn rate for 2020 was approximately $200,000. We have high cash needs in the short term, and as our operating expenses increase, we will face strong to medium long term cash needs. We do not anticipate that our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs for the next year, and if revenues do not keep up with our expenses, it will be necessary to seek other methods to finance our operations and any growth opportunities, including the sale of convertible debt and equity securities.
Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are as follows:
Our total current assets decreased by approximately $112,000 from the prior year primarily due to an increase in cash of $194,000 offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of $261,000 (see footnotes to the financial statements). Our total current liabilities increased primarily due to a $1,043,000 increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily related to royalties and professional fees.(see the footnotes to the financial statements attached). Our working capital deficit increased from $617,491 at December 31, 2019 to $1,884,016 at December 31, 2020.
We hope that the revenues we generate from sales of our products will be able to satisfy our obligations in full without the need to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts. Please see the “ Risk Factors ” beginning on page 12.
Cash Requirements
Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2020 was $457,041. We anticipate that the funding from financing activities and product sales will be enough to sustain us for the next 12 months.
