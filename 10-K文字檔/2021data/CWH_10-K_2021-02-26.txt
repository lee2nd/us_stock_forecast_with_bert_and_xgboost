ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in other parts of this Form 10-K. Except to the extent that differences among reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis.
For purposes of this Form 10-K, we define an "Active Customer" as a customer who has transacted with us in any of the eight most recently completed fiscal quarters prior to the date of measurement. Unless otherwise indicated, the date of measurement is December 31, 2020, our most recently completed fiscal quarter.
In this Item 7, we discuss the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and comparisons of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019. Discussions of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and comparisons of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 28, 2020.
Overview
Camping World Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries) is America’s largest retailer of recreational RVs and related products and services. Our vision is to build a long-term legacy business that makes RVing fun and easy, and our Camping World and Good Sam brands have been serving RV consumers since 1966. We strive to build long-term value for our customers, employees, and shareholders by combining a unique and comprehensive assortment of RV products and services with a national network of RV dealerships, service centers and customer support centers along with the industry’s most extensive online presence and a highly-trained and knowledgeable team of associates serving our customers, the RV lifestyle, and the communities in which we operate. We also believe that our Good Sam organization and family of programs and services uniquely enables us to connect with our customers as stewards of the RV lifestyle. On December 31, 2020, we operated a total of 171 retail locations, with 170 of these selling and/or servicing RVs. See Note 1 ─ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ─ Description of the Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
With the COVID-19 crisis (see “COVID-19” below) causing many state and local governments to issue “stay-at-home” and “shelter-in-place” restrictions in mid-to-late March, sales and traffic levels across the RV industry declined significantly in March 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many RV manufacturers, including Thor Industries, Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, temporarily suspended production from late March to mid-May. This led to a 44.6% decrease in wholesale shipments of new RVs for the three month period of March, April, and May 2020, according to the RV Industry Association’s survey of manufacturers. The Company had taken steps to add new private label lines, expand its relationships with smaller RV manufacturers, and acquire used inventory from distressed sellers to help manage risks in its supply chain. In conjunction with the stay-at-home and shelter-in-place restrictions enacted in many areas, the Company saw significant sequential declines in its overall customer traffic levels and its overall revenues from the mid-March to mid-to-late April 2020 timeframe. In the latter part of April, the Company began to see significant improvements in its online web traffic levels and number of electronic leads, and in early May, the Company began to see improvements in its overall revenue levels. As the stay-at-home restrictions began to ease across certain areas of the country, the Company experienced significant acceleration in its in-store and online traffic, lead generation, and revenue trends in May continuing throughout the remainder of 2020 and early indications appear to show favorable trends continuing into 2021.
On September 15, 2020 we announced a number of initiatives heading into 2021, including plans to launch a peer-to-peer RV rental service, and a mobile RV technician marketplace, as well as plans to acquire RV dealerships. These initiatives continue to keep RVs as the focal point while expanding our value proposition to the customer and, in particular, to our 2.1 million active Good Sam members.
Segments
We operate two reportable segments: (i) Good Sam Services and Plans, and (ii) RV and Outdoor Retail. We identify our reporting segments based on the organizational units used by management to monitor performance and make operating decisions. The Company previously had three reportable segments: (i) Consumer Services and Plans; (ii) Dealership, and (iii) Retail. In the first quarter of 2019, we realigned the structure of our internal organization in a manner that caused the composition of our reportable segments to change. Our reportable segment financial information has been recast to reflect the updated reportable segment structure for all periods presented. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Description of the Business and Note 22 - Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding our reportable segments.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we generated 3.3%, 3.7%, and 3.6% of our total revenue and 6.4%, 7.9%, and 7.1% of our total gross profit from our Good Sam Services and Plans segment, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we generated 96.7%, 96.3%, and 96.4% of our total revenue and 93.6%, 92.1%, and 92.9% of our total gross profit from our RV and Outdoor Retail segment, respectively.
COVID-19
As discussed in Note 1 ─ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ─ COVID-19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our business from mid-March through much of April 2020, but shifted to a favorable impact beginning primarily in May 2020.
In response to the pandemic, we have implemented preparedness plans to keep our employees and customers safe, which include social distancing, providing employees with face coverings and/or other protective clothing as required, implementing additional cleaning and sanitization routines, and work-from-home orders for a significant portion of our workforce. The majority of our retail locations have continued to operate as essential businesses and consequently have remained open to serve our customers through the pandemic, and we continue to operate our e-commerce business. As of December 31, 2020, we have temporarily closed two of our dealerships as a result of COVID-19 and branding changes. These two dealerships are expected to reopen in 2021. We temporarily reduced salaries and hours throughout the Company, including for our executive officers and implemented headcount and other cost reductions primarily from the middle of March 2020 through the middle of May 2020, in an attempt to better align expenses with the initially expected reduced sales resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Most of these temporary salary reductions ended in May 2020 as the adverse impacts of the pandemic began to decline and we increased hours for certain employees and reinstated many positions from the initial headcount reductions as the demand for our products increased.
In conjunction with the stay-at-home and shelter-in-place restrictions enacted in many areas, we saw significant sequential declines in overall customer traffic levels and overall revenues from the mid-March to mid-to-late April 2020 timeframe. In the latter part of April, we began to see a significant improvement in online web traffic levels, and in early May, we began to see improvements in overall revenue levels. As the stay-at-home restrictions began to ease across certain areas of the country, we experienced significant acceleration in our in-store traffic and revenue trends in May and continuing throughout the remainder of 2020 and early indications appear to show favorable trends continuing into 2021. We believe that the demand will remain elevated as consumers continue to view RVs as an opportunity to work and school remotely.
We have been implementing marketing and operational plans to optimize our leadership position through the pandemic, regardless of the ultimate timing and slope of the recovery curve. We have adapted our sales practices to accommodate customers’ safety concerns in this COVID-19 environment, such as offering virtual tours of RVs and providing home delivery options. As a consequence of COVID-19, we held fewer consumer shows and events during 2020 than in 2019 and we debuted our first virtual show in 2020.
If stay-at-home and shelter-in-place restrictions are put back into place or as other modes of transportation and vacation options recover from the impact of COVID-19, the increased demand for our products may not be sustained. We are unable to accurately quantify the future impact that COVID-19 may have on our business, results of operations and liquidity due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, including additional waves of infection and the effectiveness and availability of vaccines, the economic impact of the pandemic, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and other as yet unanticipated consequences. In addition, there could be weakening demand for items that are not basic goods, and our supply chain could be disrupted in the future as a result of the outbreak, such as if Thor Industries, Inc. were to again close its North American production facilities as it did from late March to early May 2020. Any of these events could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results.
Key Performance Indicators
We evaluate the results of our overall business based on a variety of factors, including the number of Active Customers and Good Sam members, revenue and same store revenue, vehicle units, and same store vehicle units, gross profit and gross profit per vehicle sold, gross margin, finance and insurance per vehicle (“PV”), vehicle inventory turnover, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Sales of new vehicles generally result in a lower gross profit margin than other areas of our business, including used vehicles, repair service and installation work, RV equipment and accessories, outdoor equipment and accessories and finance and insurance products.
Same store revenue. Same store revenue measures the performance of a retail location during the current reporting period against the performance of the same retail location in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our same store revenue calculations for a given period include only those stores that were open both at the end of the corresponding period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had a base of 142, 132, and 118 same stores, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 our aggregate same store revenue was $4.5 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.9 billion, respectively. With same store revenue driven by the number of transactions and the average transaction price, changes in our mix of new vehicle sales has and will likely continue to negatively impact our new vehicle same store revenue. Over the past several years, we have seen a shift in our overall mix of new RV sales towards travel trailer vehicles, which tend to carry lower average selling prices than other classes of new RV vehicles. From 2015 to 2020, new vehicle travel trailer units have increased from 62% to 74% of total new vehicle unit sales and the average selling price of a new vehicle unit has declined from $39,853 to $36,277. The increased popularity of new travel trailer vehicles and the lower price points of these units compared to other new vehicle classes such as motorhomes and fifth wheels could continue to lower our average selling price of a new vehicle unit and impact our same store revenue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margins. Gross profit is our total revenue less our total costs applicable to revenue. Our total costs applicable to revenue primarily consists of the cost of goods and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue.
Our gross profit is variable in nature and generally follows changes in our revenue. While gross margins for our RV and Outdoor Retail segment are lower than gross margins for our Good Sam Services and Plans, this segment generates significant gross profit and is our primary means of acquiring new customers, to whom we then cross sell our higher margin products and services with recurring revenue. We believe the overall growth of our RV and Outdoor Retail segments will allow us to continue to drive growth in gross profit due to our ability to cross sell our Good Sam Services and Plans to our increasing Active Customer base. Gross margin in our RV and Outdoor Retail segment was negatively impacted in 2018 and 2017 by the opening of Gander Outdoors locations and in 2019 by the 2019 Strategic Shift.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are some of the primary metrics management uses to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are also frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP metrics. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:
•
as a measurement of operating performance to assist us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis, and remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations;
•
for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections; and
• to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies.
For the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net income margin, and a further discussion of how we utilize these non-GAAP financial measures and their limitations, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Industry Trends
After several years of strong growth, the overall RV industry experienced decelerating demand for new vehicles in 2018 and 2019. Along with the decelerating demand trends, wholesale shipments of new RV vehicles declined 16.0% in 2019 according to the RV Industry Association’s survey of manufacturers. In late 2019, the demand for new RVs across the overall RV industry began improving. Wholesale shipments of new RVs increased 13.2% in the first two months of 2020 according to the RV Industry Association’s survey of manufacturers but then there was a six to eight week shutdown by RV manufacturers last spring which resulted in an 18.7% decrease in wholesale shipments for the first half of 2020. Wholesale shipments of RVs for the second half of 2020 increased 34.2% over the comparable period in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020 total RV shipments increased 6.0% versus the comparable period in 2019, with the travel trailer group showing the largest increase.
With the COVID-19 crisis causing many state and local governments to issue “stay-at-home” and “shelter-in-place” restrictions in mid-to-late March, sales and traffic levels across the RV industry declined significantly in April 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many RV manufacturers, including Thor Industries, Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, temporarily suspended production from late March to mid-May. This led to a 44.6% decrease in wholesale shipments of new RVs for the three month period of March, April, and May 2020, according to the RV Industry Association’s survey of manufacturers.
Longer term, however, we believe the increase in the number of light-weight towable RV models offered by the manufacturers, the increase in the number of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in operation, the ease of towing, the affordability of many of the light-weight RVs, the savings RVs offer on a variety of vacation costs, an increase in the pool of potential RV customers due to an aging baby boomer and millennial demographic, and the increased RV ownership among younger consumers are positive long-term secular trends driving the growth of the RV industry and the installed base of RV owners.
In addition, we believe the growth in the number of U.S. camping households bodes well for the long-term growth of the RV industry. The 2020 North American Camping Report estimated that the total number of camping households in the U.S. has increased by more than 9.7 million over the past six years to 82 million. Campers are increasing the amount of time they camp each year, with the number of campers who camp three times or more each year increasing by 82% since 2014. Over the past six years, an increasing number of campers have said that they use an RV as their primary camping accommodation. From 2014 to 2019, the number of campers using an RV to camp increased from 21% to an estimated 27%.
Finally, the camping and RV industry are expected to benefit from Baby Boomers reaching retirement age and Generation X and Millennial consumers reaching their prime camping age, which is generally considered between the ages of 30 and 50. According to U. S. Census Bureau data in the 2019 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, the population for the ages of 20 and 34 were estimated at 67 million individuals and the population between the ages of 50 and 69 were estimated at 80 million individuals in the United States.
Strategic Shift
In 2019, we made a strategic decision to refocus our business around our core RV competencies. In connection with the 2019 Strategic Shift, we recorded restructuring charges of $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $19.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. In total, we expect to incur costs relating to one-time employee termination benefits of $1.2 million, all of which has been incurred through December 31, 2020, lease termination costs of between $18.0 million and $32.0 million, incremental inventory reserve charges of $42.4 million all of which has been incurred through December 31, 2020, and other associated costs of between $28.0 million and $35.0 million. Through December 31, 2019, we incurred $21.2 million of such other associated costs primarily representing labor, lease, and other operating expenses incurred during the post-close wind-down period for the locations related to the 2019 Strategic Shift. The additional amount of $6.8 million to $13.8 million represents similar costs that may be incurred in the year ending December 31, 2021 for locations that continue in a wind-down period, primarily comprised of lease costs accounted for under ASC No. 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) prior to lease termination. We intend to negotiate terminations of these leases where prudent and pursue sublease arrangements for the remaining leases. Lease costs may continue to be incurred after December 31, 2020 on these leases if we are unable to terminate the leases under acceptable terms or offset the lease costs through sublease arrangements. The foregoing lease termination cost estimate represents the expected cash payments to terminate certain leases, but does not include the gain or loss from derecognition of the related operating lease assets and liabilities, which is dependent on the particular leases that will be terminated. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The following table details the costs incurred associated with the 2019 Strategic Shift (in thousands):
(1)
These costs incurred in 2020 were primarily included in costs applicable to revenues - products, service and other in the consolidated statements of operations. These costs incurred in 2019 were primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
(2)
These costs were included in lease termination charges in the consolidated statements of operations. This reflects termination fees paid, net of any gain from derecognition of the related operating lease assets and liabilities.
(3)
These costs were included in costs applicable to revenue - products, service and other in the consolidated statements of operations.
(4)
Other associated costs primarily represent labor, lease, and other operating expenses incurred during the post-close wind-down period for the locations related to the 2019 Strategic Shift. For the year ended December 31, 2020, costs of approximately $0.4 million were included in costs applicable to revenue - products, service and other, and $16.4 million were included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

The following tables set forth information comparing the components of net income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
nm- not meaningful
Supplemental Data
(1) Front end yield is calculated as gross profit from new vehicles, used vehicles and finance and insurance (net), divided by combined new and used retail unit revenue.
(2) Inventory turnover calculated as vehicle costs applicable to revenue divided by the average of beginning and ending vehicle inventory.
(3) An Active Customer is a customer who has transacted with us in any of the eight most recently completed fiscal quarters prior to the date of measurement.
Total revenue was $5.4 billion for 2020, an increase of $554.6 million, or 11.3%, from $4.9 billion for 2019. The increase in total revenue was driven by a $553.1 million, or 11.7%, increase in RV and Outdoor Retail revenue, and a $1.4 million, or 0.8%, increase in Good Sam Services and Plans revenue.
Total gross profit was $1.7 billion for 2020, an increase of $415.1 million, or 32.2%, from $1.3 billion for 2019. The increase in total gross profit was driven by a $408.5 million, or 34.4%, increase in RV and Outdoor Retail gross profit, and a $6.6 million, or 6.5%, increase in Good Sam Services and Plans gross profit.
Income from operations was $476.2 million for 2020, an increase of $467.4 million from $8.7 million for 2019. The increase in income from operations was primarily driven by a $415.1 million increase in gross profit, a $53.9 million decrease in long-lived asset impairment, a decrease of approximately $10.1 million in loss on disposal of assets, and a decrease of approximately $7.9 million in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase of $14.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and a $5.2 million increase in lease termination expense.
Total other expenses were $74.2 million for 2020, a decrease of $25.2 million, or 25.4% from $99.5 billion for 2019. The decrease in other expenses was driven by a $20.4 million decrease in floor plan interest expense, and a $14.7 million decrease in other interest expense, partially offset by a $9.9 million favorable adjustment in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability in 2019, which did not reoccur in 2020.
As a result of the above factors, income before income taxes was $402.0 million for 2020 compared to loss before income taxes of $90.7 million for 2019. Income tax expense was $57.7 million for 2020, an increase of $28.2 million from $29.6 million for 2019. As a result, net income was $344.2 million for 2020 compared to net loss of $120.3 million for 2019.
Good Sam Services and Plans
Good Sam Services and Plans revenue was $181.0 million for 2020, an increase of $1.4 million, or 0.8%, from $179.5 million for 2019. The $1.4 million increase was primarily attributable to $2.4 million from increased contracts in force from our roadside assistance programs, $1.8 million from increased contracts in force for our extended vehicle warranty programs, $1.6 million from increased contracts in force for our vehicle insurance products, and $1.1 million from increased RV financing loan volume, partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease from 13 fewer consumer shows, and decreases in advertising revenue of $1.4 million from the magazine group and $1.7 million for the annual directory.
Good Sam Services and Plans gross profit was $108.0 million for 2020, an increase of $6.6 million, or 6.5%, from $101.5 million for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to $4.2 million from increased policies in force and reduced marketing expenses for our extended vehicle programs, $3.2 million of increased policies in force and reduced program expenses in our roadside assistance programs, and $1.2 million from increased loan volume for our RV financing, partially offset by $1.1 million of reduced gross profit from reduced consumer shows, $0.8 million from the annual directory and $0.1 million from other services and plans.
RV and Outdoor Retail:
New Vehicles
New vehicle revenue was $2.8 billion for 2020, an increase of $453.0 million, or 19.1%, from $2.4 billion for 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 17.7% increase in vehicle units sold and a 1.2% increase in
average selling price per vehicle, driven by increases in nearly all product types. On a same store basis, new vehicle revenue increased 15.4% to $2.6 billion in 2020 from $2.2 billion in 2019.
New vehicle gross profit increased 69.8%, or $206.7 million, to $502.8 million for 2020 from $296.1 million for 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 44.3% increase in average gross profit per vehicle sold and by a 17.7% increase in vehicle units sold. Gross margin increased 532 basis points to 17.8% in 2020 from 12.5% in 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher towable and motorized gross margins resulting from lower supply from manufacturers and outsized demand from consumers turning to RVing as a vacation alternative.
Used Vehicles
Used vehicle revenue increased 14.8%, or $127.2 million, to $984.9 million for 2020 from $857.6 million for 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 10.1% increase in average selling price per vehicle sold, and a 4.3% increase in vehicle units sold, driven mostly by towable units where a dip in trade-in rates through a portion of the year compressed inventory levels while product demand remained high. On a same store basis, used vehicle revenue increased 10.0% to $911.3 million in 2020 from $828.3 million in 2019.
Used vehicle gross profit increased 30.6%, or $54.8 million, to $223.8 million in 2020 from $179.0 million in 2019. The increase was primarily from a 25.3% increase in average gross profit per vehicle sold and a 4.3% increase in vehicle units sold. Used vehicle gross margin increased 287 basis points to 23.7% in 2020 from 20.9% in 2019. The increase was driven by nearly all types of towable units as a result of strength in the used market.
Products, Service and Other
Products, service and other revenue decreased 8.3%, or $85.7 million, to $948.9 million in 2020 from $1.0 billion in 2019. The decrease was driven by store closures related to the 2019 Strategic Shift, partially offset by improvements in same store sales. On a same store basis, products, service and other revenue increased 13.5% to $594.1 million for 2020 from $523.3 million in 2019.
Products, service and other gross profit increased 31.8%, or $86.5 million, to $358.2 million in 2020 from $271.7 million in 2019. The increase was driven by the 2019 Strategic Shift inventory liquidation charge of $27.3 million in 2019 and improved margin at the remaining locations. Product, service and other gross margin increased to 37.7% in 2020 from 26.3% in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a sales mix shift towards higher margin legacy RV products and the 2019 Strategic Shift inventory liquidation charge of $27.3 million in 2019.
Finance and Insurance, net
Finance and insurance, net revenue increased 15.7%, or $63.0 million to $464.3 million in 2020 from $401.3 million for 2019, primarily due to increased volume of vehicles sold. Finance and insurance, net as a percentage of new and used vehicle revenue decreased to 12.2% for 2020 from 12.4% for 2019. On a same store basis, finance and insurance, net revenue increased 12.2%, or $46.4 million, to $426.2 million in 2020 versus $379.8 million in 2019.
Good Sam Club
Good Sam Club revenue decreased 8.9%, or $4.4 million, to $44.3 million in 2020 from $48.7 million in 2019. The decrease resulted from a reduced number of members and reduced royalty fees from the credit card related to fewer retail locations that resulted from store closures related to the 2019 Strategic Shift.
Good Sam Club gross profit decreased 6.6%, or $2.5 million, to $35.4 million in 2020 from $37.9 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a reduced number of members from the decreased number of stores as a result of the store closures related to the 2019 Strategic Shift. Gross margin increased to 79.9% in 2020 from 77.9% in 2019 primarily due to reduced club marketing expenses.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.3%, or $14.4 million, to $1.2 billion in 2020 from $1.1 billion for 2019. The $14.4 million increase was primarily due to a $46.7 million increase in wage-related expenses attributable in large part to variable pay on increased gross profit, partially offset by an $18.1 million decrease in advertising as the Company shifted towards a more digitally-driven marketing approach, $8.1 million decrease in personal and real property expense primarily due to closed stores as a result of the 2019 Strategic Shift, and a $6.1 million decrease in other store and corporate overhead expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total gross profit decreased to 67.9% in 2020 from 88.7% in 2019.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased 13.3%, or $8.0 million, to $52.0 million in 2020 from $59.9 million for 2019 due to reduction in capital expenditures in 2020 and the asset impairment related to the 2019 Strategic Shift in 2019.
Long-lived asset impairment
As discussed in Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we recognized $12.4 million of long-lived asset impairments in 2020, of which $12.3 million related to the 2019 Strategic Shift discussed above, and $66.3 million of long-lived asset impairments during 2019, of which $57.4 million was related to the 2019 Strategic Shift.
Lease termination
Lease termination expense increased $5.2 million to $4.5 million in 2020 from a lease termination benefit of $0.7 million in 2019, related primarily to lease terminations in connection with the 2019 Strategic Shift discussed above.
Floor plan interest expense
Floor plan interest expense decreased 50.9%, or $20.4 million, to $19.7 million for 2020 from $40.1 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a 169 basis point decrease in the average floor plan borrowing rate, and a 22.3% decrease in average floor plan borrowings driven by lower average inventory levels.
Other interest expense, net
Other interest expense decreased 21.2%, or $14.7 million, to $54.7 million in 2020 from $69.4 million for 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a 113 basis point decrease in the average interest rate.
Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment
The Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment for 2020 and 2019 was a benefit of $0.1 million and $10.0 million, respectively, which represented an adjustment for lower enacted state income tax rates in both periods.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense increased 95.2%, or $28.2 million, to $57.7 million in 2020 compared to $29.6 million for 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher income generated at CWGS, LLC for which the Company is subject to U.S. federal and state taxes on its allocable share, partially offset by operating losses recorded by Camping World, Inc. (“CW”) for which no tax benefit can be recognized.
Net income (loss)
Net income increased $464.5 million to a net income of $344.2 million in 2020 from a net loss of $120.3 million in 2019 primarily due to the items mentioned above.
Segment results
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total segment income to consolidated income from operations before income taxes for the period presented:
nm - not meaningful
(1) Segment income represents income for each of our reportable segments and is defined as income from operations before depreciation and amortization, plus floor plan interest expense.
(2) Same store revenue definition not applicable to the Good Sam Services and Plans segment.
Good Sam Services and Plans
Good Sam Services and Plans segment revenue was $182.8 million for 2020, an increase of $1.2 million, or 0.7%, from $181.5 million for 2019. The $1.2 million increase was primarily attributable to $2.4 million from increased contracts in force from our roadside assistance programs, $1.8 million from increased contracts in force for our extended vehicle warranty programs, $1.6 million from increased contracts in force for our vehicle insurance products, and $1.1 million from increased RV financing loan volume, partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease from 13 fewer consumer shows, and decreases in advertising revenue, including a $1.5 million decrease from the magazine group and a $1.7 million decrease for the annual directory.
Good Sam Services and Plans segment income was $88.3 million for 2020, an increase of $4.7 million, or 5.6%, from $83.6 million for 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to a gross profit increase of $6.6 million, which was comprised of $4.2 million from increased policies in force and reduced marketing expenses for our extended vehicle warranty programs, $3.2 million from increased policies in force and reduced program expenses in our roadside assistance programs, and $1.2 million from increased loan volume for our RV financing, partially offset by $1.1 million of reduced gross profit from reduced consumer shows, $0.8 million from the annual directory and $0.1 million from other services and plans; and reduced loss on asset disposals of $0.6 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.5 million. Segment income margin net of intersegment revenue elimination increased 220 basis points to 48.8% primarily due to increased policies in force and reduced marketing costs for our extended vehicle warranty programs, and increased policies in force reduced program costs in our roadside assistance programs.
RV and Outdoor Retail segment
RV and Outdoor Retail segment revenue was $5.3 billion for 2020, an increase of $553.8 million, or 11.7%, from $4.7 billion for 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 17.7% increase in new vehicle units sold and a 4.4% increase in average selling price per vehicle, driven by increases in nearly all product types, led by single and double axle travel trailers.
RV and Outdoor Retail segment income was $430.0 million for 2020, an increase of $472.6 million, from segment loss of $42.6 million for 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $408.5 million increase in gross profit primarily from higher towable and motorized gross margins resulting from lower supply from manufacturers and outsized demand from consumers turning to RVing as a vacation alternative and increased strength of the used vehicle market, a $53.9 million reduction in long-lived asset impairment, a $20.4 million decrease in floor plan interest expense, and a $9.5 million reduction in loss on disposal of assets, partially offset by an increase of approximately $14.5 million in selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from commissions on increased revenue partially offset by a reduction resulting from the 2019 Strategic Shift, and a $5.2 million increase in lease termination expense. Segment income margin net of intersegment revenue elimination increased to 8.2% from a segment loss margin of 0.90% in 2019 primarily due to the impact of the 2019 Strategic Shift.
Corporate and other expenses
Corporate and other expenses were $9.8 million for 2020, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 21.7%, from $12.5 million for 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reduced professional fees.
Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment
The Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment for 2020 and 2019 was a benefit of $0.1 million and $10.0 million, respectively, which represented an adjustment for lower enacted state income tax rates in both periods.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Basic, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Diluted, Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Diluted (collectively the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures"). We believe that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics we use in our financial and operational decision making. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by any items adjusted for in these non-GAAP Financial Measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP Financial Measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of those adjusted in this presentation. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we use are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We define “EBITDA” as net income before other interest expense, net (excluding floor plan interest expense), provision for income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of certain noncash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, long-lived asset
impairment, lease termination costs, loss and expense on debt restructure, goodwill impairment, gains and losses on disposal of assets and other expense, net, monitoring fees, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, transaction expenses related to acquisitions, Gander Outdoors pre-opening costs, restructuring costs related to the 2019 Strategic Shift, and other unusual or one-time items. We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the same manner. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these Non GAAP Financial Measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.
The following table reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measures, which are net (loss) income, and net (loss) income margin, respectively:
(a) Represents the loss and expense incurred on debt restructure and financing expense incurred from the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement in 2018, the First and Second Amendment to the Senior Credit Facilities in 2017, the write-off of a portion of the original issue discount, capitalized finance costs from the Previous Term Loan Facilities, and rating agency fees and legal expenses related to the Previous Term Loan Facilities in 2016.
(b) Represents a goodwill impairment charge of $40.0 million related to the RV and Outdoor Retail segment in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(c) Represents long-lived asset impairment charges related to the RV and Outdoor Retail segment, which primarily relate to locations affected by the 2019 Strategic Shift. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(d) Represents the loss (gain) on the termination of operating leases relating primarily to the 2019 Strategic Shift, net of lease termination fees. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(e) Represents an adjustment to eliminate (i) losses on the disposal or sale of real estate at closed retail locations in 2020 and 2019 and (ii) the gains and losses on disposal and sales of various assets.
(f) Represents monitoring fees paid pursuant to a monitoring agreement to Crestview and Stephen Adams. The monitoring agreement was terminated on October 6, 2016 in connection with our IPO.
(g) Represents non-cash equity-based compensation expense relating to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company.
(h) Represents an adjustment to eliminate the gains on remeasurement of the Tax Receivable Agreement primarily due to changes in our effective income tax rate and the transfer of certain assets from GSS Enterprises LLC (“GSS”) to Camping World, Inc. (“CW”).
(i) Represent transaction expenses, primarily legal costs, associated with acquisitions into new or complementary markets, including the Gander Mountain acquisition. This amount excludes transaction expenses related to the acquisition of RV dealerships, consumer shows, and other RV and Outdoor Retail segment business acquisitions which are considered recurring in nature.
(j) Represents pre-opening store costs associated with the Gander Outdoors store openings, which is comprised of 1) Gander Outdoors-specific corporate and retail overhead, 2) distribution center expenses, and 3) store-level startup expenses. As discussed in Note 15 - Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company incurred significant costs related to the initial rollout of Gander Outdoors locations. Based on the nature of the acquisition through a bankruptcy auction and the large quantity of retail locations opened and to be opened in a very compressed timeframe, the Company does not deem the pre-opening store costs for the initial rollout of Gander Outdoors locations to be normal, recurring charges. The Company does not intend to adjust for pre-opening store costs other than for the initial rollout of Gander Outdoors.
(k) Represents restructuring costs relating to our 2019 Strategic Shift. These restructuring costs include one-time employee termination benefits relating to retail store or distribution center closures/divestitures, incremental inventory reserve charges, and other associated costs. These costs exclude lease termination costs, which are presented separately (see (d) above). See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. and Adjusted Earnings Per Share
We define “Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Basic” as net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, long-lived asset impairment, lease termination costs, loss and expense on debt restructure, goodwill impairment, gains and losses on disposal of assets and other expense, net, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, transaction expenses related to acquisitions, Gander Outdoors pre-opening costs, restructuring costs related to the 2019 Strategic Shift, other unusual or one-time items, the income tax expense effect of these adjustments, and the effect of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from these adjustments.
We define “Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Diluted” as Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Basic adjusted for the reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from stock options and restricted stock units, if dilutive, or the assumed exchange, if dilutive, of all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC for shares of newly-issued Class A common stock of Camping World Holdings, Inc.
We define “Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic” as Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Basic divided by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding. We define “Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Diluted” as Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Diluted divided by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming (i) the exchange of all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock of Camping World Holdings, Inc., if dilutive, and (ii) the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units, if any. We present Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Basic, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Diluted, Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Diluted because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these Non GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.
Consistent with the GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Diluted cannot be presented for periods prior to the Company’s IPO on October 6, 2016. Prior to the IPO, the CWGS, LLC membership structure included membership units, preferred units, and profits units. During the period of September 30, 2014 to October 6, 2016, there were 70,000 preferred units outstanding that received a total preferred return of $2.1 million per quarter in addition to their proportionate share of distributions made to all members of CWGS, LLC. The Company analyzed the calculation of earnings per unit for periods prior to the IPO using the two-class method and determined that it resulted in values that would not be meaningful to the users of these consolidated financial statements. Therefore, earnings per share information has not been presented for periods prior to the IPO on October 6, 2016. The Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Diluted for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents only the period of October 6, 2016 to December 31, 2016.
The following table reconciles Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Basic, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. - Diluted, Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Diluted to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc., in the case of the Adjusted Net Income non-GAAP financial measures, and weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - basic, in the case of the Adjusted Earnings Per Share non-GAAP financial measures:
(a) Represents the loss and expense incurred on debt restructure and financing expense incurred from the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement in 2018, the First and Second Amendment to the Senior Credit Facilities in 2017, the write-off of a portion of the
original issue discount, capitalized finance costs from the Previous Term Loan Facilities, and rating agency fees and legal expenses related to the Previous Term Loan Facilities in 2016.
(b) Represents the current and deferred income tax expense or benefit effect of the above adjustments, many of which are related to entities with full valuation allowances for which no tax benefit can be currently recognized. This assumption uses effective tax rates between 25.0% and 25.5% for the adjustments for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and 38.5% for the adjustments in 2017 and 2016, which represents the estimated tax rate that would apply had the above adjustments been included in the determination of our non-GAAP metric.
(c) Represents a goodwill impairment charge of $40.0 million related to the RV and Outdoor Retail segment in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(d) Represents long-lived asset impairment charges related to the RV and Outdoor Retail segment, which primarily relate to locations affected by the 2019 Strategic Shift. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(e) Represents the loss (gain) on the termination of operating leases relating primarily to the 2019 Strategic Shift, net of lease termination costs. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(f) Represents an adjustment to eliminate (i) losses on the disposal or sale of real estate at closed retail locations in 2020 and 2019 and (ii) the gains and losses on disposal and sales of various assets.
(g) Represents non-cash equity-based compensation expense relating to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company.
(h) Represents an adjustment to eliminate the gains on remeasurement of the Tax Receivable Agreement primarily due to changes in our effective income tax rate and the transfer of certain assets from GSS to CW. See Note 11 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(i) Represents transaction expenses, primarily legal costs, associated with acquisitions into new or complementary markets, including the Gander Mountain acquisition. This amount excludes transaction expenses related to the acquisition of RV dealerships, and other RV and Outdoor Retail segment business acquisitions.
(j) Represents pre-opening store costs associated with the Gander Outdoors store openings, which is comprised of 1) Gander Outdoors-specific corporate and retail overhead, 2) distribution center expenses, and 3) store-level startup expenses. The Company incurred significant costs related to the initial rollout of Gander Outdoors locations. Based on the nature of the acquisition through a bankruptcy auction and the large quantity of retail locations opened and to be opened in a very compressed timeframe, the Company does not deem the pre-opening store costs for the initial rollout of Gander Outdoors locations to be normal, recurring charges. The Company does not intend to adjust for pre-opening store costs other than for the initial rollout of Gander Outdoors.
(k) Represents restructuring costs relating to our 2019 Strategic Shift. These restructuring costs include one-time employee termination benefits relating to retail store or distribution center closures/divestitures, incremental inventory reserve charges, and other associated costs. These costs exclude lease termination costs, which are presented separately (see (e) above). See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
(l) This amount relates to the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax assets resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”).
(m) Represents the adjustment to net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests resulting from the above adjustments that impact the net income of CWGS, LLC. This adjustment uses the non-controlling interest’s weighted average ownership of CWGS, LLC of 55.9%, 58.1%, 58.3% and 69.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 77.6% for the post-IPO period of 2016.
(n) Represents the reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from the impact of the assumed change in ownership of CWGS, LLC from stock options, restricted stock units, and/or common units of CWGS, LLC.
(o) Represents the income tax expense effect of the above adjustment for reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests. This assumption uses effective tax rates between 25.0% and 25.5% for the adjustments for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and 38.5% for the adjustments in 2017 and 2016, which represents the estimated tax rate that would apply had the above adjustments been included in the determination of our non-GAAP metric.
(p) Represents the impact to the denominator for stock options, restricted stock units, and/or common units of CWGS, LLC.
(q) The below amounts have not been considered in our adjusted earnings per share - diluted amounts as the effect of these items are anti-dilutive.
(r) Represents adjustments to reflect the income tax benefit of losses of consolidated C-corporations that under the Company’s current equity structure cannot be used against the income of other consolidated subsidiaries of CWGS, LLC. Subsequent to the exchange of all common units in CWGS, LLC, the Company believes certain actions could be taken such that the C-corporations’ losses could offset income of other consolidated subsidiaries. The adjustment reflects the income tax benefit assuming effective tax rates between 25.0% and 25.5% for the adjustments for 2020, 2019 and 2018 for the losses experienced by the consolidated C-corporations for which valuation allowances have been recorded. No assumed release of valuation allowance established for previous periods are included in these amounts. Prior to 2018, the Company did not consider the losses of these C-corporations with valuation allowances to be significant and the Company did not retroactively adjust 2017 or 2016 for these amounts, which were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $2.4 million for the post-IPO period of 2016.
Uses and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management and our board of directors use the Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
● as a measurement of operating performance because they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis, as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations;
● for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections;
● to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; and
● to evaluate our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business.
By providing these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, together with reconciliations, we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. In addition, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities use EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants such as the consolidated leverage ratio. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for net income or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K as indicators of financial performance. Some of the limitations are:
● such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
● such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
● some of such measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;
● some of such measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
● although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
● other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Due to these limitations, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these Non GAAP Financial Measures only supplementally. As noted in the tables above, certain of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures include adjustments for long-lived asset impairment, lease termination costs, loss and expense on debt restructure, goodwill impairment, gains and losses on disposal of assets and other expense, net, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability, transaction expenses related to acquisitions, Gander Outdoors pre-opening costs, restructuring costs relating to the 2019 Strategic Shift, other unusual or one-time items, and the income tax expense effect described above, as applicable. It is reasonable to expect that certain of these items will occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other companies over time. In addition, these certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures adjust for other items that we do not expect to regularly record in periods after the IPO, including monitoring fees. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph and in the reconciliation tables above help management with a
measure of our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day to day operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital have been working capital, inventory management, acquiring and building new retail locations, the improvement and expansion of existing retail locations, debt service, distributions to holders of equity interests in CWGS, LLC and our Class A common stock, and general corporate needs. These cash requirements have historically been met through cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from registered offerings of our Class A common stock, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), borrowings under our Floor Plan Facility (as defined below) and borrowings under our Real Estate Facility (as defined below).
As a public company, our additional liquidity needs include public company costs, payment of regular and special cash dividends, any exercise of the redemption right by the Continuing Equity Owners from time to time (should we elect to exchange common units for a cash payment), our stock repurchase program as described below, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and state and federal taxes to the extent not reduced as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right for as long as their common units remain outstanding. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary, we expect that the payments that we will be required to make to the Continuing Equity Owners, Former Profits Unit Holders, and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. will be significant. Any payments made by us to Continuing Equity Owners, Former Profits Unit Holders, and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to CWGS, LLC and, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For a discussion of the Tax Receivable Agreement, see Note 11 - Income Taxes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
On October 30, 2020, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock, expiring on October 31, 2022. Repurchases under the program are subject to any applicable limitations on the availability of funds to be distributed to the Company by CWGS, LLC to fund repurchase and may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at our discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the Board’s discretion. We expect to fund the repurchases using cash on hand. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 811,223 shares of our Class A common stock for $21.5 million, including broker commissions. As of December 31, 2020, $78.5 million is available under the stock repurchase program to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock.
CWGS, LLC intends to make a regular quarterly cash distribution to its common unit holders, including us, and we intend to use all of the proceeds from such distribution on our common units to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on our Class A common stock, subject to our discretion as the sole managing member of CWGS, LLC and the discretion of our board of directors. During each of the three month periods during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2020, and June 30, 2020, we paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share of our Class A common stock. On July 20, 2020, our board of directors approved the increase of the quarterly dividend to $0.09 per share of Class A common stock from $0.08 per share. Accordingly, during each of the three months ended September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, we paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of our Class A common stock. CWGS, LLC
is required to make cash distributions in accordance with the CWGS LLC Agreement in an amount sufficient for us to pay any expenses incurred by us in connection with the regular quarterly cash dividend, along with any of our other operating expenses and other obligations.
In addition, we currently intend to pay a special cash dividend of all or a portion of the Excess Tax Distribution (as defined under “Dividend Policy” included in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K) to the holders of our Class A common stock from time to time subject to the discretion of our board of directors as described under “Dividend Policy” included in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K. During each of the three month periods during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, we paid a special cash dividend of $0.0732 per share of our Class A common stock. Additionally, on July 20, 2020, our board of directors increased the quarterly special cash dividend to $0.08 per share of Class A common stock from $0.0732 per share. Accordingly, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, we paid a special dividend of $0.08 per share of our Class A common stock. Moreover, on September 17, 2020, our board of directors increased the quarterly special cash dividend to $0.14 per share of Class A common stock from $0.08 per share beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, on November 18, 2020, our board of directors approved a $0.77 per share of Class A common stock one-time special cash dividend. These special dividends are typically funded by the accumulated tax distributions received by CWH from CWGS, LLC that are in excess of the corporate income taxes payable by CWH and current payment obligations under the TRA liability. In December 2020, CWGS, LLC paid an additional $0.20 per common unit distribution to partially fund the $0.77 per share of Class A common stock one-time special cash dividend discussed above. Our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations particularly with respect to liquidity, and we may not pay future dividends according to our policy, or at all. See “Dividend Policy” included in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K and “Risk Factors ─ Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock ─ “Our ability to pay regular and special dividends on our Class A common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our structure and statutory restrictions” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
We have currently identified over 20 markets that would be attractive for both acquisition and greenfield opportunities in 2021. This expansion could require in excess of $150.0 million for a combination of business acquisitions and capital expenditures relating to land, buildings, and improvements. Factors that could impact the quantity of locations or the cost to acquire or open those locations include, but are not limited to, our ability to locate potential acquisition targets or greenfield locations in a geographic area and at a cost that meet our success criteria; continued strong cash flow generation from our operations to fund these acquisitions and new locations; and availability of financing on our Floor Plan Facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred long-lived asset impairment charges of $12.4 million, including $12.3 million primarily in connection with the 2019 Strategic Shift. We expect that none of the foregoing charges will result in future cash expenditures. Additionally, in connection with the 2019 Strategic Shift, we have incurred or expect to incur costs relating to one-time employee termination benefits as outlined in Note 5 ─ Restructuring and Long-Lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
There is significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and cash flows. As a result, we initially took proactive steps to increase cash available on-hand, including, but not limited to, reducing cash expenditures, including wage reductions through a combination of temporary salary reductions, layoffs, and furloughs; negotiating payment deferrals with lessors, reducing marketing and promotional expenses; and delaying strategic capital expenditures. We had negotiated lease payment deferrals with numerous landlords amounting to approximately $14.0 million from 2020 into 2021. As demand for our products accelerated and our cash position improved, we repaid these deferred lease payment amounts in full prior to June 30, 2020 and most of the temporary salary reductions ended in May 2020. Additionally, as a result of our improved cash position, we made voluntary principal payments in June 2020 of $9.6 million on our Term Loan Facility and $20.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. We are continually monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impacts on our business. If stay-at-home and shelter-in-place restrictions are put back into place, we may choose to re-implement cost reduction measures.
We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital including cash provided by operating activities, additional borrowings under our Floor Plan Facility, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be
sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, including the opening of any additional retail locations, regular and special quarterly cash dividends (as described above), required payments for our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents or cash available under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Floor Plan Facility, including the potential additional borrowings noted above, will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and if availability under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Floor Plan Facility is not sufficient, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may impose significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all, including the expected additional borrowings noted above and particularly in light of the economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business - Our ability to operate and expand our business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $458.7 million, including $166.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our working capital reflects the cash provided by deferred revenue reported under current liabilities of $88.2 million as of December 31, 2020, which reduces working capital. Deferred revenue primarily consists of cash collected for club memberships in advance of services to be provided, which is deferred and recognized as revenue over the life of the membership, and deferred revenue for the annual guide. We use net proceeds from this deferred membership revenue to lower our long-term borrowings and finance our working capital needs. Our Floor Plan Facility includes a flooring line aggregate interest reduction (“FLAIR”) offset account that allows us to transfer cash as an offset to the payable under the Floor Plan Facility. The FLAIR offset account at December 31, 2020 was $133.6 million, $124.4 million of which could have been withdrawn while remaining in compliance with the financial covenants of the Floor Plan Facility.
Seasonality
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in revenue, net income, and cash flows as a result of annual seasonality in our business. Because RVs are used primarily by vacationers and campers, demand for services, protection plans, products, and resources generally declines during the winter season, while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months. In addition, unusually severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may impact demand.
We generate a disproportionately higher amount of our annual revenue in our second and third fiscal quarters, respectively, which include the spring and summer months. We incur additional expenses in the second and third fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes, increased staffing in our retail locations and program costs. If, for any reason, we miscalculate the demand for our products or our product mix during the second and third fiscal quarters, our sales in these quarters could decline, resulting in higher labor costs as a percentage of sales, lower margins and excess inventory, which could cause our annual results of operations to suffer and our stock price to decline.
Additionally, SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of acquisitions and the seasonality of our business. We prefer to acquire new retail locations in the first and fourth quarters of each year in order to provide time for the location to be re-modeled and to ramp up operations ahead of the spring and summer months. The timing of our acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters, coupled with generally lower revenue in these quarters has historically resulted in SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit being higher in these quarters.
Due to our seasonality, the possible adverse impact from other risks associated with our business, including atypical weather, consumer spending levels and general business conditions, is potentially greater if any such risks occur during our peak sales seasons. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business - Our business is seasonal and this leads to fluctuations in sales and revenues” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Cash Flow
The following table shows summary cash flows information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively:
Operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily collections from contracts in transit and customers following the sale of new and used vehicles, as well as from the sale of retail parts, service and other. Contracts in transit represent amounts due from third-party lenders from whom pre-arranged agreements have been determined, and to whom the retail installment sales contracts have been assigned. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floor plan payables, payments to retail product suppliers, personnel-related expenditures, payments related to leased property, advertising, and various consumer services program costs.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $747.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $495.7 million from $251.9 million of net cash provided in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $464.5 million increase in net income, $55.2 million of increased accounts payable and other accrued expenses, a $29.2 million accrual for FICA deferral related to The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), and $0.7 million of other increases, partially offset by a $53.9 million reduction in long-lived asset impairment.
Investing activities. Our investment in business activities primarily consists of expanding our operations through organic growth and the acquisition of retail locations. Substantially all of our new retail location acquisitions and capital expenditures have been financed using cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as applicable.
Our capital expenditures consist primarily of investing in acquired and greenfield retail and RV dealership locations, existing retail locations, information technology, hardware and software. There were no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, during 2020, we entered into the non-cash activity for new finance leases for $6.5 million for IT hardware and $25.4 million for real estate. The table below summarizes our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively:
Net cash used in investing activities was $125.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $125.9 million of cash used in investing activities was comprised of $53.1 million for the purchase of real property, $47.6 million for the purchase of RV and Outdoor Retail businesses, $31.8 million of capital expenditures primarily related to retail locations, $2.5 million for investment in businesses, and $0.2 million for the purchase of intangible assets, partially offset by $7.5 million from the sale of real property, and proceeds of $1.8 million from the sale of property and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $104.5 million for year ended December 31, 2019. The $104.5 million of cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $56.8 million, acquisition of retail locations of $48.4 million, and purchases of real property of $31.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and leaseback of real property and the sale of property and equipment of $28.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively.
Financing activities. Our financing activities primarily consist of proceeds from the issuance of debt and the repayment of principal and debt issuance costs.
Our net cash used in financing activities was $603.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $603.2 million of cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $324.5 million of payments under the Floor Plan Facility, $137.0 million of distributions to CWGS, LLC common unit holders, $61.0 million of dividends paid on Class A common stock, $39.1 million of payments on long-term debt, $21.5 million for repurchases of Class A common stock to treasury stock, $20.0 million of payments on credit facilities, and $4.7 million of payments related to RSU shares withheld for taxes, partially offset by proceeds from exercise of stock options of $4.6 million.
Our net cash used in financing activities was $138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $138.4 million of cash used in financing activities was primarily due to distributions to CWGS, LLC common unit holders of $70.2 million, net payments under the Floor Plan Facility of $44.0 million, dividends paid on Class A common stock of $22.9 million, and net payment of debt of $13.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt of $11.7 million, and other financing sources of $0.7 million.
