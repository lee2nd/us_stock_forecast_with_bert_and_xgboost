MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing therapeutic monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that address diseases for which available treatments are inadequate. Our drug candidates include antibody-based therapeutics which have the ability to engage the human immune system and/or directly affect critical pathways to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory diseases and many forms of cancer.
We are focusing our efforts and resources on the continued research and development of:
•
CDX-0159, a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the KIT receptor and potently inhibits its activity, which completed a Phase 1a study in healthy subjects in summer 2020. We are studying CDX-0159 in mast cell driven diseases, including, initially, in urticarias and plan to initiate a study in prurigo nodularis in the fourth quarter of 2021. In October and December 2020 respectively, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patients had been dosed in Phase 1b studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU). Positive interim data to date from the Phase 1b study in CIndU were reported in late Q1 2021 in patients with cold contact urticaria and symptomatic dermographism and we announced that we would be expanding this study to also include patients with cholinergic urticaria;
•
CDX-1140, an agonist monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response, currently being studied in a Phase1 study. Dose escalation was completed in a Phase 1 study in solid tumors and lymphoma and the recommended dose for further study was determined to be 1.5 mg/kg for both CDX-1140 monotherapy and in combination with CDX-301, our dendritic cell growth factor. We have initiated multiple expansion cohorts within the study, including a combination cohort with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients refractory to PD1/PDL1 treatment and a combination cohort with standard of care chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. We are exploring additional combination cohorts with mechanisms that we believe could be complementary or synergistic with CDX-1140; and
•
CDX-527, a bispecific antibody that uses our proprietary highly active anti-PD-L1 and CD27 human antibodies to couple CD27 co-stimulation with blockade of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, for which we initiated a Phase 1 study in advanced solid tumors in August 2020.
We routinely work with external parties to collaboratively advance our drug candidates. In addition to Celldex-led studies, we also have an Investigator Initiated Research (IIR) program with multiple studies ongoing with our drug candidates.
Our goal is to build a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. We believe our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product. Currently, all programs are fully owned by Celldex.
The expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a drug candidate. It is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of drug candidates to each take five years or more, and for total development costs to exceed $100 million for each drug candidate. We estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines:
The duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol, including, among others, the following:
•
the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial;
•
the duration of patient follow-up that seems appropriate in view of results;
•
the number of clinical sites included in the trials;
•
the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects; and
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate.
We test potential drug candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and immunogenicity. We may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each drug candidate. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates.
An element of our business strategy is to pursue the discovery, research and development of a broad portfolio of drug candidates. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of drug candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates increases.
Regulatory approval is required before we can market our drug candidates as therapeutic products. In order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval, the regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials (through Phase 2) have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.
Furthermore, our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our drug candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. Our programs may also benefit from subsidies, grants, contracts or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs.
As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, among others, it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.
During the past five years through December 31, 2020, we incurred an aggregate of $350.6 million in research and development expenses. The following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs, license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program.
Clinical Development Programs
While our clinical development programs have not been significantly, negatively impacted by COVID-19 to date, we continue to carefully monitor the evolving situation closely across all our development programs and work to minimize potential impact/disruptions.
CDX-0159
CDX-0159 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and potently inhibits its activity. KIT is expressed in a variety of cells, including mast cells, and its activation by its ligand SCF regulates mast cell growth, differentiation, survival, chemotaxis and degranulation. In certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease.
CDX-0159 is designed to block KIT activation by disrupting both SCF binding and KIT dimerization. Celldex believes that by targeting KIT, CDX-0159 may be able to inhibit mast cell activity and decrease mast cell numbers to provide potential clinical benefit in mast cell related diseases.
In June 2020, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose escalation Phase 1a study of CDX-0159 in healthy subjects (n=32; 8 subjects per cohort, 6 CDX-0159; 2 placebo). Subjects received a single intravenous infusion of CDX-0159 at 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 9.0 mg/kg or placebo. The objectives of the study included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (tryptase and stem cell factor) and immunogenicity. Tryptase is an enzyme synthesized and secreted almost exclusively by mast cells and decreases in plasma tryptase levels are believed to reflect a systemic reduction in mast cell burden in both healthy volunteers and in disease. Data from the study were featured in a late breaking presentation at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress 2020 in June. CDX-0159 demonstrated a favorable safety profile as well as profound and durable reductions of plasma tryptase, consistent with systemic mast cell suppression.
•
Most common adverse events were mild infusion-related reactions, all of which spontaneously resolved without intervention. Mild and asymptomatic decreases in neutrophil and white blood cell count were observed in laboratory testing.
•
A single dose of CDX-0159 suppressed plasma tryptase levels in a dose-dependent manner, indicative of systemic mast cell suppression. Tryptase suppression below the level of detection was observed after a single 1.0 mg/kg dose and was maintained for more than 2 months at single doses of both 3.0 and 9.0 mg/kg of CDX-0159. A subset of subjects from the 3mg/kg and 9 mg/kg cohorts agreed to continued follow up for tryptase suppression which remained below the level of detection for over 3 months (14 weeks) in 50% of subjects and over 4 months (18 weeks) in all subjects, respectively.
•
Dose dependent increases in plasma stem cell factor mirror decreases in tryptase, consistent with allosteric blockade of stem cell factor to KIT and demonstrate complete target engagement in vivo.
•
Long serum half-life and non-immunogenic profile support a convenient dosing schedule.
•
Enhanced PK profile and durable tryptase suppression at low doses support re-formulation for sub-cutaneous administration.
These data supported expansion of the CDX-0159 program into mast cell driven diseases, including initially in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), diseases where mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. The prevalence of CSU and CIndU is approximately 0.5-1% of the total population or up to 1 to 3 million patients in the United States alone (Weller et al. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet. Org). CSU presents as itchy hives, angioedema or both for at least six weeks without a specific trigger; multiple episodes can play out over years or even decades. About 50% of patients with CSU achieve symptomatic control with antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists. Omalizumab, an IgE inhibitor, provides relief for roughly half of the remaining antihistamine/leukotriene refractory patients. Consequently, there is a need for additional therapies. CIndUs are forms of urticaria that have an attributable cause or trigger associated with them, typically resulting in hives or wheals. Celldex is exploring cold-induced and dermographism (scratch-induced) urticarias.
In October 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b multi-center study of CDX-0159 in CSU. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety of multiple ascending doses of CDX-0159 in up to 40 patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with antihistamines. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels and clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response) as well as quality of life assessments. CDX-0159 is administered intravenously (0.5, 1.5, 3 and 4.5 mg/kg at varying dosing schedules) as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines, either alone or in combination with H2-antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor agonists.
In December 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a second Phase 1b study in CIndU being conducted in Germany. This study is an open label clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety of a single dose of CDX-0159 in up to 20 patients with cold contact urticaria (n=10) or symptomatic dermographism (n=10) who are refractory to antihistamines. Patient’s symptoms are induced via provocation testing that resembles real life triggering situations. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including changes from baseline provocation thresholds, measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels, clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response), quality of life assessments and measurement of tissue mast cells through skin biopsies. CDX-0159 is administered intravenously (3.0 mg/kg) on Day 1 as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines.
In March of 2021, we reported positive interim data from the Phase 1b study in CIndU in patients with cold contact urticaria and symptomatic dermographism. Fifteen out of 20 planned patients with antihistamine refractory CIndU had received a single intravenous infusion of CDX-0159 at 3 mg/kg, including nine patients with cold contact urticaria (ColdU) and six patients with symptomatic dermographism (SD). Safety results were reported for all 15 patients; activity results were reported for all patients assessed for at least 15 days/2 weeks after treatment (n=10; 7 ColdU and 3 SD). Patients had high disease activity as assessed by provocation threshold testing. In ColdU and SD pts, baseline critical temperature thresholds were 18.7 +/- 2.7 °C (range: 5-27°C) and FricTest® thresholds were 3.7 +/- 0.3 (range: 3-4) of 4.
•
Eight of 10 patients (7 ColdU; 1 SD) experienced a complete response (CR) as assessed by provocation threshold testing. The remaining two patients (both with SD), had been recently treated and were followed for two weeks. One patient experienced a partial response (PR) thus far and one patient reported symptomatic improvement (decreased itching). All patients will continue to be assessed for response through week 12.
•
Patient global assessment (Pat-GA) and physician global assessment (Phy-GA) results were consistent with provocation testing results.
•
Measurements of serum tryptase levels are available for only the first six patients evaluated for activity, all with ColdU. The mean baseline was 3.3 +/- 0.2 ng/ml and levels on day 15 after treatment were at or below the limit of detection. These patients all experienced complete responses.
•
CDX-0159 was generally well tolerated. Six of 15 patients had mild infusion reactions, generally areas of localized redness and itching, which resolved rapidly. A single severe infusion reaction was observed (brief loss of consciousness, followed by shaking and sweating). The patient was treated with
antihistamines and steroids; no epinephrine was administered. The patient rapidly recovered and was hospitalized for observation with no further manifestations of this event. Importantly, there was no evidence of mast cell activation as measured by decreases in serum tryptase levels shortly after the infusion and further at a later time point.
•
Through day 15, three patients had transient, mild decreases in hemoglobin, and no patients had meaningful declines in white blood cells.
•
Enrollment is currently being completed in the ColdU and SD cohorts (10 per cohort; 20 total). Based on these compelling results, the study is being expanded to also include 10 patients with cholinergic urticaria and is planned to begin enrolling these patients in May of 2021.
We continue to assess potential opportunities for CDX-0159 in other diseases where mast cells play an important role, such as dermatologic, respiratory, allergic, gastrointestinal and ophthalmic conditions. In February of 2021, we announced that we plan to expand clinical development of CDX-0159 into prurigo nodularis (PN), a chronic skin disease characterized by the development of hard, intensely itchy (pruritic) nodules on the skin. Mast cells through their interactions with sensory neurons and other immune cells are believed to play an important role in amplifying chronic itch and neuroinflammation, both of which are a hallmark of PN. There are currently no FDA approved therapies for PN, representing an area of significant unmet need. Celldex anticipates initiating the study in PN in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Manufacturing activities are also progressing as planned to support the introduction of the CDX-0159 subcutaneous formulation into the clinical program in the third quarter of 2021.
CDX-1140
CDX-1140 is a fully human agonist monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response, which is found on dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells and is also expressed on many cancer cells. Potent CD40 agonist antibodies have shown encouraging results in early clinical studies; however, systemic toxicity associated with broad CD40 activation has limited their dosing. CDX-1140 has unique properties relative to other CD40 agonist antibodies: potent agonist activity is independent of Fc receptor interaction, contributing to more consistent, controlled immune activation; CD40L binding is not blocked, leading to potential synergistic effects of agonist activity near activated T cells in lymph nodes and tumors; and the antibody does not promote cytokine production in whole blood assays. CDX-1140 has shown direct anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of lymphoma. Preclinical studies of CDX-1140 clearly demonstrate strong immune activation effects and low systemic toxicity and support the design of the Phase 1 study to identify the dose for characterizing single-agent and combination activity.
We initiated a Phase 1 study of CDX-1140 in November 2017. This study is expected to enroll up to approximately 260 patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and B cell lymphomas. The study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, during a dose-escalation phase (0.01 to 3.0 mg/kg once every four weeks until confirmed progression or intolerance) and to recommend a dose level for further study in a subsequent expansion phase. The expansion is designed to further evaluate the tolerability and biologic effects of selected dose(s) of CDX-1140 in specific tumor types. Secondary objectives include assessments of safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and additional measures of anti-tumor activity, including clinical benefit rate. We believe that the potential for CDX-1140 will be best defined in combination studies with other immunotherapies or conventional cancer treatments.
In support of this, the Phase 1 study protocol also allows for the exploration of CDX-1140 in combination with CDX-301 at a fixed dose of CDX-301 and escalating doses of CDX-1140. Dendritic cells, which express CD40, are often rare or missing from the tumor microenvironment and are critical for initiating anti-tumor immunity. CDX-301, a recombinant FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, or Flt3L, is a hematopoietic cytokine that uniquely expands dendritic cells and hematopoietic stem cells, and in combination with other agents may potentiate anti-tumor responses. CDX-301 is being utilized as a priming agent in this study to increase the number of dendritic cells in blood and tissue available for CDX-1140 activation. CDX-1140 should, in turn, activate and mature the dendritic cells, an important step for enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.
Prior data presented at Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 34th Annual Meeting in November 2019. established the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for continued study at 1.5 mg/kg - one of the highest systemic dose levels in the CD40 agonist class. Clinical activity both as a monotherapy and in combination with CDX-301 were also reported for CDX-1140 at varying doses, including an unconfirmed partial response (uPR) and tumor cavitation. At SITC 2020, analysis was focused on patients treated at the MTD and recommended dose of 1.5 mg/kg. 41 patients (n=25 monotherapy; n=16 in combination with CDX-301) had been treated at the 1.5 mg/kg dose at the time of data cutoff; 29 patients had post-treatment scans performed and five patients had not reached their first post-treatment response assessment. In addition, preliminary safety data from the combination cohort with pembrolizumab (n=9; 4 at 0.72 mg/kg and 5 at 1.5 mg/kg CDX-1140) were also presented. CDX-1140 monotherapy and in combination with CDX-301 or pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated with mostly grade 1 or grade 2 drug related adverse events. Activity at 1.5mg/kg dose of CDX-1140 to date included:
•
An ongoing (6+ months) complete response (CR) in a patient with follicular lymphoma treated with CDX-1140 in combination with CDX-301;
•
Notable tumor shrinkage and/or necrosis in 6 patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer (SCCHN), including extensive tumor cavitation/necrosis of a large baseline protruding neck mass associated with decreased tumor pain in a patient; and,
•
Stable disease (n=10) for 11 to 32 weeks.
CDX-1140 at the recommended dose of 1.5 mg/kg provided good systemic exposure that enhanced the distribution into tissues and tumor and resulted in marked changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) consistent with a more inflammatory and less immunosuppressive state as demonstrated by gene expression analysis. Interferon signaling and cytotoxicity pathways were most highly upregulated, while immunosuppression via TGFb signaling and metastatic pathways were downregulated, marking the first clear demonstration in patients of biological activity within the TME for a systemically administered agonist anti-CD40 mAb. Pre-treatment of patients with CDX-301 greatly increased the number of circulating dendritic cells prior to CDX-1140 administration and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CDX-301 pretreated patients were more responsive to CDX-1140 than PBMCs from non-pretreated patients.
Two combination cohorts are ongoing. A combination of CDX-1140 with pembrolizumab has completed the safety run-in and expansion cohorts in patients with checkpoint-refractory squamous cell head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer is enrolling patients. A combination of CDX-1140 with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is also enrolling patients. We are also exploring additional combination cohorts with mechanisms that we believe could be complementary or synergistic with CDX-1140.
CDX-527
CDX-527 is the first candidate from Celldex’s bispecific antibody platform. Bispecifics provide opportunities to engage two independent pathways involved in controlling immune responses to tumors. CDX-527 uses Celldex’s proprietary highly active anti-PD-L1 and CD27 human antibodies to couple CD27 co-stimulation with blockade of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway to help prime and activate anti-tumor T cell responses through CD27 costimulation, while preventing PD-1 inhibitory signals that subvert the immune response.
Celldex’s prior clinical experience with combining CD27 activation and PD-1 blockade provide the rationale for linking these two pathways into one molecule. Preclinical data presented at the SITC 34th Annual Meeting in November 2019 demonstrated that CDX-527 is more potent at T cell activation and anti-tumor immunity than the combination of parental monoclonal antibodies.
In August 2020, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in up to ~90 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have progressed during or after standard of care therapy to be followed by tumor-specific expansion cohorts. The study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, during a dose-escalation phase and to recommend a dose level for further study in the
subsequent expansion phase. The expansion is designed to further evaluate the tolerability, and biologic and anti-tumor effects of selected dose level(s) of CDX-527 in specific tumor types. Enrollment is ongoing.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe our most critical accounting policies include accounting for contingent consideration, revenue recognition, intangible and long-lived assets, research and development expenses and stock-based compensation expense.
The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements:
Contingent Consideration
We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:
•
timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;
•
timing and probability of success of meeting clinical and commercial milestones; and
•
discount rates.
Our contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with our acquisition of Kolltan. On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.
The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration adjustment recorded in any given period.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when performance obligations under agreements or contracts are satisfied, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Revenue for the Company has historically been derived from biopharmaceutical product development agreements with collaborative partners for the research and development of therapeutic drug candidates. The terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable signing and licensing fees, funding for research,
development and manufacturing, milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations. The Company assesses the multiple obligations typically within product development contracts to determine the distinct performance obligations and how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each distinct performance obligation.
Under product development agreements, revenue is generally recognized using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. Revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimation of cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables, such as expected clinical trial costs, and requires significant judgements. Circumstances can arise that change original estimates of costs or progress toward completion. Any revisions to estimates are reflected in revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the change in circumstances became known.
Revenue for the Company is also derived from manufacturing and research and development arrangements. The Company owns and operates a cGMP manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, to produce drug substance for its current and planned early-stage clinical trials. In order to utilize excess capacity, the Company has, from time to time, entered into contract manufacturing and research and development arrangements in which services are provided on a time-and-material basis or at a negotiated fixed-price. Revenue from time-and-material contracts is generally recognized on an output basis as labor hours and/or direct expenses are incurred. Under fixed-price contracts, revenue is generally recognized on an output basis as progress is made toward completion of the performance obligations using surveys of performance completed to date.
Intangible and Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, and finite-lived intangible assets when circumstances indicate that an event of impairment may have occurred. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their estimated fair values.
IPR&D assets acquired in a business combination initially are recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assets are capitalized on our balance sheets until either the project underlying them is completed or the assets become impaired. If a project is completed, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized over the remaining estimated life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed. If a project becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is taken in the period in which the impairment occurs. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these tests, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:
•
timing and costs to complete the in-process projects;
•
timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;
•
estimated future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and
•
discount rates
Each IPR&D asset is assessed for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we evaluated the TAM program IPR&D asset for potential impairment as a result of changes in projected development and regulatory timelines related to the program. We concluded that the TAM IPR&D asset was partially impaired, and a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of the discontinuation of the CDX-3379 program in the second quarter of 2020, we concluded that the CDX-3379 IPR&D asset was fully impaired, and a non-cash impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2020. We performed an annual impairment test of the remaining IPR&D assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 and concluded that the IPR&D assets were not impaired.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination with a finite life are recorded at fair value and amortized over the greater of economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs, including internal and contract research costs, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist mainly of clinical trial costs, manufacturing of clinical material, toxicology and other preclinical studies, personnel costs, depreciation, license fees and funding of outside contracted research.
Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organization, or CRO, services. Contract manufacturing expenses include expenses associated with contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, services. The invoicing from CROs and CMOs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO and CMO activities based on our estimate of costs incurred. We maintain regular communication with our CROs and CMOs to assess the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual expenses and estimated expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We record stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees, directors and non-employees based on the estimated fair values of the stock-based awards expected to vest at the grant date and adjust, if necessary, to reflect actual forfeitures. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to estimate the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term based on historical exercise patterns. For non-employee grants, we may elect to use the contractual term as the expected term in the option-pricing model. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized using the straight-line method over the term of vesting or performance.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net Loss
The $8.9 million increase in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of an increase in non-cash intangible asset impairment expense, partially offset by an increase in revenue and an increase in the gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration.
Revenue
The Company’s agreement with Rockefeller University, as amended, (the “Rockefeller Agreement”) provides for the Company to perform manufacturing and development services for Rockefeller University for their portfolio of antibodies against HIV. This portfolio was licensed to Gilead Sciences in January 2020 from Rockefeller University (“Rockefeller Transaction”). The $1.8 million increase in product development and licensing agreements revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the $1.8 million received from the Rockefeller Transaction. The $2.0 million increase in contracts and grants revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily related to an increase in services performed under our contract manufacturing and research and development agreements with Rockefeller University and Gilead Sciences, partially offset by a decrease in services performed under our manufacturing and research and development agreement with Duke University. We expect revenue to decrease over the next twelve months as a result of a decrease in revenue from product development and licensing agreements.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expenses consist primarily of (i) personnel expenses, (ii) laboratory supply expenses relating to the development of our technology, (iii) facility expenses and (iv) product development expenses associated with our drug candidates as follows:
Personnel expenses primarily include salary, benefits, stock-based compensation and payroll taxes. The $0.4 million increase in personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in bonus expense. We expect personnel expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.
Laboratory supplies expenses include laboratory materials and supplies, services, and other related expenses incurred in the development of our technology. The $0.1 million increase in laboratory supply expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to higher laboratory materials and supplies purchases. We expect laboratory supplies expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.
Facility expenses include depreciation, amortization, utilities, rent, maintenance and other related expenses incurred at our facilities. The $0.4 million decrease in facility expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to lower rent and depreciation expense. We expect facility expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.
Product development expenses include clinical investigator site fees, external trial monitoring costs, data accumulation costs, contracted research and outside clinical drug product manufacturing. The $0.1 million increase in product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial and contract manufacturing expenses of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in contract research expenses of $1.0 million. We expect product development expenses to increase over the next twelve months as a result of higher clinical trial, contract research, and contract manufacturing expenses.
General and Administrative Expense
The $1.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due lower stock-based compensation expense and lower facility expenses as a result of the consolidation our Massachusetts lab and manufacturing facilities in the second quarter of 2020. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.
Intangible Asset Impairment
We evaluated the TAM program IPR&D asset for potential impairment as a result of changes in projected development and regulatory timelines related to the program in the fourth quarter of 2020. We concluded that the TAM program IPR&D asset was partially impaired, and a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. We evaluated the CDX-3379 IPR&D asset for potential impairment as a result of the discontinuation of the CDX-3379 program in the second quarter of 2020. We concluded that the CDX-3379 IPR&D asset was fully impaired, and a non-cash impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
Other Asset Impairment
We concluded that the Company’s investment in an undisclosed private company was impaired as a result of a deterioration in the private company’s financial condition and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.8 million during the first quarter of 2019.
Gain on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration
The $4.2 million gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to updated assumptions for CDX-3379 related milestones due to the discontinuation of the CDX-3379 program partially offset by changes in discount rates and the passage of time.
Investment and Other Income, Net
The $1.7 million decrease in investment and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to lower interest rates on fixed income investments and lower other income related to our sale of New Jersey tax benefits. We expect investment income to decrease over the next twelve months due to lower other income related to our sale of New Jersey tax benefits.
Income Tax Benefit
A $1.2 million non-cash income tax benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the partial impairment of the TAM program IPR&D asset in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the full impairment of the CDX-3379 IPR&D asset in the second quarter of 2020.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net Loss
The $100.3 million decrease in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of a decrease in non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment expense and a decrease in research and development expenses, partially offset by the decrease in gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration.
Revenue
The $2.9 million decrease in product development and licensing agreements revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our BMS agreement as a result of the completion of our combination clinical study. The $3.1 million decrease in contracts and grants revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily related to a decrease in services performed under our contract manufacturing and research and development agreements with Rockefeller University and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expenses consist primarily of (i) personnel expenses, (ii) laboratory supply expenses relating to the development of our technology, (iii) facility expenses and (iv) product development expenses associated with our drug candidates as follows:
Personnel expenses primarily include salary, benefits, stock-based compensation and payroll taxes. The $6.6 million decrease in personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in headcount, lower stock-based compensation expense and lower severance expense related to the workforce reduction that occurred in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of the discontinuation of the Glemba program.
Laboratory supplies expenses include laboratory materials and supplies, services, and other related expenses incurred in the development of our technology. The $0.1 million increase in laboratory supply expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to higher laboratory materials and supplies purchases.
Facility expenses include depreciation, amortization, utilities, rent, maintenance and other related expenses incurred at our facilities. The $0.7 million decrease in facility expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to lower depreciation expense.
Product development expenses include clinical investigator site fees, external trial monitoring costs, data accumulation costs, contracted research and outside clinical drug product manufacturing. The $12.4 million decrease in product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in clinical trial expenses of $8.1 million and a decrease in contract manufacturing expenses of $3.6 million.
General and Administrative Expense
The $3.8 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, lower commercial planning costs and lower lease restructuring expense.
Goodwill Impairment
We recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $91.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the discontinuation of the Glemba program.
Intangible Asset Impairment
We recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $18.7 million on the Glemba program intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the discontinuation of the Glemba program. Due to the nature of IPR&D projects, the Company may experience future delays or failures to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, failures of such clinical trials or other failures to achieve a commercially viable product, and as a result, may recognize further impairment losses in the future.
Other Asset Impairment
We concluded that the Company’s investment in an undisclosed private company was impaired as a result of a deterioration in the private company’s financial condition and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.8 million during the first quarter of 2019.
Gain on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration
The $1.3 million gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to changes in discount rates, the passage of time and updated assumptions for the varlilumab program.
Amortization Expense
The $0.2 million decrease in amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was due to the full impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization recorded in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the discontinuation of the Glemba program.
Investment and Other Income, Net
The $0.3 million decrease in investment and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to lower levels of cash and investment balances.
Income Tax Benefit
We recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of $0.8 million related to the impairment of the Glemba IPR&D assets during the year ended December 31, 2018.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist primarily of investments in money market mutual funds with commercial banks and financial institutions. We maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. We invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities, including municipal bond securities, U.S. government agency securities and high-grade corporate bonds that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity.
The use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees; facility and facility-related costs for our offices, laboratories and manufacturing facility; fees paid in connection with preclinical studies, clinical studies, contract manufacturing, laboratory supplies and services; and consulting, legal and other professional fees. To date, the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from our collaborative partners and from government entities and payments received for contract manufacturing and research and development services provided by us. The timing of any new contract manufacturing and research and development agreements, collaboration agreements, government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements, contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
At December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $194.4 million. We have had recurring losses and incurred a loss of $59.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40.4 million. We believe that the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2020 are sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations through 2023. This could be impacted if we elected to pay Kolltan contingent milestones, if any, in cash.
During the next twelve months, we may take further steps to raise additional capital to meet our long-term liquidity needs including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: the licensing of drug candidates with existing or new collaborative partners, possible business combinations, issuance of debt, or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings. Although we have been successful in raising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used. There is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders; debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development. Our ability to continue funding our planned operations into and beyond twelve months from the issuance date is also dependent on the timing and manner of payment of future contingent milestones from the Kolltan acquisition, in the event that we achieve the drug candidate milestones related to those payments. We may decide to pay those milestone payments in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof. If we are unable to raise the funds necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we may have to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs, discontinue or delay ongoing or anticipated clinical trials, license out programs earlier than expected, raise funds at a significant discount or on other unfavorable terms, if at all, or sell all or a part of our business.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in revenue and decreases in both general and administrative and research and development expenses. We expect that cash used in operating activities will remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis.
Net cash used in operating activities was $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to decreases in both general and administrative and research and development expenses.
We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development, including preclinical and clinical trials and clinical drug product manufacturing as our drug candidates are developed. We plan to spend significant amounts to progress our current drug candidates through the clinical trial processes as well as to develop additional drug candidates. As our drug candidates progress through the clinical trial process, we may be obligated to make significant milestone payments.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $96.7 million as compared to net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect that cash provided by investing activities will increase over the next twelve months as we fund our operations through the combination of net proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities, cash provided by financing activities and/or new partnerships, although there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis based on the amount of cash provided by financing activities and/or new partnerships.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net cash provided by
investing activities was primarily due to net sales and maturities of marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $17.8 million as compared to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $171.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net proceeds from stock issuances, including stock issued pursuant to employee benefit plans, were $171.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net proceeds from stock issuances, including stock issued pursuant to employee benefit plans, were $16.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Equity Offerings
In November 2020, the Company filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register for sale any combination of the types of securities described in the shelf registration statement.
In May 2016, we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”) to allow us to issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through Cantor, acting as agent. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued 7.1 million, 5.0 million and 2.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, under the agreement with Cantor resulting in net proceeds of $29.4 million, $16.2 million and $29.0 million, respectively, after deducting commission and offering expenses. At December 31, 2020, we had $50.0 million remaining in aggregate gross offering price available under our November 2020 prospectus supplement.
In June 2020, the Company issued 15,384,614 shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $141.4 million, after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses.
AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
We have entered into license agreements whereby we have received licenses or options to license technology, specified patents and/or patent applications. These license and collaboration agreements generally provide for royalty payments equal to specified percentages of product sales, annual license maintenance fees, continuing patent prosecution costs and potential future milestone payments to third parties upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2020 such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. We expect to incur approximately $0.1 million of license and milestone payments in 2021.
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations (not including contingent royalty and milestone payments as described above) at December 31, 2020 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future years. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:
(1)
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract research organizations for clinical trials, contract manufacturing organizations, vendors for preclinical research studies and other
services and products for operating purposes. We have included obligations in the table above if the contracts are not cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice to the vendor.
(2)
The merger agreement between us and Kolltan (“Merger Agreement”) provides that we will be required to pay Kolltan’s former stockholders contingent consideration in the form of development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones (“Kolltan Milestones”) of up to $172.5 million. Certain Kolltan Milestones related to the METRIC clinical study, TAM partnership closing within two years of the acquisition, CDX-3379 and CDX-0158 have been abandoned and, because of this, as of December 31, 2020, we believe that the adjusted amount we may be required to pay for future consideration is up to $107.5 million contingent upon the achievement of the Kolltan Milestones. We have previously sent abandonment notices to the representative of Kolltan's former stockholders with respect to each of the abandoned Kolltan Milestones, and the representative subsequently objected to the abandonment notices for CDX-3379 and CDX-0158. We disagree with their objection and believe their objection to be without merit. We have filed a Verified Complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking declaratory relief with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties relating to certain contingent milestone payments under the Merger Agreement relating to the discontinued CDX-0158 program. At this time, we are unable to reasonably assess the ultimate outcome of our litigation with the representative of Kolltan’s former stockholders over its objection to our abandonment of certain Kolltan Milestones or determine an estimate of potential losses, if any. Further, there are disagreements between that representative and us with respect to our abandonment notice related to the discontinued CDX-3379 program, which could result in litigation. Because the timing and certainty of these milestones being achieved and the outcome of litigation with the representative of Kolltan’s former stockholders is unknown, these potential future obligations are not included within the table.
