Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Report). In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and in this Report, particularly in “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Overview
LendingClub was founded in 2006 to transform the banking industry by leveraging technology, data science and a marketplace model. We started by bringing a traditional credit product, the installment loan, into the digital age and became the largest provider of unsecured personal loans in the United States. On February 1, 2021, LendingClub completed the acquisition of Radius Bancorp, Inc. (Radius), whereby LendingClub became a bank holding company and formed LendingClub Bank, National Association (the Bank) as its wholly-owned subsidiary, through which we will now operate the vast majority of our business. With the acquisition, we combined the complementary strengths of the Company’s digital lending capabilities with an award-winning digital bank.
Prior to the acquisition, we facilitated loan originations by connecting borrowers with investors through our online lending marketplace platform. However, we relied on third-party issuing banks to originate and fund loans initiated by borrowers, which were then sold to investors. Following the acquisition, the Bank became the originator and lender for our unsecured personal loans and auto loans (Consumer Loans).
As the acquisition occurred after December 31, 2020, the following discussion begins with a historical business model summary and financial review of 2020, followed by a discussion of the implications to our new business model in 2021 as a bank holding company.
Historical Business Model and 2020 Financial Review
Our primary sources of revenue consisted of transaction fees that were paid to us by issuing banks to facilitate loan originations, net interest income and fair value adjustments on loans invested in by the Company, investor fees that compensated us for the costs we incurred in servicing loans, and a gain or loss on sales of loans.
Loans facilitated through our lending marketplace were funded by the sale of whole loans to banks and other institutional investors, the sale of whole loans facilitated through Structured Programs, the issuance of notes to our self-directed retail investors, or funded directly by the Company with its own capital. The Company’s Structured Program transactions included asset-backed securitization transactions and Certificate Program transactions (which consisted of CLUB Certificate and Levered Certificate transactions). The Company continues to be required to retain a portion of the securities from these transactions.
In response to the impact of COVID-19, we quickly initiated a number of measures intended to help both sides of our marketplace navigate the economic environment by providing flexibility for our members and protecting returns for our investors. To provide flexibility to our members, we rapidly launched a number of new hardship/forbearance plans (Payment Plans), including Skip-a-Pay and interest-only plans, and waived late fees for an extended period of time. To help protect investor returns for new loans, we tightened underwriting including increased income verification requirements and increased interest rates on new loans, added capacity to help borrowers over the phone and launched self-service options online for borrowers looking for help.
Investor. When COVID-19’s economic effects were apparent in the latter portion of the first quarter of 2020, there was a reduction in investor demand on our platform reflecting market dislocation for unsecured personal loans,
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
driven in part by uncertainty around consumer credit performance and increased liquidity constraints for certain of our investors. In response, since the second quarter of 2020, the Company has structured incentives to secure the funding commitments of our investors. With the origination volume since increasing, we are beginning to see more platform investors return with reductions in structured incentives. Origination volume for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $912 million, an increase from $584 million in the third quarter of 2020 and an increase from $326 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Borrower. With respect to existing borrowers, the Company is offering Payment Plans to provide relief to those impacted by COVID-19 through deferrals of loan payments. As previously disclosed, we offer eligible borrowers the opportunity to skip monthly payments in two-month increments through our Skip-a-Pay program. We also launched an interest-only hardship plan and continue to launch or plan to launch additional Payment Plans. Borrowers participating in Skip-a-Pay have the terms of their existing loan extended for a commensurate period, which impacts the duration and payment date for loans. As the current regulatory environment for loan forgiveness or waivers of missed payments evolves, our programs, which address these topics, may evolve over time as well.
Borrower behavior in the aggregate has been strong, and among those enrolled in Payment Plans has been encouraging and reflects the desire for borrowers to remain current on their loan payments:
•Total loan borrower performance is strong as of December 31, 2020. Repayment rates remain at pre-COVID-19 levels, and delinquency and roll rates (the percentage of borrowers who progress into later delinquency stages) are lower than historical averages. Newer vintages are displaying better credit performance compared to pre-COVID-19 vintages and lower enrollment rates into our Skip-a-Pay program.
•Performance among those borrowers enrolled in hardship plans is encouraging. Approximately 13% of borrowers have enrolled in a Payment Plan at some point during the life of their loan. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 1% of total borrowers were enrolled in a Payment Plan.
Loan Origination Update
The following table shows the loan origination volume issued, loans purchased or pending purchase by the Company, and the available loan inventory as of the end of each period set forth below (in millions):
(1) LendingClub inventory reflects loans purchased or pending purchase by the Company during the period, excluding loans held by the Company through consolidated trusts, if applicable, and not yet sold as of the period end.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, our marketplace facilitated $912.0 million of loan originations, of which $696.3 million was issued through whole loan sales and $140.6 million was purchased or pending purchase by the Company.
Loan inventory purchased by the Company was 1% of total loan originations during the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease since the second quarter of 2020 was due to lower volumes of loans purchased by the Company due to the strategic decisions we made as a result of COVID-19.

Restructuring
On April 21, 2020, the Company disclosed a restructuring plan to address the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business by repositioning the Company’s expense base to better reflect the reduction in loan volume and better position the Company for profitability and achieving its strategic goals when the economy and business stabilizes. The restructuring plan included workforce reductions affecting approximately 460 employees. The Company recorded restructuring costs of approximately $17 million and $0.8 million in the second and third quarters of 2020, respectively, which included severance and other personnel-related expenses, lease-related expenses and software impairment. The impact of the reduction in workforce is estimated to lower our ongoing quarterly cash compensation expense by approximately $17 million and stock-based compensation expense by approximately $4 million.
2021 Business Model and Implications
We anticipate that additional strategic and financial benefits of the Radius acquisition will include:
•Increased resiliency with access to stable, low-cost deposit funding replacing higher-cost and more volatile third-party warehouse funding;
•Increased and more stable revenue driven by increased net interest income from Consumer Loans held for investment;
•Expense benefits by capturing the fees that were historically paid to our third-party issuing banks; and
•Ability to attract new members and deepen relationships with existing members through the addition of banking services that leverage LendingClub’s marketing and brand strengths.
We fund our Consumer Loan originations through the Company’s marketplace by either selling loans directly to third-party purchasers or investing our own capital in originated loans and holding those loans for investment. The mix of loans held for investment and originated for sale will depend on a number of factors, including origination volumes, bank capital availability and demand from third-party loan investors.
As the originator of Consumer Loans, origination fees from loans held for sale (HFS) will be recorded as a component of marketplace lending revenue. Marketplace lending revenue will also include servicing revenue associated with loan sales. Origination fees and costs from loans held for investment (HFI) will be amortized through interest income over the life of the loans, and the expected credit losses reflected as a charge through earnings. The lifetime estimated credit losses on HFI loans will be initially recognized through earnings when such loans are originated or otherwise acquired, while the interest received will be recognized according to the loan’s contractual payment terms. Due to this timing difference between credit losses taken through earnings and actual charge-offs, we expect earnings to be disproportionately impacted in the near term from the expected organic growth in our HFI loan portfolio before benefiting from higher levels of interest income in later periods.
The change in our business model to being an originating lender with a stable deposit base will also diversify our funding strategy. As we expand our product offerings and grow our loan originations and HFI loan portfolio, we will increasingly rely on funding from customer deposits to prudently manage reliance on wholesale funding sources that tend to be more susceptible to market dislocations during periods of economic stress. We did not share in any interest rate or credit risk on the loans facilitated through our lending marketplace that were funded by Member Payment Dependent Notes (Retail Notes), certificates and certain secured borrowings because loan balances, interest rates and maturities were matched and offset by an equal balance of notes, certificates or secured borrowings with the exact same interest rates and maturities. As of December 31, 2020, LendingClub ceased offering and selling Retail Notes. The total balance of outstanding Retail Notes will continue to decline as underlying borrower payments are made.

The formation of the Bank as a nationally chartered association and the organization of our Parent as a bank holding company subjects us to various capital adequacy guidelines issued by the OCC and FRB, including the requirement to maintain minimum regulatory capital ratios in accordance with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision standardized approach for U.S. banking organizations (U.S. Basel III). In addition to these guidelines and as part of our regulatory approvals, we have made various commitments to the regulators in order to demonstrate that we will operate the bank in a safe and sound manner. See “Liquidity and Capital Management” for additional information.
The acquisition of Radius will be accounted for as a purchase business combination, with the purchase price allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on February 1, 2021, with the residual difference recorded as goodwill. These estimates, along with our estimate of the acquisition date allowance for Radius HFI loan losses, required under ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, to be charged through earnings, will be provided in our March 31, 2021 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The acquisition will also significantly change the presentation of our financial statements in future periods. Going forward, our financial statements will be structured according to the presentation requirements for bank holding companies under Article 9 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X.
As our transition to a bank holding company occurred after year-end, the following discussion, unless otherwise stated, discusses our Results of Operations under our historical business model.
Key Operating and Financial Metrics
We regularly review several metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. The following presents our key operating and financial metrics:
(1) See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4. Net Income (Loss) Per Share” and “Note 15. Stockholders' Equity” for additional information.
(2) Represents non-GAAP financial measures. For more information regarding these measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Loan Originations
We classified the loans facilitated by our platform into three major loan products: standard program personal loans, custom program personal loans and other loans. During 2020, the majority of the loans facilitated through our platform were standard program personal loans that represent loans made to prime borrowers that are available to
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
institutional investors, private investors and public investors (in the form of Retail Notes). Custom program personal loans include all other personal loans to borrowers who are not eligible for our standard program, including loans primarily made to near-prime and super-prime borrowers, and are available only to private investors. Other loans are comprised of education and patient finance loans, auto refinance loans, and small business loans. In 2019, the Company announced that it will connect applicants looking for a small business loan with strategic partners and earn referral fees, instead of facilitating these loans on its platform. Because we ceased offering and selling Retail Notes as of December 31, 2020, the distinction between our standard program and custom program personal loans will no longer be relevant for future periods.
Loan origination volume and weighted-average transaction fees (as a percent of origination balance) by major loan products are as follows:
Personal loan origination volume for our standard loan program by loan grade was as follows (in millions):
N/M - Not meaningful
Credit and pricing policy changes made by the Company during 2019 and into 2020 resulted in a change in the mix of personal loan origination volume from higher risk grades D through F to lower risk A through C grades. These changes broadly focused on tightening credit to shift overall platform mix towards lower risk and higher credit quality borrowers.

Transaction Fees
Transaction fees are fees paid by issuing banks or education and patient service providers to us for the work we performed in facilitating the origination of loans by our issuing bank partners. With respect to all unsecured personal loans and auto refinance loans for which WebBank acted as the issuing bank, we recorded transaction fee revenue net of program fees paid to WebBank. The fees on these loans are based upon the terms of the loan, including grade, rate, term, channel and other factors. As of December 31, 2020, these fees ranged from 0% to 6% of the initial principal amount of a loan. In connection with the acquisition of Radius, the Bank originates loans and the origination fee paid by borrowers is provided directly to, and retained by, us.
Transaction fees were $207.6 million and $598.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 65%. The decrease was due to lower origination volume, primarily due to the impact of
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
COVID-19. Loans facilitated through our lending marketplace decreased to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $12.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 65%. The average transaction fee as a percentage of the initial principal balance of the loan was 4.78% in 2020 compared to 4.87% in 2019.
In January 2021, we recognized approximately $1.8 million in transaction fee revenue associated with the issuance of loans for which the loan application process had commenced prior to the end of 2020. In January 2020, we recognized approximately $3.6 million in transaction fee revenue associated with the issuance of loans for which the loan application process had commenced prior to the end of 2019.
Net Interest Income and Fair Value Adjustments
Loans Invested in by the Company: In light of COVID-19 and our acquisition of Radius, the Company ceased purchasing loans to support Structured Program transactions. We earn interest income and assume principal and interest rate risk on loans during the period we own the loans. We previously financed a portion of loan purchases with draws on our credit facilities and the associated interest expense reduced net interest income. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we fully repaid and terminated our credit facilities.
Fair value adjustments on loans invested in by the Company are generally negative due to interest cash flow receipts and if there are expected increases and any acceleration in the timing of expected charge-offs and prepayments. As the portfolio of loans invested in by the Company prior to the acquisition of Radius runs off, the Company expects the net negative fair value adjustments on those loans to decrease over the remaining holding period of those loans, absent any significant market price volatility.
Loans, Notes, Certificates and Secured Borrowings: We do not assume principal or interest rate risk on loans facilitated through our lending marketplace that were funded by notes, certificates and certain secured borrowings because loan balances, interest rates and maturities are matched and offset by an equal balance of notes, certificates or secured borrowings with the exact same interest rates and maturities. The changes in fair value of loans, notes, certificates and secured borrowings are shown on our Consolidated Statements of Operations on a net basis. Due to the payment dependent feature of the notes, certificates and secured borrowings, fair value adjustments on loans funded with notes, certificates and secured borrowings resulted in no net effect on our earnings, except for changes in fair value of any applicable credit support agreements related to secured borrowings.

Interest income associated with loans invested in by the Company, securities available for sale, and cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $93.7 million and $131.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 28%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance of loans invested in by the Company and a decrease in interest rates for cash and cash equivalents.
Interest expense associated with credit facilities, securities sold under repurchase agreements and securitization notes and certificates was $25.6 million and $32.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 21%. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest rates and a decrease in the average outstanding balance of credit facilities and securities sold under repurchase agreements.
Net fair value adjustments were $(117.2) million and $(145.0) million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 19%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in loans purchased by the Company, partially offset by fair value adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19, which included an increase in estimated expected credit losses.
Interest income from loans held for investment and the offsetting interest expense from notes, certificates and secured borrowings were both $116.0 million and $214.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 46%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding balances of loans held for investment and notes, certificates and secured borrowings.

Investor Fees
The tables below illustrate the composition of investor fees and the outstanding principal balance of loans serviced, which is a key driver of investor fees, by the method in which the loans were financed for each period presented:
(1) As of the end of each respective period.
(1) Funds are the private funds for which LendingClub Asset Management, LLC (LCAM, a previously held wholly-owned subsidiary of LendingClub), or its subsidiaries acted as general partner. In March 2019, we completed the dissolution of those funds.
(2) As of the end of each respective period.
The Company receives fees to compensate us for the costs we incur in servicing a loan, including managing payments from borrowers, collections, payments to investors, maintaining investors’ account portfolios, providing information, and issuing monthly statements. The amount of investor fee revenue earned is predominantly affected by the servicing rates paid by investors, the outstanding principal balance of loans and the amount of principal and interest collected from borrowers and remitted to investors.
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Investor fee revenue related to whole loans sold also includes the change in fair value of our servicing assets and liabilities associated with the loans. Servicing rights are recorded as either an asset or liability in “Gain on sales of loans” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Investor fees - whole loans sold: Investor fee revenue related to the servicing of whole loans sold was $96.5 million and $100.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 4%. The decrease in revenue resulting from a lower principal balance of loans serviced was substantially offset by an increase from higher average contractual servicing fees and delinquent loan collections.
Investor fees - notes, certificates and secured borrowings: Investor fee revenue related to the servicing of loans underlying notes, certificates and secured borrowings was $15.3 million and $24.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 37%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower principal balance of loans serviced and a decrease in delinquent loan collections and charged-off loan sales.
Gain (Loss) on Sales of Loans
In connection with loan sales and Structured Program transactions, in addition to investor fees earned with respect to the corresponding loan, we recognize a gain or loss on the sale of that loan based on the level to which the contractual loan servicing fee is above or below an estimated market rate loan servicing fee. Additionally, we recognize transactions costs as a loss on sale of loans.
Gain on sales of loans was $30.8 million and $67.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 54%. The decrease was due to a decrease in the volume of loans sold that resulted in lower gains on sales of loans.
Other Revenue
Other revenue primarily consists of sublease revenue from our sublet office space in San Francisco, California, and referral revenue that relates to fees earned from third-party companies when customers referred by us consider or purchase products or services from such third-party companies. The table below illustrates the composition of other revenue for each period presented:

Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, origination and servicing, engineering and product development and other general and administrative expenses, as described below.
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Sales and Marketing: Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of borrower and investor acquisition efforts, including costs attributable to marketing and selling the loans facilitated through the platform we operate. This includes costs of building general brand awareness, and salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our sales and marketing team.
Origination and Servicing: Origination and servicing expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense and vendor costs attributable to activities that most directly relate to facilitating the origination of loans and servicing loans for borrowers and investors. These costs relate to the credit, collections, customer support and payment processing teams and related vendors.
Engineering and Product Development: Engineering and product development expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our engineering and product management teams, information security and technology risk teams, and the cost of contractors who work on the development and maintenance of our platform. Engineering and product development expense also includes non-capitalized hardware and software costs and depreciation, amortization and impairment of technology assets.
Other General and Administrative: Other general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our accounting, finance, legal, risk, compliance, human resources and facilities teams, professional services fees and facilities expense.
Sales and marketing: Sales and marketing expense was $79.1 million and $279.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 72%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in variable marketing expenses based on lower origination volume and a decrease in personnel-related expenses for full-time employees due to lower headcount as a result of a workforce reduction in the second quarter of 2020. Sales and marketing expense as a percent of loan originations decreased to 1.82% in 2020 from 2.27% in 2019 as a result of a decrease in loan origination volume in our higher-cost marketing channels.
Origination and servicing: Origination and servicing expense was $71.2 million and $103.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 31%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses for full-time employees due to lower headcount as a result of a workforce reduction in
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
the second quarter of 2020, reduction in outsourced workforce in the second half of 2020, and lower third-party origination credit expenses as a result of lower origination volume.
Engineering and product development: Engineering and product development expense was $139.1 million and $168.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 17%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses for full-time employees due to lower headcount as a result of a workforce reduction in the second quarter of 2020 and lower depreciation expense, partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs relating to the workforce reduction.
We capitalized $28.2 million and $36.1 million in software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Other general and administrative expense: Other general and administrative expense was $213.0 million and $238.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 11%. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel-related expenses for full-time employees due to lower headcount as a result of a workforce reduction in the second quarter of 2020 and lower professional services and facilities expense, partially offset by increases in expenses related to the acquisition of Radius and restructuring costs related to the workforce reduction.
Income Taxes
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $79 thousand and $201 thousand, respectively. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to current state income taxes. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the tax effects of other comprehensive income associated with the Company’s available for sale portfolio.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law to provide certain relief as a result of COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has determined that neither the CARES Act nor changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law and extends several provisions of the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has determined that neither this Act nor changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions have a significant impact on our effective tax rate.
We continue to recognize a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. This determination was based on the assessment of the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Financial Information
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our operating results. We believe that Contribution, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (Adjusted EPS) and Net Cash and Other Financial Assets help identify trends in our core business results and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management in its decision making.
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
Our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for, or superior to, net income (loss) as prepared in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their most directly comparable GAAP measures, which include the following:
•Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.
•Although depreciation, impairment and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, impaired and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements.
•These measures do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us.
Contribution and Contribution Margin
Contribution is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as net revenue less “Sales and marketing” and “Origination and servicing” expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, adjusted to exclude cost structure simplification, restructuring costs, other items (related to one-time expenses resulting from COVID-19) and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses within these captions and income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. These costs represent the costs that are most directly related to generating such revenue. The adjustment for cost structure simplification expense relates to a review of our cost structure and a number of expense initiatives underway, including the establishment of a site in the Salt Lake City area. The expense includes incremental and excess personnel-related expenses associated with establishing our Salt Lake City area site and external advisory fees. The adjustment for restructuring costs included severance and other personnel-related expenses, lease-related expenses and software impairment related to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business. Contribution margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by dividing Contribution by total net revenue.
Contribution and Contribution Margin are measures of overall direct product profitability that our management and board of directors find useful, and believe investors may find useful, in understanding the relationship between costs most directly associated with revenue generating activities and the related revenue, and remaining amount available to support our costs of engineering and product development and other general and administrative expense to evaluate our operating performance and trends. While we believe Contribution and Contribution Margin are useful for the reasons above, they are not an overall measure of our profitability, as they exclude engineering and product development and other general and administrative expenses that are required to run our business. Factors that affect our Contribution and Contribution Margin include revenue mix, variable marketing expenses and origination and servicing expenses.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income (loss) attributable to LendingClub adjusted to exclude certain items that are either non-recurring, do not contribute directly to management’s evaluation of its operating results, or non-cash items, such as (1) expenses related to our cost structure simplification, as discussed above, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) legal, regulatory and other expense related to legacy issues, (4) acquisition and related expenses, (5) restructuring costs and (6) other items (consisting of certain non-legacy litigation and/or regulatory settlement expenses, gains on disposal of certain assets, and expenses resulting from COVID-19), net of tax. Legacy items are generally those expenses that arose from the decisions of legacy management prior to the board review initiated in 2016 and resulted in the resignation of our former CEO, including legal and other costs associated with ongoing regulatory and government investigations, indemnification obligations, litigation, and termination of certain legacy contracts. In the second quarter of 2020, we added an adjustment to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for “Restructuring costs” to adjust for severance and other personnel-related expenses, lease-related expenses and software impairment related to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we added an adjustment to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for “Acquisition and related expenses” to adjust for costs related to the acquisition of Radius. In the second quarter of 2019, we added an adjustment to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA for “Other items” to adjust for expenses or gains that are not part of our core operating results. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is an important measure because it directly reflects the financial performance of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income (loss) attributable to LendingClub adjusted to exclude certain items that are either non-recurring, do not contribute directly to management's evaluation of its operating results, or non-cash items, such as (1) cost structure simplification expense, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) legal, regulatory and other expense related to legacy issues, (4) acquisition and related expenses, (5) restructuring costs, (6) other items, as discussed above, (7) depreciation, impairment and amortization expense, (8) stock-based compensation expense and (9) income tax expense (benefit). We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and our board to evaluate and compare our core operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period. Additionally, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA as an input into the Company’s calculation of the annual bonus plan. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total net revenue.

Adjusted EPS
Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to both common and preferred stockholders by the weighted-average diluted common and preferred shares outstanding. We believe that Adjusted EPS is an important measure because it directly reflects the core operating results of our business on a per share basis, which analysts have informed us provides a useful comparison from period to period without unusual or non-recurring items.
The following table presents a calculation of Adjusted EPS for each of the periods indicated:
(1) Presented on an as-converted basis, as the preferred stock is considered common shares because it participates in earnings similar to common stock and does not receive any significant preferences over the common stock.
(2) See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4. Net Income (Loss) Per Share” and “Note 15. Stockholders' Equity” for additional information.
(3) Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, includes the total weighted-average shares outstanding of both common and preferred stock on an as-converted basis.
Supplemental Financial Information
The following table is provided to delineate between the assets and liabilities belonging to our member payment dependent self-directed retail program (Retail Program) note holders and certain VIEs that we are required to consolidate in accordance with GAAP. Such assets are not legally ours and the associated liabilities are payable only from the cash flows generated by those assets (i.e. Pass-throughs). As such, these debt holders do not have a secured interest in any other assets of LendingClub. We believe this is a useful measure because it illustrates the overall financial stability and operating leverage of the Company.
(1) Represents loans held for investment at fair value that were funded directly by our Retail Program notes. The liabilities are only payable from the cash flows generated by the associated assets. We do not assume principal or interest rate risk on loans facilitated through our lending marketplace that were funded by our Retail Program because loan balances, interest rates and maturities are matched and offset by an equal balance of notes with the exact same interest rates and maturities. We do not retain any economic interests from our Retail Program. Interest expense on Retail Program notes of $98.3 million and $148.0 million was equally matched and offset by interest income from the related loans of $98.3 million and $148.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting in no net effect on our Net interest income and fair value adjustments.
(2) Represents assets and equal and offsetting liabilities of certain VIEs that we are required to consolidate in accordance with GAAP, but which are not legally ours. The liabilities are only payable from the cash flows generated by the associated
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
assets. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the Company. Interest expense on these liabilities owned by third parties of $123.2 million and net fair value adjustments of $9.4 million in 2020 were equally matched and offset by interest income on the loans of $134.6 million, resulting in no net effect on our Net interest income and fair value adjustments. Interest expense on these liabilities owned by third parties of $70.8 million and net fair value adjustments of $13.5 million in 2019 were equally matched and offset by interest income on the loans of $84.3 million, resulting in no net effect on our Net interest income and fair value adjustments. Economic interests held by LendingClub, including retained interests, residuals and equity of the VIEs, are reflected in “Loans held for sale by the Company at fair value,” “Loans held for investment by the Company at fair value” and “Restricted cash,” respectively, within the “All Other LendingClub” column.
(3) Represents all other assets and liabilities of LendingClub, other than those related to our Retail Program and certain consolidated VIEs, but includes any economic interests held by LendingClub, including retained interests, residuals and equity of those consolidated VIEs.
(4) The Company has sponsored Structured Program transactions that have been consolidated, resulting in an increase to “Loans held for investment by the Company at fair value,” “Loans held for sale by the Company at fair value” and the related “Payable to Structured Program note and certificate holders at fair value.” See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14. Debt” for additional information.
Net Cash and Other Financial Assets
The following table provides additional detail related to components of our Net Cash and Other Financial Assets. We believe Net Cash and Other Financial Assets is a useful measure because it illustrates the overall financial stability and operating leverage of the Company. This measure is calculated as cash and certain other assets and liabilities, including loans and securities available for sale, which are partially secured and offset by related credit facilities, and working capital.
(1) Variations in cash and cash equivalents are primarily due to variations in the amount and timing of loan purchases invested in by the Company and the corresponding loan sales.
(2) Represents cash and cash equivalents that are transferred to restricted cash for loans that are pending purchase by the Company.
(3) The Company has sponsored Structured Program transactions that have been consolidated, resulting in an increase to “Loans held for investment by the Company at fair value” and the related “Payable to Structured Program note and certificate holders at fair value.” See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14. Debt” for additional information.

(4) “Other assets and liabilities” is a total of “Accrued interest receivable,” “Other assets,” “Accounts payable,” “Accrued interest payable” and “Accrued expenses and other liabilities,” included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This line item represents certain assets and liabilities that impact working capital and are affected by timing differences between revenue and expense recognition and related cash activity.
(5) Comparable GAAP measure cannot be provided as not practicable.
Segment Information
The Company defines its operating segments by the loan product types of personal, education and patient finance, and auto. While each of these product types are considered operating segments, they are aggregated to represent one reportable segment as the education and patient finance and auto loan operating segments are immaterial both individually and in the aggregate. With the acquisition of Radius, the Company is in the process of reorganizing its management structure and defining its operating segments.
Investments in Quarterly Originations by Investment Channel and Investor Concentration
During 2020, our investment channels consisted of (1) Managed accounts and Other institutional investors, which primarily include other non-bank investors, dedicated third-party funds, and public and private funds managed by third-party asset managers, (2) Banks, which are deposit taking institutions or their affiliates, (3) self-directed retail investors, and (4) LendingClub inventory, which includes loan originations purchased by the Company during the period and not yet sold as of the period end.
The following table shows the percentage of loan origination volume issued in the period and purchased or pending purchase by each investment channel as of the end of each period presented:
(1)LendingClub inventory reflects loans purchased or pending purchase by the Company during the period, excluding loans held by the Company through consolidated trusts, if applicable, and not yet sold as of the period end.
The loan origination volume decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to fourth quarter of 2019 was driven by tighter underwriting criteria due to the impact of COVID-19. This reduction in investor demand resulted in mix changes across our investment channels. In addition, in response to COVID-19 and the related capital market dislocation and planning for the acquisition of Radius, the Company significantly reduced using its own capital to fund the purchase of loans.
Now that LendingClub has become a full-spectrum marketplace bank, we have started development of new products aimed to better serve our customers. As part of this strategic initiative, as previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 7, 2020, LendingClub ceased offering and selling Retail Notes to self-directed retail investors as of December 31, 2020.
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
The following table provides the percentage of loans invested in by the ten largest external investors and by the largest single investor during each of the previous five quarters (by dollars invested):
The composition of the top ten investors may vary from period to period. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the percentage of loans invested in by the Company’s ten largest investors increased compared to the prior year, as a result of a decrease in loan origination volume and an increase in the mix of loans purchased on our platform by bank and managed account investors. A reduction in investor demand furthered investor concentration to a limited number of purchasers that are continuing to purchase loans but are currently doing so at lower volumes relative to historical purchasing activity.
Effectiveness of Scoring Models
Our ability to attract borrowers and investors to our lending marketplace is significantly dependent on our platform’s ability to effectively evaluate a borrower’s credit profile.
Our online lending marketplace platform’s credit decisioning and scoring models are evaluated on a regular basis and the additional data on loan history experience, borrower behavior and prepayment trends that we accumulate are leveraged to continually improve our underwriting models. We believe we have the experience to effectively evaluate a borrower’s creditworthiness and likelihood of default. If our lending marketplace’s credit decisioning and scoring models ultimately prove to be ineffective or fail to appropriately account for a decline in future macroeconomic environment, investors may experience higher than expected losses.
Our current underwriting model leverages a number of custom attributes developed by LendingClub. We modify our credit and pricing policies, leveraging insights on current market conditions and recent vintage performance.
The charts provided below display the historical lifetime cumulative net charge-off rates (expressed as a percent of original loan balances) through December 31, 2020, by booking year, for all standard program loans and 36-month or 60-month terms for each of the years shown. The charts display lifetime cumulative net charge-off rates using months on book for each annual vintage presented. Each annual vintage’s lifetime cumulative net charge-offs vary based on the maturity of each loan’s month on book. In the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, standard program loans accounted for 68% and 69%, respectively, of all loan origination volume.

Loan Portfolio Information and Credit Metrics
Fair Value and Delinquencies
For loans held for investment that are backed by notes, certificates and secured borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, the outstanding principal balance, fair value and percentage of loans that are delinquent, by loan product, are as follows:
(1) Expressed as a percent of outstanding principal balance.
For loans invested in directly by the Company for which there were no associated notes, certificates or secured borrowings, the outstanding principal balance, fair value and percentage of loans that are delinquent, by loan product, are as follows:
(1) Components of other loans are less than 10% of the outstanding principal balance if presented individually.
(2) Includes both loans held for investment and loans held for sale.
(3) Expressed as a percent of outstanding principal balance.
Decreases in the fair value of total loans invested in by the Company as a percent of outstanding principal balance from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 were primarily due to changes in market conditions, including an increase in estimated expected credit losses and an increase in liquidity premium due to market dislocation relating to COVID-19. In addition, loans to eligible borrowers participating in Skip-a-Pay are not considered delinquent during the commensurate period the loan is extended.
Net Annualized Charge-Off Rates
The following tables show annualized net charge-off rates, which are a measure of the performance of the loans facilitated by our platform. In contrast to the graphs above, these tables show the annualized charged-off balance of loans in a specific period as a percentage of the average outstanding balance for such period.
Net annualized charge-off rates are affected by the average age and grade distribution of the loans outstanding for a given quarter and the credit performance of those loans. Additionally, in any particular quarter the portfolios include loans from past vintages that were originated under prior credit underwriting parameters, and thus do not reflect the current credit underwriting parameters used to originate new loans.
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
The annualized net charge-off rates for personal loans for both standard and custom programs in total for the last five quarters were as follows:
(1) Total platform comprises all loans facilitated through our lending marketplace, including whole loans sold and loans financed by notes, certificates and secured borrowings, but excluding education and patient finance loans, auto refinance loans and small business loans.
The annualized net charge-off rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased for both the standard and custom personal loan programs. The decrease was primarily due to improved performance from customers who have never taken a hardship plan, partially offset by a higher charge-off rate from customers who have enrolled in a hardship plan.
The increase in the weighted-average age in months in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 for both the standard and custom personal loan programs is primarily due to lower origination volume and the aging of the existing platform portfolio.
The annualized net charge-off rates for personal loans for both standard and custom programs for loans retained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the last five quarters were as follows:
(1) Loans retained on balance sheet include loans invested in by the Company as well as loans held for investment that are funded directly by member payment dependent notes related to our Retail Program and certificates.
The decrease in annualized net charge-off rates for the standard personal loan program in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 for the loans retained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily reflects a greater decrease in actual net charge-offs proportionate to the decrease in outstanding loan balances. The decrease in actual net charge-offs primarily reflects the effect of Payment Plans to provide relief to those impacted by COVID-19 and improved performance from customers who have never taken a hardship plan.

Regulatory Environment
We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, lawsuits alleging regulatory violations, government (including state agencies) and regulatory exams, investigations, inquiries or requests, and other proceedings. The number and significance of these claims, lawsuits, exams, investigations, inquiries, requests and proceedings have been increasing in part because our business expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services increased in complexity. At this time, the Company is not able to project the impact of becoming a bank holding company operating a national bank on the number or significance of such matters.
State Inquiries and Licensing
We have historically conducted business through nonbank entities, some of which maintain or maintained various financial services licenses in numerous jurisdictions. Much of our business activity is now conducted through the Bank pursuant to the laws applicable to national banks. Nevertheless, our nonbank entities continue to maintain certain state licenses and may continue to be subject to the regulation, supervision and enforcement of various state regulatory authorities with respect to the legacy or residual activities.
We are subject to examination by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and regulators in other states with respect to the period prior to our acquisition of Radius and becoming a bank holding company operating a national bank. These exams have included the application of state usury rates and lending arrangements where a bank or other third party has made a loan and then sells and assigns it to an entity that is engaged in assisting with the origination or servicing of a loan. For example, in July 2018, the NYDFS issued an Online Lending Report (Lending Report). The Lending Report included, among other things, an analysis of the online lenders operating in New York including their methods of operations, lending practices, interest rates and costs, products offered and complaints and investigations relating to online lenders. The Lending Report also included information and recommendations regarding protecting New York’s markets and consumers. Although the Lending Report noted that the rapid growth of online lending demonstrates there is value to new technologies that allow financial institutions to connect with borrowers in new ways, it noted that in many cases an online lender is the “true lender” and that lending in New York, whether through banks, credit unions or online lenders, should be subject to applicable usury limits. We have periodically had discussions with various regulatory agencies regarding our historical business model and engaged in similar discussions with the NYDFS and other regulators. During the course of such discussions, we decided to voluntarily comply with certain rules and regulations.
Prior to discontinuing the offer and sale of Retail Notes in December 2020, the Company undertook a review of its portfolio of licenses and had discussions with regulators in Texas, Arizona, New York, Florida and North Dakota concerning the registrations required for the Company’s issuance of Retail Notes to investors in these states and applied for registrations in these states to facilitate these operations. The Company had discussions with certain of these regulators to resolve concerns regarding the Company’s historical licensing/registration status in connection with Retail Notes issued and reached resolutions with Texas, Arizona and North Dakota to resolve their concerns, the outcome of which is not material to the Company’s operations or financial position. The Company is not able to predict with certainty the timing, outcome, or consequence of discussions, with the remaining states, including in relation to whether and how any concerns those states have will be resolved. Discussions with these remaining states could result in fines or other penalties, which are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations or results of operations.
Regulatory Actions Taken in Relation to COVID-19
Regulators and government officials at the federal government level and in states across the country have issued orders, passed laws or otherwise issued guidance in connection with COVID-19. Some of these orders and laws have placed restrictions on debt collection activity, all or certain types of communications with delinquent borrowers or others, required that borrowers be allowed to defer payments on outstanding debt, govern credit
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted)
reporting and the use of credit reporting, and placed certain restrictions and requirements on operations in the workplace. We have taken steps to monitor regulatory developments relating to COVID-19 and to comply with orders and laws applicable to our business. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, it is possible that additional orders, laws, or regulatory guidance may still be issued. The Company is not able to predict the extent of the impact on its business from any regulatory activity relating to or resulting from COVID-19.
Consequences
If we are found to not have complied with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, we could: (i) lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations, (ii) become subject to a consent order or administrative enforcement action, (iii) face lawsuits (including class action lawsuits), sanctions, penalties, or other monetary losses due to judgments, orders, or settlements, (iv) be in breach of certain contracts, which may void or cancel such contracts, (v) decide or be compelled to modify or suspend certain of our business practices, (vi) be unable to execute on certain Company initiatives, or (vii) be required to obtain a license in such jurisdiction, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to operate and/or evolve our lending marketplace and other products and/or services; any of which may harm our business or financial results.
See “Part I - Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision,” “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Regulation, Supervision and Compliance,” and “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operating Our Business” for further discussion regarding our regulatory environment.
Liquidity and Capital Management
Liquidity
Our short-term liquidity needs historically have been satisfied through cash generated from the operations of facilitating loan originations, servicing fee revenue, proceeds from the sales of loans (both as whole loan sales and through Structured Program transactions), principal and interest received on loans invested in by the Company, use of existing cash and cash equivalents, and draws on our credit facilities. Market dislocations from COVID-19 throughout 2020 resulted in a significant reduction in loan origination volume, which impacted transaction fee revenue.
We prepared for the acquisition of Radius in part by selling approximately $470 million of HFS loans in the second half of 2020 and reducing leverage through eliminating the Company’s use of credit facilities, with the objective of realizing the significant value we believe this acquisition creates for the Company. Funding activities were reduced to prioritize excess cash for the completion of the Radius transaction and to inject additional capital to the Bank at the close of the acquisition to facilitate future growth. Further, to prepare for the transition to a bank-based liquidity management framework and the migration of operations into the Bank, the Company ceased the purchase of loans for Structured Program transactions.
The acquisition will enhance our liquidity management strategy by diversifying our funding sources and providing greater stability to our earnings. The stable and lower-cost deposit base will be leveraged to enable marketplace loan origination growth and the opportunity to retain loans for investment. We believe this will strengthen the resiliency of our business model by limiting our reliance on higher-cost and more volatile liquidity sources, including wholesale funding and Structured Program transactions, and reduce our balance sheet’s exposure to fluctuations in fair values during periods of market disruptions. Additionally, fee revenue from our marketplace lending activities and net interest income from loans retained on the balance sheet will generate additional liquidity and capital to facilitate loan growth. These activities will become our principal source of cash flows generated from operations. The acquisition also provides access to conduct secured borrowings through the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the Federal Reserve’s discount window.
LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION

See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14. Debt” for further information.
We may use our cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale as additional sources of liquidity. Our cash and cash equivalents of $525.0 million as of December 31, 2020 are primarily held in interest-bearing deposit accounts at investment-grade financial institutions. We used approximately $395 million of our cash on hand to complete the Radius acquisition, including a $250 million infusion to further capitalize the Bank. Consistent with the bank holding company serving as a source of strength for the Bank, the remaining cash balance, excluding restricted cash, will be available to maintain liquidity and capital at the bank holding company.
Principal and interest payments due on our legacy notes and certificates are paid only when received from borrowers on the corresponding retained loans, resulting in no material impact to our liquidity.
Future cash requirements include certain contingent liabilities, including litigations and ongoing regulatory and government investigations primarily related to outstanding legacy issues. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $21.6 million and $16.0 million in accrued contingent liabilities, respectively, but actual cash payments may vary if outcomes of legal actions or settlements are different. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies” for further information.
We believe, based on our projections, that our cash flow from operations are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows” for additional detail regarding our cash flows.
Capital Management
Net capital expenditures were $31.1 million, or 10% of total net revenue, $50.7 million, or 7% of total net revenue, and $53.0 million, or 8% of total net revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures generally consist of internally developed software, leasehold improvements and computer equipment. Capital expenditures in 2021 are expected to be approximately $40 million, primarily related to costs associated with the continued development and support of our online lending marketplace platform.
With the Radius acquisition and the ensuing shift in our business model to holding more loans on the balance sheet of the Bank, the prudent management of capital is fundamental to the successful achievement of our business initiatives. We actively manage capital through a process that continuously assesses and monitors the Company’s overall capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations.
The formation of the Bank as a nationally chartered association and the organization of the Company as a bank holding company subjects us to various capital adequacy guidelines issued by the OCC and FRB, including the requirement to maintain regulatory capital ratios in accordance with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision standardized approach for U.S. banking organizations (U.S. Basel III). The capital requirements in order to be regarded as a well-capitalized institution under the U.S. Basel III capital framework are as follows: a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition to these guidelines, the banking regulators may require a banking organization to maintain capital at levels higher than the minimum ratios prescribed under the U.S. Basel III capital framework. In this regard, and unless otherwise directed by the OCC, we have made commitments for the Bank to maintain a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio above 11%, a total risk-based capital ratio above 13% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11% for a minimum of three years following its formation.

For further information on the U.S. Basel III framework, see “Part I - Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision - Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action.”
Contingencies
For a comprehensive discussion of contingencies as of December 31, 2020, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.”
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, a total of $5.5 million in standby letters of credit were outstanding related to certain financial covenants required for our leased facilities. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through July 2026.
In the ordinary course of business, we engage in other activities that are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities involve our Structured Program transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities including Company-sponsored securitizations and Certificate Program transactions. These transactions are used by the Company to provide a source of liquidity to finance our business and to diversify our investor base. The Company retains at least 5% of securities and residual interests from these transactions and enters into a servicing arrangement with the unconsolidated variable interest entity. We are exposed to market risk in the securitization market. We provide additional information regarding transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7. Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities.”
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the consolidated financial statements. We consider certain of these policies to be critical accounting policies as they require significant judgments, assumptions and estimates which we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are inherently subjective and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, and the differences could be material.
Fair Value of Loans Held for Investment, Loans Invested in by the Company, Notes and Certificates
We have elected the fair value option for loans held for investment and related notes and certificates, as well as loans invested in by the Company. We primarily use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. This model uses both observable and unobservable inputs and reflects our best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. The following describes the primary inputs that require significant judgment:
Expected loss rates - Expected loss rates are estimates of the principal payments that will not be repaid over the life of a loan held for investment, loan invested in by the Company, note or certificate. Expected loss rates are adjusted to reflect the expected principal recoveries on charged-off loans. Expected loss rates are primarily based on the historical performance of the loans facilitated on our platform but also incorporate discretionary adjustments based on our expectations of future credit performance.
Prepayments - Prepayments are estimates of the amount of principal payments that will occur before they are contractually required during the life of a loan held for investment, loan invested in by the Company, note or certificate. Prepayments reduce the projected principal balances, interest payments and expected time loans are

outstanding. Prepayment expectations are primarily based on the historical performance of the loans facilitated on our platform but also incorporate discretionary adjustments based on our expectations of future loan performance.
Discount rates - The discount rates applied to the expected cash flows of loans held for investment and related notes and certificates, as well as loans invested in by the Company, reflect our estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in financial instruments with similar risk and return characteristics.
Fair Value of Asset-backed Securities related to Structured Program Transactions
We classify asset-backed securities related to Structured Program transactions as securities available for sale. These securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets unless management determines that a security is impaired due to a deterioration in expected cash flows, in which case the unrealized loss is recognized in earnings as a valuation allowance for credit losses.
We estimate fair value based on the price of transactions for similar instruments if available. If market observable prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. This model uses inputs that are both observable and not observable and reflect our best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. The following describes the primary inputs that require significant judgment:
Expected loss rates - Expected loss rates are estimates of the principal payments that will not be repaid over the life of loans backing the security. Expected loss rates are adjusted to reflect the expected principal recoveries on charged-off loans. Expected loss rates are primarily based on the historical performance of the loans facilitated on our platform but also incorporate discretionary adjustments based on our expectations of future credit performance.
Prepayments - Prepayments are estimates of the amount of principal payments that will occur before they are contractually required during the life of loans backing the security. Prepayments reduce the projected principal balances, interest payments and expected time loans are outstanding. Prepayment expectations are primarily based on the historical performance of the loans facilitated on our platform but also incorporate discretionary adjustments based on our expectations of future loan performance.
Discount rates - The discount rates for asset-backed securities reflect our estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in financial instruments with similar risk and return characteristics. The primary source of discount rate observations is the rate of return implied by sales of comparable asset-backed securities.
Fair Value of Servicing Assets
We record servicing assets at their estimated fair values when we sell loans or we assume or acquire a servicing obligation whereby the underlying loans are not included in our financial statements. The gain or loss on a loan sale is recorded separately in “Gain on sales of loans” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations while the component of the gain or loss that is based on the degree to which the contractual servicing fee is above or below an estimated market servicing rate is recorded as a servicing asset. Servicing assets are reported in “Other assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of servicing assets are reported in “Investor fees” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the changes occur.
We use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair values of loan servicing assets. The cash flows in the valuation model represent the difference between the servicing fees charged and an estimated market servicing rate. Since servicing fees are generally based on the monthly unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans, the

expected cash flows in the model incorporate estimated net expected losses and expected prepayments. The significant assumptions used in valuing our servicing assets are:
Market servicing rates - We consider market servicing rates as those rates which a market participant would require to service the loans that we sell. We estimate these market servicing rates based on our review of available observable market servicing rates.
Discount rates - The discount rates for loan servicing rights reflect our estimates of the rates of return that investors in servicing rights for unsecured consumer credit obligations would require when investing in similar servicing rights.
We also incorporate estimates of net losses and prepayments in our estimation of fair value of servicing assets. These inputs are consistent with the assumptions used in the valuation of loans held for investment and related notes and certificates, as well as loans invested in by the Company.
Loss Contingencies
Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Associated legal expense is recorded in “Other general and administrative” expense or in “Class action and regulatory litigation expense” for the losses associated with the securities class action lawsuits, as described in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such liabilities and associated expenses are recorded when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company will also disclose a range of exposure to incremental loss when such amounts are reasonably possible and can be estimated. In estimating the Company’s exposure to loss contingencies, if an amount within the estimated range of loss is the best estimate, that amount will be accrued. However, if there is no amount within the estimated range of loss that is the best estimate, the Company will accrue the minimum amount within the range, and disclose the amount up to the high end of the range as an exposure to incremental loss, if such amount is considered reasonably possible. Such estimates are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability and record an adjustment to our estimate in the period in which the adjustment is probable and an amount or range can be reasonably estimated. The determination of an expected contingent liability and associated litigation expense requires the Company to make assumptions related to the outcome of these matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of loss contingencies, our estimates may be different than the actual outcomes.
