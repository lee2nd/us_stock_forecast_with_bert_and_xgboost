Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should read the sections titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Company Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize next-generation therapeutics for diseases representing significant unmet medical needs and burden to society, patients, and their families. Our current pipeline focuses on the central nervous system, respiratory, and metabolic diseases. We use a chemical genomics driven technology platform and proprietary chemistry to develop new medicines. Our pipeline currently has two drug candidates, RP5063 (Brilaroxazine) and RP1208. Both are new chemical entities discovered in-house. We have been granted composition of matter patents for both RP5063 and R1208 in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and several other countries.
Our lead drug candidate, RP5063, is ready for continued clinical development for multiple neuropsychiatric indications. These include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), behavioral and psychotic symptoms, dementia or Alzheimer’s disease (BPSD), Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Furthermore, RP5063 is also ready for clinical development for two respiratory indications - pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug designation to RP5063 for the treatment of PAH in November 2016 and IPF in April 2018.
Our primary focus is to complete the clinical development of RP5063 for the treatment of acute and maintenance schizophrenia.
Subject to the receipt of additional financing, we may also continue the clinical development of RP5063 for the treatment of BD, MDD, BPSD, PDP, ADHD, PAH and IPF. Moreover, subject to the receipt of additional financing, we may also advance the development of our second drug candidate, RP1208, for the treatment of depression and obesity.
Impact of COVID-19
In response to the spread of COVID-19, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees and community, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely and suspending all non-essential travel for our employees.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience disruptions that could adversely impact our business. The COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect clinical site initiation, patient recruitment and enrollment, patient dosing, distribution of drug to clinical sites and clinical trial monitoring for our clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively affect the operations of the third-party contract research organizations that we intend to rely upon to assist us in conducting our clinical trials and the contract manufacturers who manufacture our drug candidates.
We are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations. For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I-Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Combination and Domestication
On December 14, 2020, our predecessor company, formerly known as Tenzing Acquisition Corp., a British Virgin Islands exempted company (“Tenzing”), and Reviva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Old Reviva”), consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 20, 2020 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Tenzing, Tenzing Merger Subsidiary Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tenzing (“Merger Sub”), Old Reviva, and the other parties thereto. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Old Reviva, with Old Reviva surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. We refer to this transaction as the Business Combination. In connection with and one day prior to the completion of the Business Combination, Tenzing re-domiciled out of the British Virgin Islands and continued as a company incorporated in the State of Delaware, and changed its name to Reviva Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. Prior to the completion of the Business Combination, the Company was a shell company. Following the Business Combination, the business of Old Reviva is the business of the Company.
Old Reviva was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 1, 2006 and its subsidiary, Reviva Pharmaceuticals India Pvt. Ltd., was incorporated on December 23, 2014. Tenzing was formed pursuant to the laws of the British Virgin Islands on March 20, 2018.
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Tenzing was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on the holders of Old Reviva expecting to have a majority of the voting power of the post-combination company, Old Reviva senior management comprising substantially all of the senior management of the post-combination company, the relative size of Old Reviva compared to Tenzing, and Old Reviva operations comprising the ongoing operations of the post-combination company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination is treated as the equivalent of Old Reviva issuing stock for the net assets of Tenzing, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Tenzing were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of Old Reviva.
Financial Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. We have never been profitable, and our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 was $58.3 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.8 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and increased operating losses for the next several years. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities to research, develop and commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.
We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
●
invest significantly to further research and develop, through clinical trials for RP5063 (Brilaroxazine) and pre-clinical research for RP1208, and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates RP5063 (Brilaroxazine) and RP1208;
●
identify and develop additional product candidates;
●
hire additional clinical, scientific and management personnel;
●
seek regulatory and marketing approvals for any product candidates that we may develop;
●
ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval;
●
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
●
acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and
● 			
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product candidate development, any future commercialization efforts and our transition to a public company.
We have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our equity and convertible equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.8 million. To fund our current operating plans, we will need to raise additional capital. Our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient for us to complete development of our product candidates and, if applicable, to prepare for commercializing any product candidate that may receive approval. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial additional capital beyond our existing cash and cash equivalents to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities; however, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans through at least December 2021. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
Research and Development Expenses
We focus our resources on research and development activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies and product development and expenses such costs as they are incurred. We have not historically tracked or recorded research and development expenses on a project-by-project basis, primarily because we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects, and it is not practical for us to allocate such costs on a project-by-project basis. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses, including deferred salaries, salaries, benefits and taxes for personnel in research and development functions.
The largest recurring component of our total operating expenses has historically been research and development activities. we expect our research and development expenses will increase for the next several years as we advance our development programs, pursues regulatory approval of our product candidates in the U.S. and other jurisdictions and prepare for potential commercialization, which would require a significant investment in costs related to contract manufacturing, inventory buildup and sales and marketing activities.
Our primary product candidates and their current status is as follows:
Drug Candidate

RP5063
Schizophrenia
Phase 2 complete. We are currently focusing our efforts on initiating a pivotal Phase 3 study in acute schizophrenia.
RP5063

RP1208
Obesity
Completed pre-clinical development studies, including in vitro receptor binding studies and PK studies. Compound ready for animal efficacy studies.
** We completed the Phase 1 clinical study for RP5063 (Brilaroxazine) prior starting the Phase 2 study in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. We collected safety data for RP5063 (Brilaroxazine) in over 200 patients, including healthy subjects and patients with stable schizophrenia, acute schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Generally, no separate Phase 1 study is required for conducting a Phase 2 study for an additional indication, provided the treatment doses in the Phase 2 study for an additional indication are within the range of doses tested in the previously completed Phase 1 study.
The successful development of our platform and product candidates is highly uncertain, and we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our product candidates RP5063 (Brilaroxazine), RP1208, or any future product candidates. We estimate that initial costs to conduct our Phase 3 clinical study for RP5063 could total approximately $21.0 million, with approximately $7.0 million payable over the course of calendar 2021, and approximately $10.0 million payable during calendar 2022, and approximately $4.0 million payable during calendar 2023. At this time, other than our estimates for conducting our Phase 3 clinical study for RP5063, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing, or costs of the efforts necessary to finish developing any of our product candidates or the period in which material net cash, if any, from these product candidates may commence. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing therapeutics, including the uncertainty of:
●
the scope, rate of progress, expense, and results of clinical trials;
●
the scope, rate of progress, and expense of process development and manufacturing;
●
preclinical and other research activities; and
●
the timing of regulatory approvals.
General Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and related costs for employees in executive, business development, finance, and administrative functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include professional fees for accounting and legal services.
We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand infrastructure and continue the development of our clinical programs. Other increases could potentially include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, and increased fees for directors, outside consultants, lawyers, and accountants. We expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
Interest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense consisted primarily of interest associated with our promissory notes and beneficial conversion feature recognized on conversion of promissory notes.
Interest Income and Other Income
Interest income and other, net consists largely of interest earned on our cash & cash equivalents and gain recorded on issuance of common stock in lieu of salaries.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include stock-based compensation, beneficial conversion features, warrant values, and deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist stockholders and investors reading the consolidated financial statements in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
Research and development costs
Research and development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs include, but are not limited to, payroll and personnel expenses, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment depreciation, and utilities.
Income taxes
The Company utilizes FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
In evaluating the ability recover its deferred income tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including its opening results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The Company generated a deferred tax asset through net operating loss carry-forward. However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been established due to the uncertainty of the Company’s realization of the net operating loss carry forward prior to its expiration. In the event the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.
Fair Value Measurements of Warrants
ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:
●
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
●
Level 2 - Directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
●
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions.
In determining the fair value of warrants, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.
Beneficial Conversion Features
In accordance with FASB ASC 470-20, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options” the Company records a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) related to the issuance of convertible debt or preferred stock instruments that have conversion features at fixed rates that are in-the-money when issued. The BCF for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital. The intrinsic value is generally calculated at the commitment date as the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the common stock or other securities into which the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of shares into which the security is convertible. If certain other securities are issued with the convertible security, the proceeds are allocated among the different components. The portion of the proceeds allocated to the convertible security is divided by the contractual number of the conversion shares to determine the effective conversion price, which is used to measure the BCF. The effective conversion price is used to compute the intrinsic value. The value of the BCF is limited to the basis that is initially allocated to the convertible security.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The following table summarizes our results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research & Development expenses
We incurred approximately $295,000 and $196,000 in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary reason for the increase or $99,000, or 51%, was due to higher salary expenditures and increased consulting and drug development costs. Our research and development expenses are expected to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our platform and product candidates.
General Administrative Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred approximately $2.1 million and $181,000 in general and administrative expenses. The increase of $2.0 million, or 1,081%, was due to warrant expense of approximately $1,125,000, $345,000 attributable to the increased use of consultants in connection with accounting and legal activities and $444,000 in salary and related expenses for key personnel.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $1,453,000 and $470,000, respectively. The increase of $983,000, or 210%, in interest expense was due to the investor notes issued in 2020 and a beneficial conversion feature recognized on conversion of notes payable immediately prior to the Business Combination.
Interest & Other Income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash & cash equivalents and other income of $25,000 recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020, related to a non-refundable transaction payment made by Tenzing.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates; expand the scope of our current studies for our product candidates; initiate additional preclinical, clinical or other studies for our product candidates; change or add additional manufacturers or suppliers; seek regulatory and marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies; seek to identify, evaluate and validate additional product candidates; acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio; attract and retain skilled personnel; and experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.
Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings and collaboration agreements. We do not currently have any committed external sources of capital.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders.
If we raise additional funds through collaboration agreements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
The table below sets forth selected cash flow data for the periods presented:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.7 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $3.8 million and an increase in net operating assets of $2.3 million, offset by non-cash charges of $2.4 million. Non-cash charges largely related to change in fair value of warrant liability of $1.1 million, noncash interest expense related to beneficial conversion feature of $962,000 and issuance of common stock in lieu of deferred compensation of $341,000. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to decreases in the deferred costs and accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued interest.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $218,000, consisting primarily of a net loss of $847,000 and a decrease in net operating assets of $634,000. The decrease in net operating assets was due to increases in accounts payable, accrued interest and accrued expenses and other liabilities.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $12.5 million primarily related to proceeds of $9.4 million from the Business Combination and $3.1 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes.
Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 of $100,000 related to proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
As an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period. Accordingly, when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard, unless early adoption is permitted by the standard, and we elect early adoption. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
