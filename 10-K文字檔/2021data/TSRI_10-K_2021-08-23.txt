Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial information derived from the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. There can be no assurance that historical trends in operating results will continue in the future:
Revenue
Revenue consists primarily of revenue from computer programming consulting services. Revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 increased approximately $9,700,000 or 16.4% from the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, primarily due to new business development and the acquisition of Geneva. Excluding the added business activity of $8,805,000 from the Geneva client base, revenue would have increased $895,000 or 1.5%. The average number of consultants on billing with customers increased from 416 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 to 479 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. There were 308 and 335 IT contractors at May 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively; while there were 108 and 144 clerical and administrative contractors at May 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
We experienced terminated assignments and a decrease in demand for new assignments during fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the lower number of consultant placements during the year and negatively impacted the Company’s revenues. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has created operational challenges. The start of certain new assignments has been and continues to be delayed due to delays in obtaining necessary clearances, as many of the agencies required to be contacted in obtaining the information needed for background checks have been fully or partially closed. By the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company had used 100% of the $6,659,000 proceeds from the PPP Loan (as defined in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report) it received in April 2020 to fund its payroll and other allowable expenses, which was fully forgiven in July 2021. The use of these proceeds allowed the Company to avoid certain salary reductions, furloughs and layoffs of employees during the covered period.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 increased approximately $7,557,000 or 15.1% to $57,500,000 from $49,943,000 in the prior year period. The increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from an increase in consultants placed with customers, primarily from the new business development activity within the existing Geneva client base. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from 84.5% in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 to 83.6% in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The percentage increase in cost of sales for the fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 (15.1% increase) was lower than the percentage increase in revenue for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 (16.4% increase), causing an increase in gross margins.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses relating to account executives, technical recruiters, facilities costs, management and corporate overhead. These expenses increased approximately $880,000 or 8.1% from $10,929,000 in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 to $11,809,000 in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The increase in these expenses primarily resulted from an additional $1,721,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses from the newly acquired Geneva operation offset by a decrease of $868,000 in amounts paid for legal and advisory services from the prior year related to the Stockholder Litigation and costs surrounding the prior year proxy and annual meeting. Additionally, the Company incurred non-cash compensation expenses of $236,000 in fiscal 2021 related to the TSR, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and also recorded an asset impairment charge of $137,000 in fiscal 2021 due to the signing of a subletting agreement for one of its offices. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 18.5% in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 to 17.1% in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021.
Other Expense
Other expense for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 resulted primarily from net interest expense of approximately $193,000 and a mark to market loss of approximately $5,000 on the Company’s marketable equity securities. Other expense for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 resulted primarily from net interest expense of $75,000 and a mark to market gain of approximately $15,000 on the Company’s marketable equity securities.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates were a benefit of 15.9% for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 and a benefit of 39.3% for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. In the prior fiscal year, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) allowed net operating losses to be carried back five years. The Company applied for refunds of approximately $586,000 based on the fiscal 2019 loss. The deferred tax asset provided from the loss in fiscal 2019 was originally recorded at the lower federal rate of 21%. It was used in fiscal 2020 at the higher federal rate of 34% used prior to 2018, resulting in an additional benefit in excess of $200,000. The rates for both years consist of the new federal corporate tax rate of 21.0% effective January 1, 2018. The benefit of the deferred tax asset will be limited to 21% for federal income tax purposes in fiscal years going forward.
Net Loss Attributable to TSR
Net loss attributable to TSR was approximately $601,000 in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 compared to a loss of $1,126,000 in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. The decrease in the net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue and gross profit from the Geneva acquisition and a decrease in legal and advisory fees.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, inflation and changing prices did not have a material effect on the Company’s revenue or income from continuing operations.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Changes in Financial Condition
The Company’s cash was sufficient to enable it to meet its liquidity requirements during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents and the Company’s revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement with Access Capital, Inc. (the “Lender”)will be sufficient to provide the Company with adequate resources to meet its liquidity requirements for the 12 month period following the issuance of these financial statements. Utilizing its accounts receivable as collateral, the Company has secured the Credit Facility to increase its liquidity as necessary. As of May 31, 2021, the net borrowings outstanding against this Credit Facility were approximately $93,000. The amount the Company has borrowed fluctuates and, at times, it has utilized the maximum amount of $2,000,000 available under this facility in the prior fiscal year to fund its payroll and other obligations. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of May 31, 2021 and through the date of this filing. Additionally, in April 2020, the Company secured a PPP Loan in the amount of $6,659,000 to meet its obligations in the face of potential disruptions in its business operations and the potential inability of its customers to pay their accounts when due. As of August 31, 2020, the Company had used 100% of the PPP Loan funds to fund its payroll and for other allowable expenses under the PPP Loan. The use of these funds allowed the Company to avoid certain salary reductions, furloughs and layoffs of employees during the period. The Company applied for PPP Loan forgiveness and subsequent to the end of the reporting period, the application for forgiveness was accepted and approved; the PPP Loan was fully forgiven in July 2021.
At May 31, 2021, the Company had working capital (total current assets in excess of total current liabilities) of approximately $8,898,000 including cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $7,416,000 as compared to working capital of $12,239,000 including cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $9,780,000 at May 31, 2020.
Net cash flow of approximately $1,304,000 was provided by operations during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 as compared to $1,567,000 of net cash flow used in operations in the prior year. The cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in accounts payable and other payables and accrued expenses of $2,798,000 and a decrease in prepaid and recoverable income taxes of $590,000 offset by the consolidated net loss of $577,000 and an increase in accounts receivable of $1,824,000. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily resulted from the deferral of $1,269,000 in payroll taxes as allowed by the CARES Act. One half of these deferred payroll taxes are due December 31, 2021 and the second half on December 31, 2022. The cash used in operations for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 primarily resulted from the consolidated net loss of $1,098,000, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $892,000 and an increase in prepaid and recoverable income taxes of $547,000, which were offset, to an extent, by a decrease in accounts receivable of $386,000 and the accrual of $828,000 for a legal settlement.
Net cash used in investing activities of approximately $3,226,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 primarily resulted from the acquisition of Geneva in the amount of $3,100,000 and purchases of fixed assets of $126,000. Net cash provided by investing activities of $471,000 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 primarily resulted from not reinvesting the proceeds of matured certificates of deposit of $492,000 offset, to an extent, by purchases of fixed assets of $21,000.
Net cash used in financing activities of approximately $437,000 during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 resulted from net payments on the Company’s Credit Facility of $409,000 and distributions to the minority interest of $28,000. Net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 of $7,132,000 primarily resulted from proceeds from the PPP Loan of $6,659,220 and net drawings under the Company’s Credit Facility of $501,000.
The Company’s capital resource commitments at May 31, 2021 consisted of lease obligations on its branch and corporate facilities and an accrued legal settlement payable. The net present value of its future lease and settlement payments were approximately $1,017,000 and $867,000, respectively, as of May 31, 2021. The Company intends to finance these commitments primarily from the Company’s available cash and Credit Facility.
Impact of New Accounting Standards
Effective June 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases, which sets out the principle for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. An accounting policy election may be made to account for leases with a term of 12 months or less similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the existing guidance on accounting for leases. In July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows for an optional transition method for the adoption of Topic 842. The two permitted transition methods are now the modified retrospective approach, which applies the new lease requirements at the beginning of the earliest period presented, and the optional transition method, which applies the new lease requirements through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. ASU 2016-02 is effective for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 and the interim periods within that year. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the optional transition method. The Company also elected the practical expedients that allow us to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company has established an inventory of existing leases and implemented a new process of evaluating the classification of each lease. The financial impact of the adoption of the new standard at June 1, 2019 increased total assets and total liabilities by approximately $690,000. The financial impact of the adoption primarily relates to the capitalization of right-of-use assets and recognition of lease liabilities related to operating leases.
Critical Accounting Policies
The SEC defines “critical accounting policies” as those that require the application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to its consolidated financial statements, contained elsewhere in this report. The Company believes that the following accounting policies require the application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized as control of the promised service is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for the services. Revenues from contract assignments are recognized over time, based on hours worked by the Company’s contract professionals. The performance of the requested service over time is the single performance obligation for assignment revenues. Certain customers may receive discounts (e.g., volume discounts, rebates, prompt-pay discounts) and adjustments to the amounts billed. These discounts, rebates and adjustments are considered variable consideration. Volume discounts are the largest component of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely amount method prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, contracts terms and estimates of revenue. Revenues are recognized net of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenues will not occur in subsequent periods. Payment terms vary and the time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. There are no financing components to the Company’s arrangements. There are no incremental costs to obtain contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are expensed as incurred. The Company’s operations are primarily located in the United States. The Company recognizes most of its revenue on a gross basis when it acts as a principal in its transactions. The Company has direct contractual relationships with its customers, bears the risks and rewards of its arrangements, and has the discretion to select the contract professionals and establish the price for the services to be provided. Additionally, the Company retains control over its contract professionals based on its contractual arrangements. The Company primarily provides services through its employees and to a lesser extent, through subcontractors; the related costs are included in cost of sales. The Company includes billable expenses (out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses) in revenue and the associated expenses are included in cost of sales.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets
We regularly evaluate our ability to recover the reported amount of our deferred income tax assets considering several factors, including our estimate of the likelihood of the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years during the period over which temporary differences reverse. Presently, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets based primarily on the Company’s history of and projections for taxable income in the future. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance against a portion or all of our deferred tax assets, which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment analysis at least once annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a unit is greater than its fair value.
Intangible Assets
The Company amortizes its intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and will review these assets for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
