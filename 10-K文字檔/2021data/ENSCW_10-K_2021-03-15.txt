The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements.

Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated on September 11, 2017 in Delaware and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Units under the Contingent Forward Purchase Contract, if any (which has been waived in connection with the Business Combination with Ensysce), our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
We are incurring significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful.
Recent Developments
On November 26, 2019, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders at which our stockholders approved extending our Combination Period deadline from December 5, 2019 to April 5, 2020 (the “First Extension”). Our public stockholders were able to elect to redeem their shares in connection with the First Extension for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account ($10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay franchise and income taxes). With respect to public shares not redeemed in connection with the Special Meeting, we agreed to make Contributions of $0.03 for each public share that was not redeemed by stockholders for each of the four monthly periods covered by the extension (commencing on December 6, 2019 through the end of the First Extension), subject to certain conditions. The number of shares of redeemed by public stockholders in connection with the First Extension was 1,123,749 for an aggregate cash redemption amount of $11,583,473.
On December 5, 2019, the Company entered into the Expense Advancement Agreement with GTWY Holdings pursuant to which GTWY Holdings committed to provide $566,288 to fund Contributions to the Trust Account, representing the amount needed to fund the first monthly Contribution during the First Extension. The Company drew down the full amount under the Expense Advancement Agreement to fund the required Contribution to the Trust Account for the period December 6, 2019 to January 5, 2020 by issuing an unsecured promissory note to GTWY Holdings. The note does not bear interest. If we complete our initial business combination, the amount borrowed under the Expense Advancement Agreement would be repaid out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to it. Otherwise, amounts borrowed under the Expense Advancement Agreement would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. Amounts borrowed pursuant to the Expense Advancement Agreement were deposited to the Trust Account on December 6, 2019. The note was converted into warrants on January 31, 2021 at a price of $1.00 per warrant and subject to the same terms and conditions as our private placement warrants.
On January 6, 2020, the Company deposited $566,288 to the Trust Account to fund the required Contribution to the Trust Account for the period January 6, 2020 to February 5, 2020.
On January 15, 2020, we drew down $1,000,000 under the Expense Advancement Agreement with our sponsors and strategic investor dated December 1, 2017 to fund general corporate purposes in exchange for issuing unsecured promissory notes. The holders had the option to convert the promissory notes into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant subject to the same terms and conditions as private placement warrants. The notes were converted into warrants on June 25, 2020. Notes issued under the Expense Advancement Agreement do not bear interest. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay amounts borrowed under the Expense Advancement Agreement out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to it; provided, however, that the sponsors and strategic investor have the option to convert promissory notes into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant subject to the same terms and conditions as our private placement warrants. Otherwise, amounts borrowed under the Expense Advancement Agreement would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. The expense advancement agreement was amended to increase the total amount of advances available to us under the agreement by $125,000 on June 29, 2020 and by an additional $75,000 on October 26, 2020 and an additional $100,000 on November 30, 2020, for a total of $300,000, of which we drew down $225,000 pursuant to promissory notes issued in October and November 2020, with a resulting balance of $225,000 under the promissory notes as of December 31, 2020. On February 23, 2021, we entered into the Fourth Expense Advancement Amendment to the Expense Advancement Agreement to increase the total amount of advances available to the Company under the agreement to $1,460,000. The November 2020 Promissory Notes were amended and restated on February 24, 2021 in order to reflect the incremental increase of the total amount of advances available to the Company thereunder to $460,000 from $300,000 and all of such increase was drawn on February 24, 2021.
On each of February 4, 2020 and March 4, 2020, we deposited $566,288 into the Trust Account to fund the required Contribution to the Trust Account for the remaining monthly periods covered by the Extension.
On March 26, 2020, we held a special meeting pursuant to which our stockholders approved extending the Combination Period from April 5, 2020 to June 30, 2020 (the “Second Extension Date”). In connection with the approval of the extension, stockholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 16,837,678 shares of our common stock. As a result, an aggregate of $176,283,492 (or approximately $10.47 per share) was released from our Trust Account to pay such stockholders. Of the amount paid to redeeming stockholders, $136,283,492 was paid as of March 31, 2020 and the balance of $40,000,000 was paid on April 1, 2020.
On June 26, 2020, we held a special meeting pursuant to which our stockholders approved extending the Combination Period from June 30, 2020 to December 1, 2020 (the “Third Extension Date”). In connection with the approval of the extension, stockholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 776,290 shares of our common stock. As a result, an aggregate of $8,099,292 (or approximately $10.43 per share) was released from our Trust Account to pay such stockholders.
On July 16, 2020, we elected to terminate the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 27, 2019 (the “GTWY Merger Agreement”), with GTWY Holdings, and a related subsidiary, GTWY Merger Sub Corp. Pursuant to its terms, we had the ability to terminate the GTWY Merger Agreement to the extent the business combination had not been completed by July 15, 2020.
On November 24, 2020, our stockholders approved extending the Combination Period from December 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 (the “Fourth Extension Date”). In connection with the approval of the extension, stockholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 38,015 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, an aggregate of $393,380 (or approximately $10.34 per share) was released from our Trust Account to pay such stockholders, and we have 6,224,268 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 15, 2021.
NASDAQ Notice
On November 30, 2020, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that we were not in compliance with Listing Rule IM-5101-2 (the “Rule”), which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with its initial public offering, and that we were also not in compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum publicly held shares requirement under Listing Rule 5550(a)(4), which requires a listed company’s primary equity security to maintain a minimum of 500,000 publicly held shares.
On January 27, 2021, the Panel granted our request for continued listing of our equity securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to an extension, subject to certain milestones, through June 1, 2021. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - The Nasdaq may not continue to list our securities, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions”.
Merger Agreement
On January 31, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Ensysce and Merger Sub, relating to a proposed business combination transaction between us and Ensysce.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Ensysce, with Ensysce surviving such merger as our wholly owned subsidiary and the stockholders of Ensysce becoming our stockholders (the “Merger”).
Ensysce’s issued and outstanding share of common stock as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger (including shares issuable on conversion of convertible notes of Ensysce). will, at the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (collectively, the “Transaction”), be canceled and converted into the right to receive our common stock, calculated based on an exchange ratio of 0.06585 (the “Exchange Ratio”).
The Transaction will be consummated subject to the deliverables and provisions as further described in the Merger Agreement.
We are incurring significant costs in the pursuit of its acquisition plans. We may be required to seek additional resources in the future to fund general corporate purposes and cannot assure you that our plans to complete the Transactions will be successful.
Results of Operations
Our only activities from inception through December 31, 2020 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target for our Business Combination and seeking to complete an initial business combination, including activities in connection with the proposed acquisition of Ensysce and the announced and subsequently terminated acquisition of GTWY Holdings. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence and transaction expenses in connection with completing a Business Combination.
For year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net income of $2,404,519, which consists interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $719,646 and the forgiveness of accounts payable of $3,298,207, offset by operating costs of $1,368,841 and a provision for income taxes of $244,493.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had net income of $365,954, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $4,249,828 offset by operating costs of $3,328,674 and a provision for income taxes of $555,200.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $12,628,170 (including approximately $239,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income on the Trust Account will be used by us to pay franchise and income taxes. Through December 31, 2020, we withdrew $2,001,144 of interest earned on the Trust Account to pay franchise and income taxes, of which $326,352 was withdrawn during the year ended December 31, 2020.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less deferred underwriting commissions and interest income that is used to pay franchise and income taxes) to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $49,202 held outside the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination, and we have also used such funds to make Contributions to the Trust Account in connection with the First Extension (see “Recent Developments” above).
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $864,439. Net income of $2,404,519 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $719,646 and the forgiveness of accounts payable in the amount of $3,298,207. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $748,895 of cash from operating activities.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $1,424,792. Net income of $365,954 was offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $4,249,828 and a deferred tax benefit of $1,764. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $2,460,846 of cash from operating activities.
On December 5, 2019, the Company entered into the Expense Advancement Agreement with GTWY Holdings pursuant to which GTWY Holdings committed to provide $566,288 to fund Contributions to the Trust Account. representing the amount needed to fund the first monthly Contribution during the First Extension. The Company drew down the full amount under the Expense Advancement Agreement to fund the required Contribution to the Trust Account for the period December 6, 2019 to January 5, 2020 by issuing an unsecured promissory note to GTWY Holdings (the “GTWY Promissory Note”). The GTWY Promissory Note does not bear interest. Amounts borrowed pursuant to the Expense Advancement Agreement were deposited to the Trust Account on December 6, 2019. On January 31, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the GTWY Promissory Note to permit conversion of all or a portion of the GTWY Promissory Note into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. In connection with such amendment, GTWY Holdings elected to convert the full principal balance of the GTWY Promissory Note into 566,288 warrants.
On December 1, 2017, HG Vora entered into a Contingent Forward Purchase Contract with us to purchase, in a private placement for gross proceeds of $62,500,000 to occur concurrently with the consummation of our Business Combination, 6,250,000 Units on the same terms as the sale of Units in the Initial Public Offering at $10.00 per unit. The funds from the sale of the Private Placement Units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the Business Combination; any excess funds from the Private Placement Units may be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. This commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their shares and provides us with an increased minimum funding level for the Business Combination. HG Vora’s obligation to purchase our Units under the Contingent Forward Purchase contract is contingent upon, among other things, HG Vora approving the Business Combination, which approval can be withheld for any reason. In connection with previously proposed business combination transaction with GTWY Holdings, an amendment to the Contingent Forward Purchase Contract was effected on December 27, 2019 to provide that the Contingent Forward Purchase Contract would terminate as of, and contingent upon, the closing of the transaction with GTWY Holdings such that the strategic investor would instead purchase 3,000,000 units of GTWY Holdings’ equity securities (with each unit consisting of one GTWY Holdings Share and one-half of one GTWY Holdings Warrant) for a purchase price of $10.00 per unit. In addition, HG Vora waived its rights under the Contingent Forward Purchase Contract to purchase Private Placement Units in connection with the proposed Merger with Ensysce.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Hydra Sponsor, an affiliate of the Matthews Lane Sponsor and HG Vora (the “Funding Parties”) loaned an aggregate of $1,000,000 to the Company, in accordance with unsecured promissory notes issued on January 15, 2020 to the Funding Parties, pursuant to an expense advance agreement dated December 1, 2017 which were subsequently converted by the holders into warrants on June 25, 2020. The expense advancement agreement was amended to increase the total amount of advances available to the Company under the agreement by an additional $300,000 pursuant to amendments effected through November 30, 2020, of which the Company drew down an aggregate of $225,000 through December 31, 2020. The agreement was further amended on February 23, 2021 to increase the total amount of advances available to the Company by an additional $160,000 which was drawn down, on February 24, 2021, resulting in aggregate loans outstanding of $460,000 at March 10, 2021. The Funding Parties may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company additional funds from time to time or at any time, as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Under the expense advancement agreement, Working Capital Loans would either be paid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, could be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2020, there were $225,000 amounts outstanding under the Working Capital Loans (the $1,000,000 previously loaned by the Funding Parties having been converted into warrants on June 25, 2020).
As of December 31, 2020, we had $49,202 in our operating bank accounts, $12,628,170 in securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its common stock in connection therewith and working capital deficit of $127,869, which excludes $93,929 of prepaid income and franchise taxes.
We will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsors, HG Vora, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Our sponsors and HG Vora may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet our working capital needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through June 30, 2021, the date that we will be required to cease all operations, except for the purpose of winding up, if a Business Combination is not consummated. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, we do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement dated December 1, 2017 to pay our Hydra sponsor a monthly fee of up to $10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support provided to us until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. We began incurring these fees on December 1, 2017. Effective September 30, 2020, Hydra Sponsor agreed to stop charging the Company the monthly administrative fee and forgave the $71,000 outstanding balance due under the agreement.
The underwriters are entitled to underwriting discounts and commissions of 5.5%, of which 2.0% ($4,000,000) was paid at the closing of the Initial Public Offering, and 3.5% ($7,000,000) was deferred. The deferred discount will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriters are not entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount. On November 23, 2020, the underwriters agreed to waive $250,000 of the deferred fee that is to be paid upon consummation of the Business Combination, as a result of which $6,750,000 remained payable. On January 31, 2021, the underwriters agreed to reduce the total deferred underwriting fee that is to be paid to such underwriters upon the consummation of our Business Combination to $2,000,000, which have the right, under certain situations, to pay in the form of our common stock.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets.
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account, net of applicable taxes, if any, by the weighted average number of shares of redeemable common stock outstanding for the period. Net loss per common share, basic and diluted for non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing net income less income attributable to redeemable common stock, by the weighted average number of shares of non-redeemable common stock outstanding for the period presented.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
