Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Results of Operations
On November 16, 2020 Healthtech Solutions, Inc. acquired all of the capital stock of Medi-Scan, Inc. in exchange for Series A Preferred Stock representing 97% of the equity in Healthtech Solutions. Because the transaction is classified as a reverse merger under GAAP, the financial results presented in this Report are the financial results of Medi-Scan for the past two years. Medi-Scan is in its pre-revenue period, and will remain so until it obtains approval to market its medical device from the U.S. FDA or the comparable agency of the European Union.
Since our only activities are research and development, our expenses are primarily salaries and consulting and service fees. During 2020 we paid $348,773 for research and development, most of which was payment to consultants working under the direction of our Chief Research Officer ("CRO") as well as payments to outside labs and clinics for services. In addition, we paid $77,060 during 2020 to the Chief Research Officer of Medi-Scan for his services and in reimbursement of expenses. During 2019, our payments for research and development and to our CRO were $206,441 and $113,100 respectively. We expect that our research and development expenses will rise significantly if we obtain the capital resources necessary to fully implement our business plan.
The remainder of our operating expenses were primarily attributable to administrative costs. We incurred $115,403 in general administrative expenses during 2020 and $71,101 during 2019. These included office expenses plus legal and accounting fees. In addition, we paid $129,733 in 2020 and $119,137 in 2019 to related parties for administrative expenses. These included:
· Rental fees of $1,447 per month that we paid to a member of our Board to rent space in his law firm's offices through May 2020; we now obtain use of that office space as well as office space in our CEO's premises free-of-charge. Therefore our rent expense during 2020 was only $7,233, compared to rent expense of $17,137 in 2019.
· Expenses of $10,000 per month that we have incurred since May 2020 for the consulting services of our COO.
· Payments until May 2020 for legal services provided by a member of our Board of Directors, and miscellaneous office expenses, including payments for an administrative assistant.
· Expenses accrued for administrative services provided by certain employees of a company owned by our CEO, which were credited to his commitment to contribute capital to Medi-Scan.
We also incur $3,241 per month in amortization costs, as we are amortizing over a three year period the intangible assets that our Chief Research Officer contributed to Medi-Scan.
As a result of the aforesaid expenses, in 2020 we incurred a net loss from operations of $709,858. In 2019, our net loss from operations was $548,668. In 2020, however, we also incurred two items of Other Expense:
· $19,577 in interest expense (primarily attributable to the 7% Convertible Debentures and the 7% Notes that were exchanged for them); and
· $2,773 in loss in the change of fair value of derivative liabilities, relating to the 7% Convertible Debentures.
We accounted for our convertible debt in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging as the conversion feature embedded in the convertible debentures could result in the debenture principal and related accrued interest being converted to a variable number of our common shares. The conversion feature on these debentures is variable and based on trailing market prices. It therefore contains an embedded derivative. The fair value of the conversion feature was calculated when the debentures were issued, and we recorded a debenture discount and derivative liability for the calculated value. We recognize interest expense for accretion of the debenture discount over the term of the note. The conversion liability will be valued at the end of each reporting period and will result in a gain or loss for the change in fair value. Due to the volatile nature of our stock, the change in the derivative liability and the resulting gain or loss may often be material to our results. The discounted principal amount on our convertible debentures was $305,684 as of December 31, 2020, and the unamortized discount was $337,874. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a loss of $2,773 for the change in fair value of the derivative was recognized for these debentures.
After taking into account our Other Expenses in 2020, our net loss for 2020 was $732,208 ($0.61 per share). During 2019 we incurred a net loss of $548,668.
We will continue to incur losses until we begin to generate revenues at a level adequate to sustain our operations without cash infusion.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At that start of 2020 Medi-Scan had $105,754 in cash, and had accounts payable totaling $36,400, for working capital of $69,354. During 2020, however, our operations used $531,446 in cash, primarily for research and development. That expenditure was financed by a capital contribution of $270,442, primarily by our CEO, and the sale of Debentures. In August and September Medi-Scan sold four 7% Exchangeable Notes for total proceeds of $375,000 and in December Healthtech Solutions sold four 7% Convertible Notes for total proceeds of $250,000, and so the Company was able to fund its operations. Nevertheless, it is obvious that Healthtech Solutions will have to obtain substantial capital infusions in order to fund the continuing development of Medi-Scan's technology and the costs of securing the necessary governmental approvals.
Until the sale of its 7% Exchangeable Notes (which were later exchanged for 7% Convertible Debentures issued by Healthtech Solutions), Medi-Scan had financed its operations from capital contributions of the shareholders. For the sake of efficiency, the capital contributions were held in a bank account maintained by one of the members of management. The funds in that account are identified on Medi-Scan's financial statements as "due from related party." For purpose of analysis, those funds can be considered to be cash.
At December 31, 2020 Healthtech Solutions had working capital totaling $55,036, primarily consisting of cash. This represented a reduction of $14,318 from the Company's working capital at the end of 2019. Our working capital balance remained relatively stable because our net cash used in operating activities plus the cash used in 2020 that had been classified at December 31, 2019 as "Due From Related Party" plus the cash used in connection with the reverse merger was only $23,242 less than the net cash provided by financing activities during 2020.
In both 2020 and 2019, our net loss was substantially equal to our use of cash, treating the capital contributions held in the Due from Related Party account as cash. The only significant non-cash expenses incurred by Medi-Scan are its amortization expense of $38,889 per year, as we are amortizing our intangible assets over a three year life. The only other way in which the Company avoided taking the full brunt of its net losses in its cash account was to increase its accounts payable during 2020 by $43,769 and 2019 by $20,404 and accruing $3,792 in interest on the 7% Convertible Debentures during the last seven weeks of 2020.
At the present time, Healthtech Solutions has only two individuals working on a full-time basis: our Chief Operating Officer and Medi-Scan's Chief Research Officer. The seven other individuals who provide services to Medi-Scan at this time do so on an hourly, as needed basis. We have some ability, therefore, to adjust our cash burn rate to our resources. Nevertheless, the task of bringing a complex medical device to market is an expensive task. We will require millions of dollars to accomplish it.
Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements discloses that the financial condition of Healthtech Solutions - i.e. our modest cash resources and the absence of revenue - raises substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management intends to pursue one or more offerings of securities in order to obtain the funds that will be necessary for successful implementation of our business plan. At present, however, no commitments for future funding have been received.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing our financial statements we are required to formulate working policies regarding valuation of our assets and liabilities and to develop estimates of those values. In our preparation of the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were two estimates made which were (a) subject to a high degree of uncertainty and (b) material to our results. These were:
· Our determination of the fair value of the derivative liability embedded in the 7% Convertible Debentures that we sold during 2020. We based the determination of fair value on certain assumptions specified in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
· Our determination to amortize our intangible assets over a useful like of three years, as described in Note 4 to our financial statements. We based that amortization schedule on our expectation that the technology in our field will develop rapidly.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Impact of Accounting Pronouncements
There were no recent accounting pronouncements that have or will have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial position or results of operations.
