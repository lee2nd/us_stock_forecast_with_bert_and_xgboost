Presentation of Information
As used in this prospectus, the terms “we,” “us” “our” and the “Company” mean Cosmos Holdings Inc. unless the context requires otherwise. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited (and unaudited) financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this prospectus. All dollar amounts in this registration statement refer to U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.
Overview
On September 27, 2013, the Company closed a reverse take-over transaction pursuant to which it acquired a private company whose principal activities are the trading of products, providing representation, and provision of consulting services to various industries. Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Amplerissimo Ltd. (“Amplerissimo”), a company incorporated in Cyprus, we acquired 100% of Amplerissimo’s issued and outstanding common stock. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc. and changed our focus and business strategy to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.
The Company, through its subsidiaries, is operating within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.
We are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of our subsidiaries, SkyPharm (Greece) and Decahedron (UK), in order to become an international pharmaceutical company. The Company’s focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Food Supplements and targets areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company has already created its own line of vitamins and food supplement products under the brand name Sky Life Premium and targets areas where it can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on acquisitions of established companies and our ability to maintain better pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are designed to enable the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create added value for our shareholders. In particular, we look to enhance our pharmaceutical and over-the-counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective company acquisition opportunities.
On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with certain institutional investors (the “Buyers”) with which it had no prior relationship, pursuant to which the Company issued for a purchase price of $3,000,000, $3,350,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes (the “Notes”) to the Buyers, convertible into 670,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) at $5.00 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 536,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at $7.50 per share (the “Warrants”.)
On August 25, 2017, we received shareholder and board approval for a reverse stock split of our common stock on the basis of issuing one (1) share of common stock in exchange for each ten (10) shares of common stock issued and outstanding. On November 21, 2017, the reverse stock split was made affective by FINRA. On November 21, 2017, the Company effected a one-for-ten (1:10) reverse stock split whereby the Company decreased, by a ratio of one-for-ten (1:10) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Proportionate adjustments for the reverse stock split were made to the Company’s outstanding stock options, and warrants including all share and per-share data, for all amounts and periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. All share and per share date in this Report gave retroactive effect to the reverse stock split unless otherwise noted.
On September 4, 2018, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) and completed the financing with two institutional investors who had previously purchased $3,350,000 principal amount of senior convertible notes in November 2017 (the “November Notes”) as amended in February 2018 and September 2018. The Company issued, for a $2,000,000 purchase price, $2,233,333 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes (the “Notes”) convertible into 372,223 shares of Common Stock at $6.00 per share and five-year Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,334 shares of common stock exercisable at $7.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $1,845,000 after deduction of offering costs. See “Debt Obligations - Senior Convertible Notes” below.
On December 19, 2018, the Company completed the purchase of all capital stock of Cosmofarm Ltd., a pharmaceutical wholesaler based in Athens, Greece. The principal of the selling shareholder is Panagiotis Kozaris, who remained with Cosmofarm as a director and chief operating officer once it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Grigorios Siokas, the Company’s CEO, became the new CEO of Cosmofarm. Mr. Kozaris had no prior relationship to the Company other than as an independent shareholder. The purchase price payable is €200,000 evidenced by a promissory note. Closing of the acquisition was subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, delivery of audited and interim financial statements of Cosmofarm subject to being audited by PCAOB auditors, no material adverse change in the business or financial condition of Cosmofarm, all necessary consents and approvals to complete the acquisition have been obtained and other customary closing conditions.
Cosmofarm’s primary activity as a pharmaceutical wholesaler is the distribution of pharmaceuticals (mainly prescription), OTC products and nutraceuticals to a growing network of over 320 pharmacies and 14 wholesalers primarily located in the greater Athens, Greece region. To boost cost-efficiency and better facilitate its growing operations, the Company t relocated to a larger building in March 2019. Cosmofarm also seeks to expand its current operations automation investments by acquiring fully-integrated order management systems and additional robotic logistics over equipment.
The Effects of COVID-19 on Our 2020 Operations
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on January 30, 2020. Since the outbreak in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has expanded its impact to Europe, where all of our operations reside as well as our employees, suppliers and customers. To date, our operations have been affected by the following adverse risks:
Adverse Risks
· Drug shortages due to ban of exports
· Problems/restrictions in supply chain
· Logistics delays
· Restrictions on employees’ ability to work
· Liquidity issues (AR/AP) - payment delays and new government regulations for freezing payment terms
· National or EU long lasting recession
Subsequent to year-end, management has identified opportunities as listed below, that could balance, at least in part, the adverse effects of COVID-19 during the fiscal year-end 2020. However, there can be no assurance that this will occur prior to a vaccine and treatment becoming effective.
Opportunities
· Sales increase of OTC products branded
· Sales increase of food supplements (Vitamin D3, Vitamin C, multivitamins)
· Sales increase of antibacterial products and medicine masks
· Obtain exclusive distribution rights for detection test kits for COVID-19
· Governmental financing incentives related to liquidity
· VAT incentives (in the UK the VAT of imports is waived on medical products)
Management’s Expectations
Management believes that there could be a positive long-term outcome, which could result in an increase in sales of OTC branded products, food supplements, antibacterial products and medical masks. However, there is no guarantee of such results. Therefore, we will increase R&D as we are aiming to innovate and create new products in order to help combat against COVID-19. We have adapted our strategy in response to COVID-19 and will continue to do so, since we are expecting the impact of COVID-19 to continue for the next 18-24 months.
What Effect Will COVID-19 Have on the Company’s Disclosure Controls
Management does not believe COVID-19 will have a significant effect on our disclosure controls as there have been no changes to date. Our operations have continued at a normal pace, at least 90% of our staff continue to work on site and those staff who are working remotely have no impact on our disclosure controls.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2020 versus December 31, 2019
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had net income of $820,786 on revenue of $55,406,337, versus a net loss of $3,298,965 on revenue of $39,676,385, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Revenue
Revenue during the Company’s twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, increased by 40% as compared to revenues in the period ended December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly because of the increase of sales and by expanding the portfolio of our own branded products Sky Life Premium, which continued the expansion of point sales even more aggressively during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions in the member states of European Union, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in government rules and regulations.
Cost of Goods Sold
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had direct costs of goods sold of $47,345,957 associated to cost of goods sold versus $36,014,116 from the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of goods sold year over year increased by 31% in 2020 as compared to 2019 due directly to the increase in revenue.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8,060,380 compared with the $3,662,269 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit increased by $4,398,111 or 120% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit was primarily due to the increase of Company’s main revenue source of trading, sourcing and distribution of pharmaceutical products, as well as the increase in sales of our own brand of nutraceuticals; SkyPremium Life.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had general and administrative costs of $5,346,087, sales and marketing expenses of $763,170 and depreciation and amortization expense of $397,595 for a net operating profit of $2,835,777. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had general and administrative costs of $3,523,450, depreciation and amortization expense of $394,628, for a net operating loss of $255,809.
The approximate 36% increase in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020, versus the prior year ended, is primarily due to sales and marketing expenses for launching our own branded nutraceuticals. Also, there is an increase of the payroll due to new Salesforce team and third-party services.
Interest Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had interest expense of $2,761,004 and non-cash interest expenses of $34,106 related to the fair value of warrants for services, extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount versus the year ending December 31, 2019 where we had interest expense of $1,412,465, non-cash interest expenses of $320,205 related to the fair value of warrants for services, extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt discount and $264 of interest related to loans from related parties.
Unrealized Foreign Currency Losses
Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency translation income of $875,235 for the year ended December 31, 2020 such that our net comprehensive income for the period was $1,692,021 versus the unrealized foreign currency loss of $49,167 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $3,348,132 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase relates to the increase in intercompany loans from the parent related to capital raises and the volatility/fluctuation from the prior year of the Euro to USD exchange.
Going Concern
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had net income of $820,786, net cash used in operations of $11,501,718, working capital of $5,979,870 and had an accumulated deficit of $18,750,824 as of December 31, 2020. During the fiscal year, the Company has undergone a strategic review process to help find a definitive solution to the Company’s accumulated deficit constraints. Options under consideration in the strategic review process include, but are not limited to, securing new debt, exchange debt for equity, restructuring current debt facilities from short term into long-term making the proper actions for new fund raising. The Company has adequate cash from operations in order to cover its operating costs and to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months due to Covid-19 pandemic.
In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $5,979,870 versus a working capital deficit of $7,062,250 as of December 31, 2019. This increase in the working capital surplus is primarily attributed to the Company’s operating profit in the year ending as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had net cash of $628,395 versus $38,537 as of December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $11,501,718 versus $4,788,842 net cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The Company has devoted substantially all of its cash resources to apply its investment program to expand through organic business growth and, where appropriate, the execution on selective company and license acquisitions, and incurred significant general and administrative expenses to enable it to finance and grow its business and operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was $117,744 net cash used in investing activities versus $588,929 used in during the year ended December 31, 2019. In the year ending December 31, 2020 this was due to the purchase of fixed assets. In the year ending December 31, 2019, this was due to proceeds from the sale of investments offset by the purchase of fixed assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was $12,460,541 of net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities versus $3,587,330 provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019.
We believe that our current cash in our bank account and working capital as of December 31, 2020 will satisfy our estimated operating cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, the Company will require additional financing in fiscal year 2021 in order to continue at its expected level of operations and potential acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, it may be forced to curtail its development activities.
We anticipate using cash in our bank account as of December 31, 2020, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiaries and from debt or equity financing, or from loans from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds.
Debt Obligations
January 27, 2020 Senior Promissory Note
On January 27, 2020, the Company executed a Senior Promissory Note (the “January Note”) in the principal amount of $250,000 payable to an unaffiliated third-party lender who had previously loaned the Company $2,500,000. The January Note bears interest at the rate of five (5%) percent per annum, paid quarterly in arrears. The January Note matures on May 15, 2020 unless in default. The Company may prepay the January Note within the first six (6) months by payment of unpaid interest for the first six (6) months and, after six (6) months, with a two (2%) percent ($5,000) premium. On February 5, 2021 the Company converted the entire outstanding balance into shares of the Company’s common stock.
February 25, 2020 Senior Promissory Note
On February 25, 2020, the Company executed a Senior Promissory Note (the “February Note”) in the principal amount of $1,000,000 payable to an unaffiliated third-party lender. The February Note bears interest at the rate of eighteen (18%) percent per annum, paid quarterly in arrears. The February Note matured on April 30, 2020 unless in default. The Company repaid the principal balance of this note on July 10, 2020 in full.
May 15, 2019 Senior Convertible Note
On May 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor (the “Buyer”). Upon the closing of this financing, on May 17, 2019, the Company issued for a purchase price of $1,500,000 in principal amount a Senior Convertible Note (the “May 2019 Note”) to the Buyer.
The May 2019 Note provides that the Company will repay the principal amount of the May 2019 Note on the ten (10) month anniversary date of the date of issue. The maturity date was amended on March 23, 2020 to September 16, 2020 and further amended on September 23, 2020 to June 16, 2021. Interest at the rate of nineteen (19%) percent per annum shall be payable on the first day of each calendar month.
The May 2019 Note is convertible at any time by the Holder into 250,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share at the rate of $6.00 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Conversion Price”). Upon an Event of Default (regardless of whether such event has been cured), the Buyer may convert at an alternative conversion price equal to the lower of the then applicable Conversion Price or seventy-five (75%) percent of the then Volume-Weighted Average Price (as defined, the “VWAP”). The Company considered the need for the conversion feature to be bifurcated under ASC 815 and determined that it does not meet the requirements. Additionally, the Company determined the effective conversion rate under ASC 470-20 “Debt with Conversion and Other Options” and determined that the instrument is out of the money and no beneficial conversion feature was recorded.
The May 2019 Note is senior in right of payment to all other existing and future indebtedness of the Company except Permitted Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the May 2019 Note), including $12 million of senior secured indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries under an existing senior loan agreement, plus defined amounts of purchase money indebtedness in connection with bona fide acquisitions.
The May 2019 Note includes customary Events of Default and provides that the Buyer may require the Company to redeem (regardless of whether the Event of Default has been cured) all or a portion of the Note at a redemption premium of one hundred twenty-five (125%) percent, multiplied by the greater of the conversion rate and the then current market price. The Buyer may also require redemption of the May 2019 Note upon a Change of Control (as defined) at a premium of one hundred twenty-five (125%) percent. The Company has the right to redeem the May 2019 Note at any time, in whole or in part, in cash at a price equal to 120% of the then outstanding conversion amount.
Conversion of the May 2019 Note is subject to a blocker provision which prevents any holder from converting the May 2019 Note into shares of common stock if its beneficial ownership of the common stock would exceed 9.99% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock.
Amendment of May 15, 2019 Senior Convertible Note
On March 23, 2020, the Company entered into a Forbearance and Amendment Agreement (the “Agreement”) with an institutional investor (the “Buyer”). The Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with the Buyer on May 15, 2019, pursuant to which the Company issued a Convertible Note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of $1,500,000. The Note was due on or before March 15, 2020 and was not paid (the “Existing Default”). The Note provides that upon an Event of Default, the Buyer may, among other things, require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the Note at a redemption premium of 120%, multiplied by the product of the conversion rate ($6.00per share) and the then current market price.
The Agreement provides that the Buyer will (a) forbear (i) from taking any action with respect to the Existing Default and (ii) from issuing any demand for redemption of the Note on the basis of the Existing Default until the earlier of: (1): (September 16, 2020 (or, if earlier, such date when all amounts outstanding under the Note shall be paid in full or converted into shares of Common Stock in accordance therewith) and (2) the time of any breach by the Company of the Agreement or the occurrence of an Event of Default that is not an Existing Default (the “Forbearance Expiration Date), (b)during the Forbearance Period waive the prepayment premium to any Company Optional Redemption, and (c) during the Forbearance Period, waive the repayment in full of the Note other than the Required Payments (as defined) prior to September 16, 2020. The Scheduled Required Prepayments are $100,000 upon signing the Agreement and five (5) monthly payments thereafter aggregating $200,000 with all amounts outstanding under the Note due on September 16, 2020. In addition, there are mandatory prepayments in the event the Company completes a Subsequent Placement (as defined) or long-term debt (other than from the Buyer or from officers and directors and advisors of the Company) or factoring and purchase order indebtedness, the Company shall effect a Company Optional Redemption amount equal to 50% of the gross proceeds (less reasonable expenses of counsel and any investment bank) together with all Scheduled Required Payments.

Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months
Specifically, our plan of operations for the next 12 months is as follows:
We assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. Over the medium term we assume that we will be able to further expand our market shares. However, during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs.
The Company is growing its business through organic growth by expanding the portfolio of own branded products and the penetration into new geographical market and channels that would add value to the Company’s business and for its Shareholders. This growth is expected to be driven by entering into new markets and countries where the Company can sell and distribute a more profitable series of pharmaceutical products, over-the-counter medicines, and nutraceuticals. It is committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by expanding its customer baseline across the European market, as well as entering markets outside the European Union.
The Company is also committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. Moreover, it hopes to continue to build on its portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand its OTC and nutraceutical product portfolio. Thus, the Company is developing a sound sales distribution network specializing in food supplement products.
The Company’s main objective is expanding the business operations of its subsidiaries by concentrating its efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical Company. The Company views its business development activity as an enabler of its strategies, and it seeks to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic, and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles the Company assesses businesses and assets as part of its regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continues to consider trading development activities for its businesses.
The Company, in the following twelve months, intends to substantially grow its business operations within EU countries and to other countries in the nutraceutical and the OTC and generic pharmaceutical products market. These industries are highly competitive and may significantly affect the Company’s sales of these products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control, and quality assurance.
In addition, the Company seeks to pursue gross profit margin efficiency, by focusing on new revenue streams and sales channels that would positively affect gross profits, such as e-commerce, specialized sales representatives and retail companies. The Company’s objective is the optimization of operating expenses across all entities without compromising the quality of the Company’s services and products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits, and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company’s business.
In addition to expanding the its product portfolio, the Company also plans to evaluate offering its products and services to different geographical markets. It is currently focused on its customers throughout the EU. The Company plans on expanding its geographical reach to new areas outside of the EU market, although it currently has no binding agreements, commitments or contracts in any of these geographical markets. Some of the methods the Company intends to use to accomplish this are: promoting its brand and marketing its products and services through the Internet to new geographic areas, creating strategic relationships with companies in different geographical regions. The Company anticipates that it will spend approximately $100,000 evaluating the different methods and regions to which it plans to expand. This cost is made up of primarily marketing and promotional fees as well as related development expenses. The Company assesses the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. It expects to continue growing through expansion into adjacent products, product categories and channels, as well as through entry into new geographic markets. The Company evaluates potential licensed product acquisition targets based on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital.
The pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential within the European pharmaceutical market, if service, price and quality are strictly directed towards the customer requirements. The Company will continue to encounter competition in the market by product, service, reliability, and a high level of quality. On the procurement side, the Company can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks, the Company diversifies its sources of supply all over Europe. It secures its high-quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection, as well as active suppliers’ system management.
The Company will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand its network of pharmacies and products in areas that it believes will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, it is looking to continue to enhance its product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities. In addition, it remains committed to strategic research and development across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways.
While the Company intends to pursue these milestones, there may be circumstances where, for valid business reasons or due to factors beyond the control of the Company (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), a re-allocation of efforts may be necessary or advisable. Although the Company does not currently anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause material delays in the timelines or estimates set out above, due to the evolving nature of COVID-19 and its impacts, these timelines and estimates may require adjustment in the future.
The Company intends to spend the funds available to it in debt repayment, intangible assets acquisitions, R&D, sales and marketing expenses. Due to the uncertain nature of the industry in which the Company will operate, projects may be frequently reviewed and reassessed. Accordingly, while it is currently intended by management that the available funds will be expended as set forth above, actual expenditures may in fact differ from these amounts and allocations.
Significant Equipment
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment for the next twelve months aside from a few pieces of IT equipment. Nevertheless, we will replace essential equipment for operations if it is required within the year.
Employees
In order to achieve our strategic objectives, we have, and will remain, focused on hiring and retaining a highly skilled management team that has extensive experience and specific skill sets relating to the sales, selection, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business. We have plans to increase the number of our employees by adding more sales people during the next twelve months.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted the modified retrospective adoption in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on January 1, 2018. The new guidance introduces a five-step model for recognizing revenue by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring the promised goods to the customer. Once these steps are met, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product. Adoption of ASC 606 has not changed the timing and nature of the Company’s revenue recognition and there has been no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Foreign Currency. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders’ equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity’s local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings.
Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company is liable for income taxes in Greece and the United Kingdom of England. The corporate income tax rate in Greece is 24%, (tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely) and 19% in the United Kingdom of England. Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.
We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets.
We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management’s judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position’s technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. We operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions.
We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense, respectively.
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes” as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of the U.S. net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.
The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in our parent, Cosmos Holdings Inc., which are applicable to future taxable income in the United States (if any). Additionally, the Company has income tax liabilities in the United Kingdom of England. The income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted. We therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the United States, but recognize the income tax liabilities in Greece and the United Kingdom of England. Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 (“ASU 2020-06”) “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity.” ASU 2020-06 will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models will result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. ASU 2020-06 will be effective January 1, 2024, for the Company. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than January 1, 2021, including interim periods within that year. Management is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on the consolidated financial statements.
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
