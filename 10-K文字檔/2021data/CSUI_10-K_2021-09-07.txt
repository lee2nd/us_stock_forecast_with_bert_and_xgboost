Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Cannabis Suisse Corp. has initiated development of a new IT product called Cannabis Life. It is a mobile application based on an AI-chatbot that will have access to the most up-to-date information and find out data about companies and brands that sell seeds, cannabis types, etc.
Cannabis Life is an innovative way of searching and learning any cannabis related data. Using the most relevant sources of today, the app will keep its users up with the trends and tendencies of cannabis industry. Communicating with the chatbot will be as smooth as it would be with a real human being thus giving users additional immersion into the learning process.

Our auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. Our only sources for cash at this time are investments by others in this offering, selling our products and loans from our director. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business.
Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company’s success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement its business plan and impede the speed of its operations.
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated limited revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Related Party Transactions
There are two signed loan agreements between Cannabis Suisse Corp. and the President/CEO and a Director of the Company, Suneetha Nandana Silva Sudusinghe. The CEO agreed to loan the Loan Amount to the Company in the event of not raising a sufficient amount of funds from the offering in accordance to the Form S-1 registration statement of the Company; the director agreed to loan the Loan Amount to the Company on demand of the Company; the Company will conduct the repayments of all amounts of the Director’s loan accordingly to the sequence of loans; the director will be repaid from revenues of the Company, when it starts to earn significant revenues; advanced Loan funds are non-interest bearing, secured and payable upon demand.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
