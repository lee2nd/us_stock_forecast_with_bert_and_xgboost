ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this report.
General Overview
On August 11, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously adopted a resolution providing for the Company to withdraw from the cannabis industry due to 1) difficulties the Company’s earlier acquisition strategy has encountered at the Company’s recent low stock prices, 2) prolonged uncertainty about the timing of federal legalization of cannabis, and 3) overcrowding of the cannabis industry by large numbers of competitors. As a result, the Company is currently marketing the Good Meds business for sale.
Andina Gold Corp began as Auto Tool Technologies Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 10, 2011. The Company’s name was changed to AFC Building Technologies Inc. effective January 10, 2014. Effective April 26, 2018, the Company changed its name to First Colombia Development Corp. Effective October 14, 2019, the Company changed its name to Redwood Green Corp. Effective September 1, 2020, The Company changed its name to Andina Gold Corp. The Company operates from its corporate headquarters located in Denver, Colorado.
In April 2018, the Company effected a forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a one (1) old for two (2) new basis. Upon effect of the forward split, authorized capital increased from 250,000,000 shares of common stock to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and correspondingly, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 34,760,008 to 73,520,016 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001. The stock split was subsequently reviewed and approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on April 26, 2018.
On May 10, 2018, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding share capital of First Colombia Devco S.A.S. (“Devco”) a Colombian company, and began to establish various business ventures in Colombia in the agriculture and real estate development, tourism, and infrastructure sectors before commencing to phase them out in April 2019.
On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in General Extract, LLC (“General Extract”), a Colorado limited liability company. General Extract was founded in 2015 as an importer, distributor, broker and postprocessor of hemp and hemp derivatives. The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests, including business plans and access to contacts. In consideration of the sale and transfer of the membership interests, the Company delivered 299,170 shares, representing 100% of the ownership of First Colombia Devco.
On July 15, 2019, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Good Acquisition Co., entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire cannabis brands and other assets of Critical Mass Industries, LLC DBA Good Meds (“CMI”), a Colorado limited liability company (“CMI Transaction”). CMI is licensed by the Marijuana Enforcement Division of Colorado Department of Revenue to produce cannabis and cannabis products under its six licenses. These licenses allow for cultivation, manufacturing of infused products and retail distribution. At the time, Colorado law prohibited public companies, including the Company, from owning cannabis licenses. Therefore, CMI spun off assets acquired by the Company into two new entities, Good Holdco, LLC and Good IPCo, LLC. Under the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, CMI retained the cannabis licenses, inventory and accounts receivable and will continue to operate the cannabis business related to these assets under the agreements entered into with Andina Gold. In consideration for the transfer of the acquired assets, the Company delivered 13,553,233 shares of the Company common stock, in addition to $1,999,770 in cash paid to CMI. Effective in 2020, public companies are permitted to own cannabis licenses in Colorado, and the Company is in the process of acquiring the remaining assets of CMI in exchange for 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company.
In August 2020, the Company established a wholly owned Colombian subsidiary, Andina Gold Colombia SAS. This action was taken because the management had identified potential business opportunities in Colombian gold exploration opportunities. Also, in August 2020, the Company merged with its wholly owned Nevada subsidiary, Andina Gold Corp., and changed its name to Andina Gold Corp. On October 21, 2020 FINRA issued an advisory accepting the company’s name change from Redwood Green Corp to Andina Gold Corp and ticker symbol change to AGOL effective as of October 22, 2020 at the opening of the U.S. OTC market. However, following a determination that the Colombian gold exploration opportunities the Company examined in Q4 2020 were rendered impracticable on the short and medium term due to the COVID-19 international travel situation, local pandemic-related restrictions and due to the demise of the Company’s local expert, the Company is now exploring other opportunities to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
The Company is now exploring other opportunities to preserve and enhance shareholder value. .On February 25, 2021 the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with CryoCann USA Corporation (“CryoCann”), a California company headquartered in Santa Ana, California, for a proposed asset purchase transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”). CryoCann is a designer and seller of equipment developed on the basis of patented technology for cannabis varieties harvesting, refinement, and extraction. The technology reduces processing costs, increases the quality of the extracted compounds and has potential for other agricultural applications including hemp and hops. The purchase would include all physical and intellectual assets of CryoCann.
Update on COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has spread throughout the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” and on March 11, 2020, it characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. The impact of COVID-19 developments and uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.
To date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions, both domestic and international, closing of borders and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. As a result, COVID-19 has impacted the Company’s business. Although deemed an essential business during the pandemic, many dispensaries and cannabis manufacturers have suspended or reduced operations on a temporary basis due to matters associated with COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic and responses to this crisis, including actions taken by federal, state and local governments, have had an impact on the operations of the Company, including, without limitation, the following: reduced staffing due to employee suspected conditions and social distancing measures; constraints on productivity; management and staff non-essential business-related travel was constrained due to stay-at-home orders; some employees have shifted to remote work resulting in loss of productivity; consumers visiting dispensaries operated under license impacted by stay-at-home orders. Management continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic situation and federal, state and local recommendations and will provide updates as appropriate.
Our Current Business
Our business portfolio includes the accounts of General Extract, which is controlled by the Company through its 100% ownership interest, and CMI, a variable interest entity (“VIE”) for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and therefore is a consolidated entity of Andina Gold for GAAP purposes.
In June 2020, the Company’s board of directors redirected the Company’s business strategy to exit the cultivation, manufacturing of infused products and retail distribution businesses. Therefore, the Company’s operations and financial results relating to CMI, a VIE of the Company, has been reported as discontinued operations held for sale.
The Company identified strategic opportunities in gold exploration in Colombia and briefly considered moving into the pursuit of opportunities in this field. However, circumstances came to light that rendered these initiatives impractical, including travel restrictions due to Covid-19 and the demise of our local geological advisor.
The Company is currently exploring other opportunities to protect and enhance shareholder value..
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019

The following table shows our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 specifically relating to our variable interest entity, CMI, which is classified as discontinued operations above. The historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.
Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $781,455, which represented an increase of $763,207, or 4,182%, compared to $18,248 of net sales for year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue generating activities for continuing operations are attributable to General Extract. The increase in net sales is due to the fact that General Extract was acquired part way through 2019 and ramped up operations in 2020. CMI net sales were $6,860,282 for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $4,698,428 was related to medical retail, $1,319,944 was related to medical wholesale, $837,414 was related to recreational wholesale, and $4,496 was related to other revenues. Revenue generating activities for discontinued operations are attributable to CMI. CMI net sales were $3,460,566 for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $2,324,024 was related to medical retail, $374,458 was related to medical wholesale, $753,405 was related to recreational wholesale, and $8,679 was related to other revenues. The overall increase in CMI net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3,399,716, or 98%, which is primarily attributable to the fact that CMI was acquired on July 15, 2019, resulting in a full year of activity in 2020 compared to only five and a half months of activity in 2019.
Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $744,279, which represented an increase of $545,457 or 274%, compared to $198,822 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of goods sold primarily consisted of the cost of CBD isolate and the provision for inventory loss. The increase in cost of goods sold is due to the fact that General Extract was acquired part way through 2019 and ramped up operations in 2020. CMI’s cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of allocated salaries and wages of employees directly related to the production process, allocated depreciation directly related to the production process, cultivation supplies, rent and utilities. CMI’s cost of goods sold were $4,901,237 and $2,237,004 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $2,664,233, or 119%. This increase is primarily attributable to the fact that CMI was acquired on July 15, 2019, resulting in a full year of activity in 2020 compared to only five and a half months of activity in 2019.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses encompass personnel costs, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, legal and professional fees, and research and development. Total operating expenses were $6,572,017 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3,152,356 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $3,419,661, or 108%, was primarily attributable to the following changes in operating expenses of:
● Personnel costs - $1,660,814 increase
● General and administrative expenses - $1,444,177 increase
● Legal and professional fees - $901,254 increase
● Research and development - $477,585 decrease
The increase of $1,660,814, or 204%, in personnel costs resulted from Andina Gold Corp. hiring employees and an increase in consulting expenses as its operations began. The increase of $1,444,177, or 161%, in general and administrative expenses is primarily a result of stock-based compensation expense, which the Company incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020 but had no such expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $901,254, or 107%, in legal and professional fees primarily resulted from costs associated with expanded operations attributable to acquiring CMI and the strategic direction of the Company. The company incurred $477,585 of research and development costs in the year ended December 31, 2019 associated with the asset acquisition of General Extract. It was determined the assets acquired had no future alternative use to the Company and were immediately expensed. Comparatively, the Company incurred no research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.
CMI operating expenses encompass personnel costs, sales and marketing, general and administrative, legal and professional fees, and amortization expense. Total operating expenses for CMI were $1,725,950 and $911,156 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $814,794, or 89%. This increase is primarily attributable to the following changes in operating expenses of:
●
●
Personnel costs - $136,224 increase
Sales and marketing - $494,292 increase
● General and administrative expenses - $98,482 increase
● Legal and professional fees - $75,548 increase
The increase is due to the fact that CMI was acquired on July 15, 2019, resulting in a full twelve months of activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to only 5.5 months of activity for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Expense
Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $236,912 interest expense and $88,690 loss on foreign exchange. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $(310) interest expense and $429 loss on foreign exchange. The increase in interest expense was a result of entering into a note and loan payable during 2020 Q3. The 2020 loss on foreign exchange relates to a payable agreement with General Extract’s supplier.
CMI’s other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $153,592 interest expense, which primarily relates to the related party note, $4,663,514 goodwill impairment, and $361,218 intangibles impairment. CMI’s other expense during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $13,013 interest expense resulting from various payables and $3,092 other income. There was no goodwill or intangibles impairment for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net Loss
For the foregoing reasons, we had a net loss of $11,815,907 for the year ended December 31, 2020, or $0.12 net loss per common share - basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $3,057,534 for the year ended December 31, 2019, or $0.03 net loss per common share - basic and diluted.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows
During 2020, the Company obtained a total of $850,000 cash through a convertible note and loan to cover operating expenses. Additionally, the Company raised through a share and warrant offering $626,385 The capital raised was used to cover expenses relating to initial activity in exploring opportunities in gold exploration as well as to cover operating costs of the Company. The Company expects substantial proceeds from the sale of the Good Meds assets in mid-2021 to help cover future operating costs and strategic initiatives.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $3,672,303 and cash balance of $329,839. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to source financing to fund future business strategy, when determined, or that it will be able to sell the Good Meds assets on reasonable terms.
COVID-19 has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of financial markets, which may reduce the Company’s ability to access capital or its customers’ ability to pay the Company for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity. The Company believes that the cash balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its cash needs for the next few months until it can obtain new long-term financing or other sources of capital. If we are unable to attain additional financing, we will have to seek additional strategic alternatives and relief from our additional liabilities accumulated during COVID-19.
The impact of COVID-19 developments and uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic have introduced significant volatility in the financial markets. The uncertainties associated with COVID-19 related to our industry present risk and doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Going Concern
Management believes that we will continue to incur losses for the immediate future. Therefore, we may either need additional equity or debt financing until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, or proceeds from the sale of assets. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to this uncertainty and as to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Capital Resources
The following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital for the periods indicated:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a cash balance of $329,839 and $3,473,770, respectively.

Related Party Disclosures
The following are descriptions of material related party disclosures:
John Knapp
As of March 30, 2020, John Knapp (“Knapp”) owned 9.5% of the shares and is a former board director of the Company. Knapp is the sole owner of Critical Mass Industries Inc. (“CMI”), which effective July 15, 2019, sold all of its assets except marijuana licenses, inventory and accounts receivable to the Company. Pursuant to the CMI transaction, the Company entered into a series of agreements which permit CMI to use the assets in the conduct of its business, as well as provide CMI with additional expertise, including administrative and human resource functions. Also, in conjunction with the CMI transaction, the Company assumed a note payable owing to Knapp. In 2020, the Company formalized the terms of this note payable. The note bears interest on an annual basis of 25% and is convertible into shares of common stock at a price of $0.25 per share. The note matured on January 31, 2021, but as of March 30, 2021 has not been repaid. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding balance of the notes payable, related party was $458,599 and 307,450, respectively. In 2019, CMI was sued by a former consultant.

As of December 31, 2019, Knapp, as the owner of CMI, or CMI itself owed the Company $27,420.65 for legal fees paid on their behalf. Effective February 25, 2020, Knapp resigned as a director of Andina Gold, at which time 200,000 Restricted Stock Units were deemed to have vested and were converted into 200,000 common shares. Refer to Note 2 for additional details on the relationship of CMI as a VIE.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to intangibles, accounting for acquisitions, revenue recognition, income taxes, useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Accounting for Acquisitions
In accordance with the guidance for business combinations, the Company determines whether a transaction or other event is a business combination, which requires that the acquired assets and liabilities assumed constitute a business. Each business combination is then accounted for by applying the acquisition method. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. The Company capitalizes acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expenses acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations.
Revenue Recognition
Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contacts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue following the five-step model prescribed under ASC 606: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company’s revenue consists of sales of cannabis and ancillary products to both retail consumers and wholesale customers. Revenue for retail customers is recognized upon completion of the transaction in the point of sale system and satisfaction of the sale by providing the corresponding inventory at the retail location. Revenue for wholesale customers is recognized upon acceptance of the physical goods and confirmation by acceptance of the inventory in the regulatory marijuana enforcement tracking reporting compliance (“METRC”) system. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers, generally as risk of loss pass, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products. Taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities, are excluded from revenue.
Retail customer loyalty liabilities are recognized in the period in which they are incurred and will often be retired without being utilized. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of sales, which were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company operates in a highly regulated environment in which state regulatory approval is required prior to the customer being able to purchase the product, either through the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division for wholesale clients or the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment for medical patients.
Inventory, net
Inventory, net is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company compares the cost of inventory with market value and write down inventories to net realizable value, if lower. The Company writes down inventory when conditions indicate that the net realizable value may be less than cost due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels or other factors. Due to changing market conditions, management conducted a thorough review of its inventory. As a result, a provision for inventory loss of $400,787 and $163,800 was charged against operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively, to write down inventory to its net realizable value. This was based on the Company’s best estimates of product sales prices and customer demand patterns. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used by the Company to determine its provision for inventory losses will be materially different from the actual amounts or results. These differences could result in materially higher than expected inventory provisions, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition in the near term.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company accounts for variable interest entities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. Management evaluates the relationship between the Company and VIEs and the economic benefit flow of the contractual arrangement with the VIEs. Management determines if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE through a qualitative analysis that identifies which variable interest holder has the controlling financial interest in the VIE. The variable interest holder who has both of the following has the controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In performing our analysis, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the design and activities of the VIE, the terms of the contracts the VIE has entered into, the nature of the VIE’s variable interests issued and how they were negotiated with or marketed to potential investors, and which parties participated significantly in the design or redesign of the entity. As a result of such evaluation, management concluded that the Company is the primary beneficiary of CMI and consolidates the financial results of this entity.
Income Taxes
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740, Income Taxes as of its inception. ASC 740 prescribes the procedures for recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Pursuant to ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company does not have an accrual relating to uncertain tax positions. It is not anticipated that unrecognized tax benefits would significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date.
Assets and Liabilities of Discontinued Operations Held for Sale
Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the assets; (2) the assets are available for immediate sale, in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; (3) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; (4) the sale of the assets is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the assets are being actively marketed for a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value; and (6) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the assets (and liabilities) are classified as held for sale in the balance sheet. Assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation as held for sale.
