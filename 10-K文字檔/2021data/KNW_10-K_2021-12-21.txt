ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
We are focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biosensor technologies which, when paired with our AI deep learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique “signature” of said materials or analytes. We call these our “Bio-RFID™” technology platform when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy; and “ChromaID” technology platform when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with our biosensor technology is analyzed with our trade secret algorithms which are driven by our AI Deep Learning platform.
ChromaID is the first technology developed and patented by the Company. For the past several years, we have focused upon extensions and new patentable inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology and intellectual property. We call this technology platform Bio-RFID. The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly into the commercialization phase of our Company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. Today, the primary focus of the Company is on its Bio-RFID technology, its commercialization and development of related patent assets. Through its wholly owned subsidiary corporations the Company works to exploit additional opportunities and markets that its broad intellectual property and trade secret portfolio addresses.
On April 30, 2020, we incorporated a subsidiary corporation, Particle, Inc. for the purpose of research and development on non-core Company intellectual property. The first research activity, undertaken by a separate Particle team has been on standard threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light that can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. On June 1, 2020, we approved and ratified entry into an intercompany Patent License Agreement dated May 21, 2020 with Particle. Pursuant to the Agreement, Particle received an exclusive non-transferrable license to use certain patents and trademarks of the Company, in exchange the Company shall receive: (i) a one-time fee of $250,000 upon a successful financing of Particle, and (ii) a quarterly royalty payment equal to the greater of 5% of the Gross Sales, net of returns, from Particle or $5,000. As of September 30, 2021, the operations of Particle have generated no sales and operations are just commencing. The first product, the Particle bulb can be used in households, businesses, and other facilities to inactivate bacteria and viruses. Through internal preliminary testing, Particle personnel has confirmed the bulb’s efficacy in inactivating common germs such as E. coli and Staphylococcus. Final study results from Texas Biomedical Research Institute indicate the Particle bulb’s ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and most recently, the Alpha and Delta variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. The Particle team is working on certification, labeling, product manufacturing and related go-to-market requirements; as well as business development activities related to interest from potential strategic and channel partners in both consumer and business applications.
On September 17, 2021 we incorporated a subsidiary corporation, AI Mind, Inc. for the purpose of identifying and capitalizing upon market opportunities for its AI Deep Learning Platform. The first activity undertaken by the subsidiary was the creation of graphical images expressed as Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”) utilizing the AI Deep Learning Platform and our data. We plan to explore other opportunities to monetize its AI Deep Learning Platform over time.
In 2010, we acquired TransTech Systems, Inc. as an adjunct to our business. Operating as an independent subsidiary, TransTech was a distributor of products for employee and personnel identification and authentication. TransTech historically provided substantially all of the Company’s revenues. The financial results from our TransTech subsidiary had been diminishing as vendors of their products increasingly moved to the Internet and direct sales to their customers. TransTech closed on June 30, 2020.

We expect losses to continue as we commercialize our ChromaID™ and Bio-RFID™ technology.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.
We had cash of approximately $12,258,000 and net working capital of approximately $10,093,000 (net of convertible notes payable and right of use asset and liabilities) as of September 30, 2021. We have experienced net losses since inception and we expect losses to continue as we commercialize our ChromaID™ technology. As of September 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $81,326,000 and net losses in the amount of $25,360,000, and $13,563,000 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We incurred non-cash expenses of $17,701,000 and $9,366,000 during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively
On March 15, 2021, we closed private placement for gross proceeds of $14,209,000 in exchange for issuing Subordinated Convertible Notes and 3,552,250 Warrants in a private placement to accredited investors, pursuant to a series of substantially identical Securities Purchase Agreements, Common Stock Warrants, and related documents. The Convertible Notes will be automatically converted to our Common Stock at $2.00 per share on the one year anniversary starting on March 15, 2022.
The Convertible Notes had an original principal amount of $14,209,000 and bear annual interest of 8%. Both the principal amount and the interest are payable on a payment-in-kind basis in shares of our Common Stock.
We believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations through December 31, 2023.
We have financed our corporate operations and our technology development through the issuance of convertible debentures, the issuance of preferred stock, the sale of common stock and the exercise of warrants.
The proceeds of warrants which are not expected to be cashless may generate potential proceeds of up to $17,683,000.

We expect to incur capital expenditures related to the development of the “Bio-RFID™” and “ChromaID™” technologies. None of the expenditures are contractual obligations as of September 30, 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The application of GAAP involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described in Note 2 to the financial statements set forth in this report), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments - ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs).
Derivative Financial Instruments -Pursuant to ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”, we evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. We then determines if embedded derivative must be bifurcated and separately accounted for. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, we use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
Stock Based Compensation - We have share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by us at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718. For options issued to employees, we recognize stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.
Convertible Securities - Based upon ASC 815-15, we have adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities. We will evaluate our contracts based upon the earliest issuance date. In the event partial reclassification of contracts subject to ASC 815-40-25 is necessary, due to our inability to demonstrate we have sufficient shares authorized and unissued, shares will be allocated on the basis of issuance date, with the earliest issuance date receiving first allocation of shares. If a reclassification of an instrument were required, it would result in the instrument issued latest being reclassified first.
