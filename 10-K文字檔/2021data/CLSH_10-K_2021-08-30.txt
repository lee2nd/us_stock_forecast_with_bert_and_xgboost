Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
History and Outlook
We were incorporated on March 31, 2011 as Adelt Design, Inc. to manufacture and market carpet binding art. Production and marketing of carpet binding art never commenced. On November 20, 2014, we adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing our name to CLS Holdings USA, Inc. Effective December 10, 2014, we effected a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-0.625 (the “Reverse Split”), wherein 0.625 shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for each share of common stock issued and outstanding.
On April 29, 2015, the Company, CLS Labs and the Merger Sub consummated the Merger, whereby the Merger Sub merged with and into CLS Labs, with CLS Labs remaining as the surviving entity. As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of CLS Labs and abandoned our previous business. As such, only the financial statements of CLS Labs are included herein.
CLS Labs was originally incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 1, 2014 under the name RJF Labs, Inc. before changing its name to CLS Labs, Inc. on October 24, 2014. It was formed to commercialize a proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via electronic cigarettes (“e-cigarettes”), and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Testing in conjunction with two Colorado growers of this extraction method and conversion process has revealed that it produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace.
On April 17, 2015, CLS Labs took its first step toward commercializing its proprietary methods and processes by entering into the Colorado Arrangement through its wholly owned subsidiary, CLS Labs Colorado, with certain Colorado entities, including PRH. During 2017, we suspended our plans to proceed with the Colorado Arrangement due to regulatory delays and have not yet determined if or when we will pursue them again.
We have been issued a U.S. patent with respect to our proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via electronic cigarettes, and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Internal testing of this extraction method and conversion process has revealed that it produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace. We have not yet commercialized our proprietary process. We plan to generate revenues through licensing, fee-for-service and joint venture arrangements related to our proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into saleable concentrates.
We intend to monetize our extraction and conversion method and generate revenues through (i) the licensing of our patented proprietary methods and processes to others, (ii) the processing of cannabis for others, and (iii) the purchase of cannabis and the processing and sale of cannabis-related products. We plan to accomplish this through the acquisition of companies, the creation of joint ventures, through licensing agreements, and through fee-for-service arrangements with growers and dispensaries of cannabis products. We believe that we can establish a position as one of the premier cannabinoid extraction and processing companies in the industry. Assuming we do so, we then intend to explore the creation of our own brand of concentrates for consumer use, which we would sell wholesale to cannabis dispensaries. We believe that we can create a “gold standard” national brand by standardizing the testing, compliance and labeling of our products in an industry currently comprised of small, local businesses with erratic and unreliable product quality, testing practices and labeling. We also plan to offer consulting services through Cannabis Life Sciences Consulting, LLC, which will generate revenue by providing consulting services to cannabis-related businesses, including growers, dispensaries and laboratories, and driving business to our processing facilities. Finally, we intend to grow through select acquisitions in secondary and tertiary markets, targeting newly regulated states that we believe offer a competitive advantage. Our goal at this time is to become a successful regional cannabis company.
On December 4, 2017, we entered into the Acquisition Agreement with Alternative Solutions to acquire the outstanding equity interests in the Oasis LLCs. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, as amended, we paid a non-refundable deposit of $250,000 upon signing, which was followed by an additional payment of $1,800,000 on February 5, 2018, for an initial 10% of Alternative Solutions and each of the subsidiaries. At the closing of our purchase of the remaining 90% of the ownership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs, which occurred on June 27, 2018, we paid the following consideration: $5,995,543 in cash, a $4.0 million promissory note due in December 2019, and $6,000,000 in shares of our common stock. The cash payment of $5,995,543 was less than the $6,200,000 payment originally contemplated because we assumed an additional $204,457 of liabilities. The Oasis Note, which was repaid in full in December 2019, was secured by all of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs and by the assets of the Oasis LLCs. At that time, we applied for regulatory approval to own an interest in the Oasis LLCs, which approval was received on June 21, 2018. Just prior to closing, the parties agreed that we would instead acquire all of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions, the parent of the Oasis LLCs, from its members, and the membership interests in the Oasis LLCs owned by members other than Alternative Solutions. We have applied for regulatory approval to own our interest in the Oasis LLCs through Alternative Solutions under the final structure of the transaction, which is currently under review.
In October 31, 2018, the Company, CLS Massachusetts, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“CLS Massachusetts”), and In Good Health, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“IGH”), entered into an Option Agreement (the “IGH Option Agreement”). Under the terms of the IGH Option Agreement, CLS Massachusetts had an exclusive option to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of IGH (the “IGH Option”) during the period beginning on the earlier of the date that is one year after the effective date of the conversion and December 1, 2019 and ending on the date that was 60 days after such date. If CLS Massachusetts exercised the IGH Option, the Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and IGH would enter into a merger agreement (the form of which has been agreed to by the parties) (the “IGH Merger Agreement”). At the effective time of the merger contemplated by the IGH Merger Agreement, CLS Massachusetts would pay a purchase price of $47,500,000, subject to reduction as provided in the IGH Merger Agreement, payable as follows: $35 million in cash, $7.5 million in the form of a five-year promissory note, and $5 million in the form of restricted common stock of the Company, plus $2.5 million as consideration for a non-competition agreement with IGH’s President, payable in the form of a five-year promissory note. IGH and certain IGH stockholders holding sufficient aggregate voting power to approve the transactions contemplated by the IGH Merger Agreement had entered into agreements pursuant to which such stockholders had, among other things, agreed to vote in favor of such transactions. On October 31, 2018, as consideration for the IGH Option, we made a loan to IGH, in the principal amount of $5,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in that certain loan agreement, dated as of October 31, 2018 between IGH as the borrower and the Company as the lender. The loan was evidenced by a secured promissory note of IGH, which bore interest at the rate of 6% per annum and was to mature on October 31, 2021. To secure the obligations of IGH to us under the loan agreement and the promissory note, the Company and IGH entered into a security agreement dated as of October 31, 2018, pursuant to which IGH granted to us a first priority lien on and security interest in all personal property of IGH. If we did not exercise the Option on or prior to the date that was 30 days following the end of the option period, the loan amount was to be reduced to $2,500,000 as a break-up fee, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the IGH Option Agreement. On August 26, 2019, the parties amended the IGH Option Agreement to, among other things, delay the closing until January 2020. By letter agreement dated January 31, 2020, the parties extended the IGH Option Agreement to February 4, 2020. On February 4, 2020, CLS Massachusetts exercised the IGH Option.
By letter dated February 26, 2020, we informed IGH that as a result of its breaches of the IGH Option, which remained uncured, an event of default had occurred under the IGH Note. We further advised IGH that we were electing to cause the IGH Note to bear interest at the default rate of 15% per annum effective February 26, 2020 and to accelerate all amounts due under the IGH Note. On March 3, 2020, we filed a claim for declaratory relief, among other things, requesting the court declare that CLS Massachusetts had validly exercised the IGH Option and instruct IGH to comply with its diligence requests and ultimately execute a merger agreement with us. The dispute regarding whether CLS Massachusetts properly exercised the IGH Option arose after CLS Massachusetts delivered a notice of exercise to IGH and IGH subsequently asserted that CLS Massachusetts’ exercise was invalid. On February 27, 2021, IGH notified us that it did not plan to make further payments under the IGH Note on the theory that the Break-Up fee excused additional payments. We vehemently disagreed with this assertion. At May 31, 2021, we had collected a total of $2,901,569 of principal and $220,196 of interest on the IGH Note. During the twelve months ended May 31, 2021, we impaired the remaining amounts due under the IGH Note in the amount of $2,498,706, which includes $2,497,884 in principal and $822 in accrued interest. As of May 31, 2021, the principal balance of the IGH Note was $0 and the interest receivable was $0.
On June 14, 2021, the parties to the IGH lawsuit entered into a confidential settlement agreement to resolve the action and a secured promissory note dated and executed by IGH in favor of the Company effective on June 11, 2021. Pursuant to the promissory note, IGH shall pay the Company $3,000,000, $500,000 of which was paid on or before June 21, 2021. A second payment of $500,000 was paid on or before July 12, 2021. The remaining $2,000,000 and accrued interest is to be paid in 12 equal, monthly installments beginning on August 12, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the promissory note.
On September 13, 2018, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the “CannAssist LOI”) with CannAssist, LLC (“CannAssist”) setting forth the terms and conditions upon which we proposed to acquire an 80% ownership interest in CannAssist. On January 29, 2019, we made a line of credit loan to CannAssist, in the principal amount of up to $500,000, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in that certain Loan Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2019 between CannAssist as the Borrower and the Company as the Lender (the “CannAssist Loan Agreement”). The Loan was evidenced by a secured promissory note of CannAssist (the “CannAssist Note”), which bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum and was personally guaranteed by the two equity owners of CannAssist. CannAssist had drawn down $325,000 on the CannAssist Note. On March 11, 2019, the Company, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CLS Massachusetts, entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the “CannAssist Purchase Agreement”) with CannAssist, each of the members of CannAssist, and David Noble, as the members’ representative. Mr. Noble currently serves as the President of IGH, an entity that we hold an option to acquire. After conducting diligence regarding the cost of the planned buildout of the CannAssist facility, the parties jointly decided to terminate the CannAssist Purchase Agreement effective August 26, 2019 and declared the CannAssist Note due and payable in full not later than February 28, 2020. On December 23, 2019, we received payment in full on the CannAssist Note in the amount of $342,567, which comprised $325,000 of principal and $17,567 of interest.
On January 4, 2018, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the memorandum issued by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 (as amended on February 14, 2014, the “Cole Memo”), the Cole Banking Memorandum, and all other related Obama-era DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance. While the rescission did not change federal law, as the Cole Memo and other DOJ guidance documents were not themselves laws, the rescission removed the DOJ’s formal policy that state-regulated cannabis businesses in compliance with the Cole Memo guidelines should not be a prosecutorial priority. Notably, former Attorney General Sessions’ rescission of the Cole Memo has not affected the status of the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) memorandum issued by the Department of Treasury, which remains in effect. This memorandum outlines Bank Secrecy Act-compliant pathways for financial institutions to service state-sanctioned cannabis businesses, which echoed the enforcement priorities outlined in the Cole Memo. In addition to his rescission of the Cole Memo, Attorney General Sessions issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum”. The Sessions Memorandum explains the DOJ’s rationale for rescinding all past DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance, claiming that Obama-era enforcement policies are “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, in chapter 9.27.230 of the U.A. Attorneys’ Manual (“USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memo, are based on the use of the federal government’s limited resources and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Although the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a federally illegal Schedule I controlled substance, it does not otherwise instruct U.S. Attorneys to consider the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses a DOJ priority, and in practice, most U.S. Attorneys have not changed their prosecutorial approach to date. However, due to the lack of specific direction in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority federal prosecutors should ascribe to such cannabis activities, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not seek to prosecute cases involving cannabis businesses that are otherwise compliant with state law.
William Barr served as United States Attorney General from February 14, 2019 to December 23, 2020. The DOJ under Mr. Barr did not take a formal position on federal enforcement of laws relating to cannabis. On March 11, 2021, United States President Biden’s nominee, Merrick Garland was sworn in as the U.S. Attorney General. During his campaign, President Biden stated a policy goal to decriminalize possession of cannabis at the federal level, but he has not publicly supported the full legalization of cannabis. It is unclear what impact, if any, the new administration will have on U.S. federal government enforcement policy on cannabis. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that the position of the Department of Justice will not change.
We incurred a net loss of $15,890,514 for the year ended May 31, 2021, resulting in an accumulated deficit as of May 31, 2021 of $92,736,638. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Recent Developments - COVID-19
On March 12, 2020, Governor Steven Sisolak declared a State of Emergency related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. This State of Emergency was initiated due to the multiple confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the State of Nevada. On March 17, 2020, pursuant to the Declaration of Emergency, Governor Sisolak released the Nevada Health Response COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Initiative (“Initiative”). This Initiative provided guidance related to the March 12 Declaration of Emergency, requiring Nevadans to stay home and all nonessential businesses to temporarily close to the public for thirty (30) days. In the Initiative, it was declared that licensed cannabis stores and medical dispensaries could remain open only if employees and consumers strictly adhered to the social distancing protocols.
In light of the Initiative, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 003 on March 20, 2020 which mandated retail cannabis dispensaries to operate as delivery only. On April 29, 2020, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 016 which amended the cannabis section of Directive 003 and permitted licensed cannabis dispensaries to engage in retail sales on a curbside pickup or home delivery basis pursuant to guidance from the Cannabis Compliance Board. Through Directive 016, licensed cannabis dispensaries were able to begin curbside pickup on May 1, 2020 so long as the facility adhered to protocols developed by the Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”).
In accordance with Directive 016, the CCB released guidelines related to curbside pickup requiring all facilities wishing to offer curbside pickup to first submit and receive approval from the CCB. Serenity Wellness Center LLC developed the required procedures and submitted and received State approval on April 30, 2020 to conduct curbside pickup sales effective May 1, 2020. Further, the City of Las Vegas required cannabis facilities to obtain a temporary 30-day curbside pickup permit. Serenity Wellness Center LLC was issued its first temporary curbside pickup permit from the City of Las Vegas on May 1, 2020. Serenity Wellness Center LLC has subsequently received a temporary curbside permit every thirty (30) days thereafter. Upon expiration every 30 days, the City of Las Vegas reviews the licensee and determines if a new temporary permit shall be issued.
On May 7, 2020, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 018. Directive 018 worked to reopen the State of Nevada as a part of Phase One of the Nevada United: Roadmap to Recovery Plan introduced by Governor Sisolak on April 30, 2020. Directive 018 provided that, in addition to curbside pickup or home delivery, licensed cannabis dispensaries could engage in retail sales on an in-store basis effective May 9, 2020, pursuant to guidance from the CCB. The CCB required facilities wishing to engage in limited in-store retail sales to submit Standard Operating Procedures and receive approval of the same. Serenity Wellness Center LLC developed the required procedures and submitted and received State approval on May 8, 2020 to conduct limited in-store retail sales effective May 9, 2020. The City of Las Vegas did not require a separate permit for limited in-store sales.
On July 31, 2020, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 029 reaffirming The Nevada United: Roadmap to Recovery Plan. Directive 029 stated that all directives promulgated pursuant to the March 12, 2020 Declaration of Emergency or subsections thereof set to expire on July 31, 2020, would remain in effect for the duration of the current state of emergency unless terminated prior to that date by a subsequent directive or by operation of law associated with lifting the Declaration of Emergency. Further, Directive 029, having become effective at 11:59 PM on Friday, July 31, 2020 shall remain in effect until terminated by a subsequent directive promulgated pursuant to the March 12, 2020 Declaration of Emergency, or dissolution or lifting of the Declaration of Emergency itself, to facilitate the State’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve and the ways that our business may evolve to respond to the pandemic and the needs of our customers cannot be fully known.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020
The table below sets forth our expenses as a percentage of revenue for the applicable periods:
The table below sets forth certain statistical and financial highlights for the applicable periods:
(1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial performance measures and should not be considered as alternatives to net income(loss) or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. As required by the rules of the SEC, we provide below a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein to the most directly comparable measure under GAAP. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-cash expenses not already excluded as part of EBITDA as well as the impact of the significant litigation expenses, which were associated with our action against IGH related to its breach of the IGH Option, and which has been settled. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of our profitability measures for the periods presented.
Reconciliation of net loss for the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020 to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is in the table below:
Revenues
We had revenue of $19,292,087 during the year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of $7,374,458, or 62%, compared to revenue of $11,917,629 during the year ended May 31, 2020. Our cannabis dispensary accounted for $14,595,115, or 76%, of our revenue for the year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of $5,230,010, or 56%, compared to $9,365,105 during the year ended May 31, 2020. Dispensary revenue also increased during the 2021 fiscal year because our average sales per day increased from $25,588 during fiscal 2020 to $39,987 during fiscal 2021. Our cannabis production accounted for $4,696,972, or 24%, of our revenue for the year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of $2,144,448, or 84%, compared to $2,552,524 for the year ended May 31, 2020. The increase in production revenues for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to delays during fiscal 2020 in making changes to our wholesale product mix dictated by market demand during construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. Such changes have now been implemented. The increase in wholesale revenue for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the impact of our rebranding and relaunch efforts, which commenced in September 2020.
Cost of Goods Sold
Our cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2021 was $9,644,761, an increase of $3,685,475, or 62%, compared to cost of goods sold of $5,959,286 for the year ended May 31, 2020. The increase in cost of goods sold for the year ended May 31, 2021 was due primarily to our increase in sales during fiscal 2021. Cost of goods sold was 50% of sales during both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 resulting in a 50% gross margin for both years, which is our target. Cost of goods sold during fiscal 2021 primarily consisted of $8,596,979 of product cost, $649,766 of state and local fees and taxes, and $345,716 of supplies and materials.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased by $2,024,068, or approximately 23%, to $10,800,944 during the year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $8,776,876 for the year ended May 31, 2020. The increase in SG&A expenses for the twelve months ended May 31, 2021 was primarily due to office and facilities costs incurred in connection with our expanded manufacturing facility; payroll and related expenses due to an increase in commissions related to increased sales, and increased staffing needed to support this sales growth; and costs directly related to our response to COVID-19.
SG&A expense during fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an aggregate of $8,249,589 in costs associated with operating the Oasis LLCs, an increase of $2,124,783 compared to $6,124,806 during fiscal 2020. The major components of the $2,125,157 increase in SG&A associated with the operation of the Oasis LLCs during the twelve months ended May 31, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended May 31, 2020 were as follows: lease, facilities and office costs of $1,943,555 compared to $1,075,219; payroll and related costs of $4,106,545 compared to $3,421,119; sales, marketing, and advertising costs of $1,237,326 compared to $563,425; and depreciation and amortization of $685,292 compared to $449,192. Payroll and marketing costs increased during fiscal 2021 due to the growth in revenues of the Oasis LLCs during fiscal 2021; our use of a third-party marketing firm for campaigns to promote brand awareness, the re-branding of our City Trees products and packaging; and costs incurred in connection with our response to COVID-19. Lease, facilities, and office costs increased due to our expanded production facility and due to costs incurred in connection with our response to COVID-19. These increases in costs were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $92,594, and a decrease in taxes, licenses, and registration fees by $44,428.
Finally, SG&A decreased by an aggregate of $99,805 during fiscal 2021 as a result of a decrease in the expenses associated with the ongoing implementation of other aspects of our business plan and our general corporate overhead to an aggregate of $2,551,150, from $2,650,956 during fiscal 2020. The major components of this decrease compared to fiscal 2020 were as follows: sales, marketing, and investor relations costs decreased by $202,277; travel related expenses decreased by $93,964; non-cash compensation decreased by $89,701; and payroll and related fees decreased by $27,610. These decreases were primarily due to a decline in travel and our spend on investor relations during fiscal 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization in the amount of $142,499; and an increase in professional fees in the amount of $128,155.
Impairment of Goodwill
We review the value of our intangible property on an annual basis as required by applicable accounting principles. Although our revenue and gross profit from our operation of the Oasis LLCs have improved since we acquired these companies and are projected by management to continue to improve, due to the sharp decline in our stock price over fiscal 2020, which translated to a lower enterprise value for our company as a whole during fiscal 2020, we calculated that the net carrying value of the goodwill associated with our acquisition of the Oasis LLCs in the amount of $25,742,899 exceeded the fair value by $25,185,003. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to operations in this amount during the year ended May 31, 2020. Fair value was based upon the price of our common stock at May 31, 2020, of $0.06 per share, compared to our stock price at May 31, 2019, which was $0.30 per share. There was no comparable charge during fiscal 2021.
Impairment of Note Receivable
During the twelve months ended May 31, 2021, we recorded an impairment of the IGH Note in the amount of $2,498,706; there was no comparable transaction during the prior fiscal year. This impairment arose after IGH notified us on February 27, 2021, that it did not plan to make further payments in accordance with the terms of the IGH Note on the theory that the Break-Up Fee excused such additional payments. We vehemently disagreed with this assertion. On June 14, 2021, the parties to the IGH lawsuit entered into a confidential settlement agreement to resolve the action and a secured promissory note dated and executed by IGH in favor of us effective on June 11, 2021. Pursuant to the promissory note, IGH shall pay us $3,000,000, $500,000 of which was due and payable on or before June 21, 2021. A second payment of $500,000 was due and payable on or before July 12, 2021. The remaining $2,000,000 and accrued interest shall be paid in 12 equal, monthly installments beginning on August 12, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the promissory note. In June and July 2021, we received the first three payments due under the confidential settlement agreement in the aggregate amount of $1,167,000.
Interest Expense, Net
Our interest expense, net of interest income, was $3,657,105 for the year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of $715,974, or 24%, compared to $2,941,131 for the year ended May 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the write-off of discounts on debentures in the amount $622,955 in connection with the amendment of U.S. Convertible Debentures 1, 2 and 4 and the Canaccord Debentures during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2021 was also partially due to a decrease in interest income during fiscal 2021 in the amount of $160,950, from $310,923 during the year ended May 31, 2020 to $149,973 during the year ended May 31, 2021. This decrease occurred due to the lower principal balance under the IGH Note and the zero balance on the CannAssist Note, which was paid in full in December 2019.
Loss on Amendment of Debt
In March and April 2021, certain of our convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $19,729,822 were amended such that the conversion prices were reduced from $0.80 to $0.30 and the maturity dates were extended for one year. We recognized a loss on the amendment of debt in the amount of $6,105,679 in connection with these amendments, which was charged to operations during fiscal 2021. There was no comparable transaction in the prior fiscal year.
Gain on Settlement of Liabilities
During the year ended May 31, 2020, we made a prepayment on the Oasis Note in connection with the settlement of a dispute between the former owners of Alternative Solutions and a consultant, and the amount of $275,000, which we had accrued with respect to this dispute, was extinguished. There was no comparable transaction during the fiscal 2021.
Gain on Modification of Leases
During the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, we revised several of our Nevada operating leases for the use of warehouse and office facilities, which resulted in a gain on modification of leases in the amounts of $14,889 for fiscal 2021 and $28,511 for fiscal 2020.
Loss on Disposal of Assets
During the year ended May 31, 2020, we recognized a loss on the disposal of assets in the amount of $16,817 in connection with the discontinued use of capitalized software. There was no comparable transaction during the 2021 fiscal year.
Provision for Income Taxes
We recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of $2,490,295 during the year ended May 31, 2021 compared to $0 during the year ended May 31, 2020. Although we have net operating losses that we believe are available to us to offset this entire tax liability, which arises under Section 280E of the Code because we are a cannabis company, as a conservative measure, we have accrued this liability.
Net Loss
Our net loss for the year ended May 31, 2021 was $15,890,514 compared to $30,657,973 for the year ended May 31, 2020, a decrease of $14,767,459, or 48%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our total current assets, liabilities and working capital at May 31, 2021 and 2020:
At May 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit of $1,143,922, a decrease of $7,203,514 from the working capital of $6,059,592 we had at May 31, 2020. Our working capital at May 31, 2021, includes $1,665,263 of cash. Our working capital was reduced by the impairment of the IGH Note of $2,498,706. Subsequent to May 31, 2021, we settled our lawsuit with IGH for a $3,000,000 note, which replaced the IGH Note, and since such time, IGH has made three payments on the new note and such note remains current. Additionally, we recorded a $2,490,295 liability for income taxes on May 31, 2021, which taxes are imposed because we are a cannabis company. We believe we have net operating losses sufficient to offset this income tax liability in full. These two items together decreased our working capital as of May 31, 2021 by $4,989,001. If we had not made these two adjustments, our working capital as of May 31, 2021 would have been $3,845,079.
Our working capital needs will likely continue to increase, and if we require additional funds to meet them, we will seek additional debt or equity financing. We have operated at a loss since inception.
On June 14, 2021, we settled our lawsuit with IGH and IGH executed a note for $3,000,000 to replace the IGH Note that was impaired. In addition, we believe we have net operating losses to offset the income tax payable. As a result, our current working capital has likely improved.
Cash flows used in operating activities were $2,535,159 during the year ended May 31, 2021, a decrease of $627,806, or approximately 20%, compared to $3,162,965 during the year ended May 31, 2020. In deriving cash flows used in operating activities from the net losses for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, there were net amounts of $11,561,585 and $27,194,179, respectively, of non-cash items that were added back to the net loss for each such year. For fiscal 2021, the most significant item added back to the net loss was $6,105,679 related to the loss on extinguishment of debt; there was no comparable charge during fiscal 2020. We also recorded the following significant items in fiscal 2021: $2,497,884 impairment of note receivable related to the IGH Note, compared to $0 during fiscal 2020; $2,203,234 of amortization of debt discounts primarily associated with the amendment of our convertible debt during fiscal 2021 compared to $1,647,664 during fiscal 2020; and $685,292 of depreciation and amortization during fiscal 2021 compared to $449,192 during fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2020, the most significant item added back to the net loss was $25,185,003 related to the impairment of goodwill; there was no comparable charge during fiscal 2021.
Finally, our cash used in operating activities was affected by changes in the components of working capital. The amounts of the components of working capital fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including management’s expectation of required inventory levels; the amount of accrued interest, both receivable and payable; the amount of prepaid expenses; the amount of accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities; our accounts payable and accounts receivable balances; and the capitalization of right of use assets and liabilities associated with operating leases. The overall net change in the components of working capital resulted in a decrease in cash from operating activities in the amount of $712,026 during the twelve months ended May 31, 2021, compared to an increase in cash from operating activities of $192,437 during the prior twelve months of fiscal 2020. The more significant changes for the year ended May 31, 2021 were as follows: inventory increased by $652,810, compared to a decrease of $171,591 during the prior fiscal year because we increased inventory levels in our production and wholesale division as part of the rebranding and relaunch that occurred in September 2020; accounts receivable increased by $539,324 compared to an increase of $106,230 during the prior fiscal year due to an increase in sales volume; accounts payable and accrued interest increased by $435,742 compared to a decrease of $74,319 during the prior fiscal due to increased business activity including an increase in city and state sales and excise taxes due; and accrued interest increased by $258,113 compared to $1,300,715 during the prior fiscal year as we began to pay the accrued interest on the convertible debentures during the current fiscal year, which interest was capitalized during the prior fiscal year.
Cash flows provided by investing activities were $1,274,854 for the year ended May 31, 2021, an increase of $1,712,944, or 391%, compared to cash flow used by investing activities of $438,090 during the year ended May 31, 2020. During the year ended May 31, 2021, we received principal payments on the IGH Note in the amount of $1,544,291, compared to cash collected on the CannAssist Note in the amount $1,357,278 and on the IGH Note in the amount of $325,000 in the prior fiscal year. We also made an additional loan to CannAssist in the amount of $175,000 during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020; there was no comparable transaction during fiscal 2021. During the current fiscal year, we made payments for property and equipment in the amount of $269,437, compared to $1,923,338 in fiscal 2020. The decrease was due to the completion of the build-out of our production facility during fiscal 2020.
Cash flows used in financing activities were $0 for the year ended May 31, 2021, a decrease of $3,999,168 or 100%, compared to cash generated by financing activities of $3,999,168 during the year ended May 31, 2020. During the year ended May 31, 2021, we did not make any principal payments on our debt compared to principal payments on the Oasis Note in the aggregate amount of $3,999,168 during fiscal 2020.
Third Party Debt
The table below summarizes the status of our third party debt and reflects whether such debt remains outstanding, has been repaid, or has been converted into or exchanged for our common stock:
Oasis Note
On June 27, 2018, we closed on the purchase of the remaining 90% of the membership interests of Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs. The closing occurred pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement dated December 4, 2017, as amended. On such date, we made the payments to indirectly acquire the remaining 90% of the Oasis LLCs, which were equal to cash in the amount of $5,995,543, a $4.0 million promissory note due in December 2019 (the “Oasis Note”), and 22,058,823 shares of our common stock. The cash payment of $5,995,543 was less than the $6,200,000 payment originally contemplated because we assumed an additional $204,457 in liabilities. The Oasis Note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The principal amount of the Oasis Note was reduced in August 2019, in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, as a result of the settlement of the dispute between the former owners of Alternative Solutions and 4Front Advisors, a consultant to Alternative Solutions. The terms of the settlement with 4Front Advisors are confidential. The Oasis Note is secured by all of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs and by the assets of the Oasis LLCs. On December 31, 2019, we repaid the remaining amount of the note, which comprised $1,363,925 of principal and $370,370 of interest.
2018 U.S. Convertible Debenture Offering
Between October 22, 2018 and November 2, 2018, we entered into six subscription agreements, pursuant to which we agreed to sell, $5,857,000 in original principal amount of convertible debentures in minimum denominations of $1,000 each for an aggregate purchase price of $5,857,000.
Under the original terms, the debentures bear interest, payable quarterly, at a rate of 8% per annum, with capitalization of accrued interest on a quarterly basis for the first 18 months, by increasing the then-outstanding principal amount of the debentures. The debentures originally matured on a date that was three years following their issuance. The debentures were convertible into units at a conversion price of $0.80 per unit. Each unit consists of (i) one share of our common stock, par value $0.001 and (ii) one-half of one warrant, with each warrant exercisable for three years to purchase a share of common stock at an initial price of $1.10. The warrants also provided that we could force their exercise at any time after the bid price of our common stock exceeds $2.20 for a period of 20 consecutive business days. The debentures include a provision for the capitalization of accrued interest on a quarterly basis for the first 18 months. After capitalizing accrued interest in the aggregate amount of $738,663, the aggregate principal amount of the debentures increased to $6,595,663.
The debentures have other features, such as mandatory conversion in the event our common stock trades at a particular price over a specified period of time and required redemption in the event of a “Change in Control” of the Company. The debentures are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment of principal and interest with all other unsecured obligations of the Company. The warrants have anti-dilution provisions that provide for an adjustment to the exercise price in the event of a future sale of our common stock at a lower price, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the warrant.
On July 26, 2019, we entered into amendments to the debentures with four of the purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to reduce the conversion price of the original debentures if, in general, we issue or sell common stock, or warrants or options exercisable for common stock, or any other securities convertible into common stock, in a capital raising transaction, at a consideration per share, or exercise or conversion price per share, as applicable, less than the conversion price of the original debentures in effect immediately prior to such issuance. In such case, the conversion price of the original debentures will be reduced to such issuance price. The amendments also provided that, if a dilutive issuance occurs, the warrant to be issued upon conversion will be exercisable at a price equal to 137.5% of the Adjusted Conversion Price at the time of conversion of the debenture. If a dilutive issuance occurs, the form of warrant attached to the subscription agreement would be amended to change the Initial Exercise Price, as defined therein, to be the Revised Warrant Exercise Price.
The Debenture Amendment (as hereafter defined) was a dilutive issuance. As a result, the conversion price of the convertible debentures was automatically reduced from $0.80 per unit to $0.30 per unit and the form of warrant attached to the subscription agreement will be amended to reduce the exercise price from $1.10 per share of common stock to 137.5% of the debenture conversion price (presently $0.4125 per share of common stock).
On April 15, 2021 and April 19, 2021, we amended the three of the purchasers’ debentures and subscription agreements in order to (i) reduce the conversion price of the debentures from $0.80 per unit to $0.30 per unit, and (ii) extend the maturity date of the debentures by one year to four (4) years from the execution date of the debentures. The subscription agreements, as amended, also provide that we will file a registration statement to register for resale all of the shares of common stock issuable to these three purchasers upon conversion of the debentures and the exercise of the warrants issuable upon conversion of such debentures. Each warrant issuable pursuant to the debentures is exercisable for one share of common stock at a price equal to 137.5% of the conversion price (presently $0.4125 per share) for a period of three-years from the earlier of the date of issuance of the warrant or the effectiveness of a registration statement registering the warrant shares.
2018 Convertible Debenture Offering
On December 12, 2018, we entered into an agency agreement with two Canadian agents regarding a private offering of up to $40 million of convertible debentures of the Company at an issue price of $1,000 per debenture (the “Canaccord Debentures”). The agents sold the convertible debentures on a commercially reasonable efforts private placement basis. Each debenture was convertible into units of the Company at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $0.80 per unit at any time prior to the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the debentures, being the date that is three (3) years from the closing date of the offering (the “2018 Convertible Debenture Offering”). Each unit will be comprised of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one-half of a share of common stock. Each warrant was initially exercisable for one share of common stock at a price of $1.10 per warrant for a period of 36 months from the closing date.
We closed the 2018 Convertible Debenture Offering on December 12, 2018, issuing $12,012,000 million in 8% senior unsecured convertible debentures at the initial closing. At the closing, we paid the agents: (A)(i) a cash fee of $354,000 for advisory services provided to us in connection with the offering; (ii) a cash commission of $720,720, equivalent to 6.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds received at the closing of the offering; (B)(i) an aggregate of 184,375 units for advisory services; and (ii) a corporate finance fee equal to 375,375 units, which is the number of units equal to 2.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds received at the closing of the offering divided by the conversion price; and (C)(i) an aggregate of 442,500 advisory warrants; and (ii) 900,900 broker warrants, which was equal to 6.0% of the gross proceeds received at the closing of the offering divided by the conversion price. During the year ended May 31, 2020, principal in the amount of $25,856 was converted into 32,319 shares of common stock. The debentures include a provision for the capitalization of accrued interest on a quarterly basis for the first 18 months. Accrued interest in the amount of $1,514,006 was capitalized, and the principal amount of the debentures is $13,500,150.
The debentures are unsecured obligations of the Company, rank pari passu in right of payment of principal and interest and were issued pursuant to the terms of a debenture indenture, dated December 12, 2018, between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company as the debenture trustee. The debentures bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum from the closing date, payable on the last business day of each calendar quarter.
Beginning on the date that is four (4) months plus one (1) day following the closing date, we could force the conversion of all of the principal amount of the then outstanding debentures at the conversion price on not less than 30 days’ notice should the daily volume weighted average trading price, or VWAP, of our common stock be greater than $1.20 per share for the preceding 10 consecutive trading days.
Upon a change of control of the Company, holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures at a price equal to 105% of the principal amount of the debentures then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The debentures also contain standard anti-dilution provisions.
On March 31, 2021, the holders of the Canaccord Debentures approved the amendment of the indenture related to the Canaccord Debentures (the “Debenture Amendment”) to: (i) extend the maturity date of the Canaccord Debentures from December 12, 2021 to December 12, 2022; (ii) reduce the conversion price from $0.80 per unit (as such term is defined in the indenture) to $0.30 per unit; (iii) reduce the mandatory conversion VWAP threshold from $1.20 to $0.60 per share; and (iv) amend the definitions of “Warrant” and “Warrant Indenture” (as such terms are defined in the indenture), to reduce the exercise price of each warrant to $0.40 per share of our common stock. Simultaneously, we amended the warrant indenture to make conforming amendments and extend the expiration date of the warrants to March 31, 2024.
If, at the time of exercise of any warrant in accordance with the warrant indenture, there is no effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale by the holder of a portion of the shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of the warrant, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the resale of the shares of common stock by the holder under the Securities Act by reason of a blackout or suspension of use thereof, then the warrants may be exercised, in part for that portion of the shares of common stock not registered for resale by the holder under an effective registration statement or in whole in the case of the prospectus not being available for the resale of such shares of common stock, at such time by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where: A = the last volume weighted average price, or VWAP, for the trading day immediately preceding the time of delivery of the exercise form giving rise to the applicable “cashless exercise”; B = the exercise price of the warrant; and X = the number of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon exercise of the warrant in accordance with the terms of such warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.
Pursuant to the agency agreement, we granted the agents an option to increase the offering by an additional $6 million in principal amount of debentures, which option was not exercised by the agents prior to the closing date of the offering.
Pursuant to the agency agreement and the subscription agreements signed by investors in the offering, we granted certain registration rights to the holders of the debentures pursuant to which we agreed to prepare and file a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale by the original purchasers of the debentures of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures or exercise of the warrants.
Over the next twelve months we will likely require additional capital to cover our projected corporate level cash flow deficits, and the implementation of our business plan, including the development of other revenue sources, such as possible acquisitions.
During the next twelve months we do not have any capital projects planned. We may pursue additional acquisitions in the next twelve months but we have not entered into any definitive agreements with respect to either additional acquisitions or the capital necessary to finance them. If we do pursue any acquisitions, we would likely fund them with the proceeds of future equity sales, warrant exercise proceeds, loans or seller financings. We have not pursued the availability of any such sources at present.
Although our revenues are expected to grow as we expand our operations, our revenues only recently exceeded our Oasis and City Trees operating costs and we do not yet exceed our Oasis and City Trees operating costs and corporate overhead. Although we believe we have funds sufficient to sustain our operations at their current level, if we require additional cash, we expect to obtain the necessary funds as described above; however, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of operations. To address these risks, we must, among other things, seek growth opportunities through additional debt and/or equity investments and acquisitions in our industry, successfully execute our business strategy, including our planned expansion and acquisitions, and successfully navigate the COVID-19 business environment in which we currently operate as well as any changes that may arise in the cannabis regulatory environment. We cannot assure that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Sales of Equity
The Canaccord Special Warrant Offering
On June 20, 2018, we executed an agency agreement with Canaccord Genuity Corp. and closed on a private offering of our Special Warrants for aggregate gross proceeds of CD$13,037,859 (USD$9,785,978). In connection therewith, we also entered into a Special Warrant Indenture and a Warrant Indenture with Odyssey Trust Company, as special warrant agent and warrant agent.
Pursuant to the offering, we issued 28,973,014 special warrants at a price of CD$0.45 (USD$0.34) per Special Warrant. Each Special Warrant was automatically exercised, for no additional consideration, into Units on November 30, 2018.
Each Unit consisted of one Unit Share and one Warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Each Warrant was to be exercisable at a price of CD$0.65 for three years after our common stock was listed on a recognized Canadian stock exchange, subject to adjustment in certain events. Because we did not receive a receipt from the applicable Canadian securities authorities for the qualifying prospectus by August 20, 2018, each Special Warrant entitled the holder to receive 1.1 Units (instead of one (1) Unit); provided, however, that any fractional entitlement to penalty units was rounded down to the nearest whole penalty unit.
In connection with the Special Warrant Offering, we paid a cash commission and other fees equal to CD$1,413,267 (USD$1,060,773), a corporate finance fee equal to 1,448,651 Special Warrants with a fair value of USD$1,413,300, and 2,317,842 Broker Warrants. Each Broker Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one unit at a price of CD$0.45 per unit for a period of 36 months from the date that our common stock is listed on a recognized Canadian stock exchange, subject to adjustment in certain events. Our common stock commenced trading on the Canadian Stock Exchange on January 7, 2019. During the year ended May 31, 2020, we also issued investors 3,042,167 Special Warrants with a fair value of $7,142,550 as a penalty for failure to timely effect a Canadian prospectus with regard to the securities underlying the Special Warrants.
The Navy Capital Investors
Effective July 31, 2018, we entered into a subscription agreement with Navy Capital Green International, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands limited company (“Navy Capital”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Navy Capital, for a purchase price of $3,000,000, 7,500,000 units ($0.40 per unit), representing (i) 7,500,000 shares of our common stock, and (ii) three-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares of our common stock (the “Navy Warrant Shares”) at an exercise price of $0.60 per share of common stock (the “Navy Capital Offering”). We valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and allocated gross proceeds in the amount of $1,913,992 to the common stock and $1,086,008 to the warrants. The closing occurred on August 6, 2018. In the subscription agreement, we also agreed to file, on or before November 1, 2018, a registration statement with the SEC registering the shares of common stock and Navy Warrant Shares issued to Navy Capital. If we failed to file the registration statement on or before that date, we were required to issue to Navy Capital an additional number of units equal to ten percent (10%) of the units originally subscribed for by Navy Capital (which would include additional warrants at the original exercise price). On August 29, 2019, we filed a registration statement with the SEC which included the shares of common stock and Navy Warrant Shares issued to Navy Capital. The warrant is exercisable from time to time, in whole or in part for three years. The warrant has anti-dilution provisions that provide for an adjustment to the exercise price in the event of a future issuance or sale of common stock at a lower price, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the warrant. As a result of the Debenture Amendment, conversion of the debentures issued in the 2018 Convertible Debenture Offering will trigger this provision and reduce the exercise price of the warrants. The warrant also provides that it is callable at any time after the bid price of our common stock exceeds 120% of the exercise price of the warrant for a period of 20 consecutive business days. This warrant expired on July 31, 2021.
Between August 8, 2018 and August 10, 2018, we entered into five subscription agreements, pursuant to which we sold, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,750,000, 6,875,000 units ($0.40 per unit), representing (i) 6,875,000 shares of our common stock, and (ii) three-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,875,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share of common stock. We valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and allocated gross proceeds in the amount of $1,670,650 to the common stock and $1,079,350 to the warrants. These warrants expired on August 7, 2021. The balance of the terms set forth in the subscription agreements are the same as the terms in the Navy Capital subscription agreement summarized above.
Oasis Cannabis Transaction
On December 4, 2017, we entered into the Acquisition Agreement, with Alternative Solutions for us to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, we paid a non-refundable deposit of $250,000 upon signing, which was followed by an additional payment of $1,800,000 approximately 45 days thereafter and were to receive, upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, an initial 10% of each of the Oasis LLCs. Regulatory approvals were received and the 10% membership interests were transferred to us.
On June 27, 2018, we closed on the purchase of the remaining 90% of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs from the owners thereof (excluding Alternative Solutions). The closing consideration was as follows: $5,995,543 in cash, a $4.0 million promissory note due in December 2019, known as the Oasis Note, and $6,000,000 in shares of our common stock. The cash payment of $5,995,543 was less than the $6,200,000 payment originally contemplated because the Company assumed an additional $204,457 of liabilities.
The number of shares to be issued was computed as follows: $6,000,000 divided by the lower of $1.00 or the conversion price to receive one share of our common stock in our first equity offering of a certain minimum size that commenced in 2018, multiplied by 80%. This price was determined to be $0.272 per share. The Oasis Note was secured by a first priority security interest over our membership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs, and by the assets of each of the Oasis LLCs and Alternative Solutions. We also delivered a confession of judgment to a representative of the former owners of Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs (other than Alternative Solutions) that would generally become effective upon an event of default under the Oasis Note or failure to pay certain other amounts when due. We repaid the Oasis Note in full in December 2019.
At the time of closing of the Acquisition Agreement, Alternative Solutions owed certain amounts to a consultant known as 4Front Advisors, which amount was in dispute. In August 2019, we made a payment to this company to settle this dispute and the Oasis Note was reduced accordingly.
The former owners of Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs (other than Alternative Solutions) became entitled to a $1,000,000 payment from us because the Oasis LLC maintained an average revenue of $20,000 per day during the 2019 calendar year. We made a payment in the amount of $850,000 to the sellers on May 27, 2020. We deposited the balance due to sellers of $150,000 with an escrow agent to hold pending the outcome of a tax audit. During the year ended May 31, 2020, the State of Nevada notified the Oasis LLCs that it would be conducting a tax audit for periods both before and after the closing of the sale to CLS. The Oasis LLCs have not yet received the demand from the State of Nevada with the precise amount due and the amount escrowed is our best estimate of the pre-closing tax liability If the ultimate tax liability is less than $150,000, the balance of the escrowed amount will be paid to sellers. As of May 31, 2020, the $150,000 remains a liability on the Company’s balance sheet and $150,000 is recorded in an escrow account in the asset section of the Company’s balance sheet.
We received final regulatory approval to own the membership interests in the Oasis LLCs on December 12, 2018. We have applied for regulatory approval to own our interest in the Oasis LLCs through Alternative Solutions, which is currently under review.
Consulting Agreements
We periodically use the services of outside investor relations consultants. During the year ended May 31, 2016, pursuant to a consulting agreement, we agreed to issue 10,000 shares of common stock per month, valued at $11,600 per month, to a consultant in exchange for investor relations consulting services. The consulting agreement was terminated during the first month of its term. The parties are in discussions regarding whether any shares of our common stock have been earned and it is uncertain whether any shares will be issued. As of May 31, 2021, we included 20,000 shares of common stock, valued at $23,200 in stock payable on the accompanying balance sheets. The shares were valued based on the closing market price on the grant date.
On December 29, 2015, pursuant to a consulting agreement, we agreed to issue 25,000 shares of common stock per month, valued at $21,250, to a consultant in exchange for investor relations consulting services. The consulting agreement was terminated during the first month of its term. The parties are in discussions regarding whether any shares of our common stock have been earned and it is uncertain whether any shares will be issued. As of May 31, 2021, we had 50,000 shares of common stock, valued at $42,500 included in stock payable on the accompanying balance sheet. The shares were valued based on the closing market price on the grant date.
On August 16, 2019, we amended a consulting agreement whereby we agreed to issue up to 200,000 shares of common stock plus pay certain amounts in exchange for the consultant’s development for us of a corporate finance and investor relations campaign, which services will be provided over a six month period. We issued 100,000 shares of common stock to this consultant in full satisfaction of this agreement before this agreement was terminated.
Going Concern
Our financial statements were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred continuous losses from operations since inception, and have an accumulated deficit of $92,736,638 as of May 31, 2021, compared to $76,846,124, as of May 31, 2020. We had a working capital deficit of $1,143,922 as of May 31, 2021, compared to working capital of $6,059,592 at May 31, 2020. The report of our independent auditors for the year ended May 31, 2021 contained a going concern qualification. Our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, and complications frequently encountered by early stage companies.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs, to borrow capital and to sell equity to support our plans to acquire operating businesses, open processing facilities and finance ongoing operations There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital and/or that cash generated by our future operations will be adequate to meet our needs. These factors, among others, indicate that we may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) are subject to change. Changes in such standards may have an impact on our future financial statements. The following are a summary of recent accounting developments.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Accounting for Leases. This update requires that lessees recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are measured at the present value of the future lease payments at lease commencement date. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will largely remain unchanged and shall continue to depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. We have performed a comprehensive review in order to determine what changes were required to support the adoption of this new standard. We adopted the ASU and related amendments on June 1, 2019 and expect to elect certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance. We elected the optional transition method that allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and will not restate prior periods. Under the new guidance, the majority of our leases will continue to be classified as operating. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed our implementation of our processes and policies to support the new lease accounting and reporting requirements. This resulted in an initial increase in both our total assets and total liabilities in the amount of $1,781,446. The adoption of this ASU has not had a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows on an ongoing basis.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues and is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within the reporting period. Adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material effect on our financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, current U.S. GAAP requires the performance of procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, the amendments under this ASU require the goodwill impairment test to be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU became effective for us on January 1, 2020. The amendments in this ASU were applied on a prospective basis. During the year ended May 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $25,185,003 pursuant to ASU No. 2017-04.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU requires that an entity account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if used), vesting conditions and classification (as equity or liability) of the modified award are all the same as for the original award immediately before the modification. The ASU became effective for us on January 1, 2018, and is applied to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options), including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification, to a scope exception.
These amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
Effective June 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue from the commercial sales of products and licensing agreements by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 605, revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the performance of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is fixed and determinable; and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. There was no impact on our financial statements as a result of adopting ASC 606.
On June 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-11 and accordingly reclassified the fair value of the reset provisions embedded in convertible notes payable and certain warrants with embedded anti-dilutive provisions from liability to equity in the aggregate amount of $1,265,751.
There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management uses various estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Accounting estimates that are the most important to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgment by management, are designated as our critical accounting estimates. We have the following critical accounting estimates:
●
Estimates and assumptions regarding the deductibility of expenses for purposes of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code: Management evaluates the expenses of its manufacturing and retail operations and makes certain judgments regarding the deductibility of various expenses under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code based on its interpretation of this regulation and its subjective assumptions about the categorization of these expenses.
●
Estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of derivative liabilities: Management utilizes a lattice model to estimate the fair value of derivative liabilities. The model includes subjective assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates.
●
Estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets. In order to value our intangible assets, management prepares multi-year projections of revenue, costs of goods sold, gross margin, operating expenses, taxes and after tax margins relating to the operations associated with the intangible assets being valued. These projections are based on the estimates of management at the time they are prepared and include subjective assumptions regarding industry growth and other matters.
