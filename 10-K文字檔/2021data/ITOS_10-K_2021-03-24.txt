Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of a new generation of highly differentiated immuno-oncology therapeutics for patients. We leverage our deep understanding of the tumor microenvironment and immunosuppressive pathways to design novel product candidates with an aim to improve the clinical benefit of oncology therapies. Our innovative pipeline includes two clinical-stage programs targeting novel, validated immuno-oncology pathways designed to build on prior learnings in the field to have differentiated pharmacological and clinical profiles. Our most advanced product candidate, inupadenant, formerly referred to as EOS-850, is designed as a highly selective small molecule antagonist of the adenosine A2a receptor, or A2AR, in the adenosine pathway, a key driver of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment across a broad range of tumors. We are investigating inupadenant in an open-label multi-arm Phase 1/2a clinical trial in adult cancer patients with advanced solid tumors and in the dose escalation portion of the trial the drug has shown encouraging preliminary single-agent activity. In addition to the single-agent cohort, we commenced dosing in the second cohort evaluating inupadenent in combination with pembrolizumab. We expect to report additional data from monotherapy expansion cohorts later in 2021. Our lead antibody product candidate, EOS-448, is an antagonist of TIGIT, an immune checkpoint with multiple mechanisms of action leading to immunosuppression. EOS-448 was also selected to engage the Fc gamma receptor, or FcγR, to activate dendritic cells and macrophages and to promote antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, activity. In 2020 we enrolled an open-label Phase 1/2a clinical trial of EOS-448 in adult cancer patients with advanced solid tumors and we will report initial safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamic data in the first half of 2021. We are using our expertise in tumor immunology to select additional targets for other novel, differentiated programs. We continue to progress research programs focused on additional targets that complement our A2AR and TIGIT programs. We are optimizing our screening and selection process to identify potential candidates and expect to nominate an additional product candidate for Investigational New Drug, of IND, enabling studies before the end of 2021. We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize all of our product candidates.
Since our inception in August 2011, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, conducting discovery and research activities, filing patent applications, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials and establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of initial quantities of our product candidates and component materials. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering (IPO). Through December 31, 2020, we had raised an aggregate of $210.6 million of net proceeds from the IPO and $177.1 million from the sale of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $336.3 million.
We have incurred recurring losses since inception. Our net losses were $38.0 million and $22.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $73.9 million. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses in connection with ongoing development activities, particularly if and as we:
•
continue preclinical studies and clinical trials and initiate new clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates;
•
advance the development of our product candidate pipeline;
•
continue research activities as we seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;
•
obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional research and development, clinical and commercial personnel;
•
scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and our transition to operating as a public company.
As a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, grants, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $336.3 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2023. Our future viability beyond that point is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “Liquidity and capital resources.” Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our programs, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates.
We are party to collaboration and license agreements pursuant to which we may be required to make future royalty and milestone payments. In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Adimab, LLC, or Adimab, pursuant to which we paid $1.0 million to exercise an option to acquire certain licenses from Adimab. One of the antibodies licensed under this agreement is what we now refer to as EOS-448. This agreement provides for potential future milestone payments up to an aggregate of $42.8 million for the first three products and additional milestone payments up to $13.5 million for each additional product. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not pursued any additional targets under the Adimab agreement that could potentially result in such milestone payments. We will also pay Adimab low to mid single-digit percentage royalties on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on worldwide net sales of licensed products. To date, we have paid a total of $3.4 million to Adimab pursuant the collaboration agreement. We are also party to a biologics master services agreement with WuXi Biologics Hong Kong Limited, or WuXi, pursuant to which we will pay WuXi, at our election, either a low single-digit percentage royalty on global net sales of manufactured products or a one-time milestone payment in the low tens of millions.
On December 10, 2019, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the MSD Agreement) with MSD International GmbH (MSD), a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Under the MSD Agreement, the Company sponsors a clinical trial in which both the Company’s compound and MSD’s compound are dosed in combination. The Company conducts the research at its own cost and MSD contributes its compound towards the study at no cost to the Company. The parties will equally own the clinical data and inventions from the study, with the exception of inventions relating solely to each party’s compound class. The MSD Agreement will expire upon the delivery of a written report on the results of the study, unless earlier terminated or agreed by the parties. The Company began receiving compounds from MSD on April 1, 2020 and the Company began the research study in the third quarter of 2020.
As of July 23, 2020, the date of our final prospectus for our IPO, further evaluation of the autopsy and etiology of a pericardial effusion that was a reported serious adverse event, or SAE, which occurred in a treated patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial of inupadenant was pending. In the case of the subject with endometroid adenocarcinoma of the cervix who experienced SAEs that were considered possibly drug-related, the final autopsy results are now available. The subject’s death due to acute right heart failure related to disease progression is not considered drug-related, and the lung findings that had been previously diagnosed as pneumonitis have been determined to be related to disease progression within the lung. There was not clear evidence that the pericardial effusion, which occurred approximately 4 weeks after treatment with inupadenant was discontinued, was considered possibly drug-related.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. In response to the rapid global spread of the virus, national, state, and local governments issued orders and recommendations to attempt to reduce the further spread of the disease. Such orders included movement control and shelter-in-place orders, travel restrictions, limitations on public gatherings, school closures, social distancing requirements and the closure of all but critical and essential services and infrastructure. The United States, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where our headquarters are located, as well as countries throughout Europe and Asia have implemented severe travel restrictions, social distancing requirements and stay-at-home orders, among other restrictions, which, in some cases, have had the effect of delaying the commencement of non-COVID-19-related clinical trials. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the U.S., regional and global economies and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets.
We have been carefully monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and have taken important steps to help ensure the safety of our employees and their families and to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the Cambridge and Belgian communities. We have established a work-from-home policy for all employees, other than those performing or supporting business-critical operations, such as certain members of our laboratory and facilities staff. For those employees, we have implemented stringent safety measures designed to comply with applicable federal, state and local guidelines instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also maintained efficient communication with our partners and clinical sites as the COVID-19 situation has progressed. We have taken these precautionary steps while maintaining business continuity so that we can continue to progress our programs. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our development timelines for inupadenant and EOS-448 and its effect on our preclinical research and development is uncertain.
While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry, the healthcare system and our current and future operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. See “Risk factors” for a discussion of the potential adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Components of our results of operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future, if at all. All of our revenue to date has been derived from licensing fees in connection with a research collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer, which terminated in 2017. We had no revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
We expect that our revenue, if any, will be less than our expenses for the foreseeable future and that we will experience increasing losses as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. Our ability to generate revenue for each product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval will depend on numerous factors, including competition, commercial manufacturing capability and market acceptance of our products.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:
•
costs to obtain licenses to intellectual property and related future payments should certain success, development and regulatory milestones be achieved;
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and independent contractors that conduct research and development, preclinical and clinical activities on our behalf;
•
costs of purchasing lab supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical activities and in manufacturing clinical study materials through CMOs;
•
consulting and professional fees related to research and development activities; and
•
facility costs, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supplies.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as preclinical studies and clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors, such as patient enrollment or clinical site activations for services received and efforts expended.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our current development programs progress and new programs are added.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, which could all be impacted by the COVID pandemic, including, but not limited to:
•
successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;
•
receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
successful completion of preclinical studies and IND-enabling studies;
•
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
•
obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity;
•
launching commercial sales of the product, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•
acceptance of a product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
•
effectively competing with other therapies and treatment options;
•
a continued acceptable safety profile following approval;
•
enforcing and defending intellectual property and proprietary rights and claims; and
•
achieving desirable medicinal properties for the intended indications.
A change in the outcome of any of these factors could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our current and future preclinical and clinical product candidates. For example, if the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development, or if we experience significant delays in execution of or enrollment in any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of preclinical and clinical development.
The following table summarizes our principal product development programs, including direct research and development expenses allocated to each clinical product candidate:
(1)
The substantial majority of these costs relate to the inupadenant and EOS-448 programs. Approximately half of these costs are payroll and related costs for our employees performing in-house research and development activities and the remainder represents other research and development costs.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, business development, facility operations and administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and fees for accounting, tax and consulting services.
Grant income
We have agreements with granting agencies whereby we receive funding under grants that partially or fully reimburse us for eligible research and development expenditures. Certain grant agreements require us to repay the funding depending on whether we decide to pursue commercial development or out-licensing of any drug candidate that is produced from the research program. The repayment provision includes portion that is fixed (corresponding to 30% of the grant), payable in annual installments, which is effective unless we decide not to pursue commercial development or out licensing of the drug candidate. The repayment provision also includes a potential obligation to pay a royalty that is contingent upon achieving sales of a product developed through the program. The maximum amount payable to the granting agency under each grant, including the fixed repayments, the royalty on revenue and the interest thereon, is twice the amount of funding received.
Research and development tax credits
Our subsidiary iTeos Belgium SA, as a Belgian biotechnology company, qualifies for a cash-based tax credit on research and development expenses. The credit is calculated based on a percentage of eligible research and development expenses defined by the Belgian government for each fiscal year (13.5% for 2020 and 2019) and then applying the effective tax rate to that result. The research and development tax credits are refundable to us if we are unable to use the credits to offset income taxes for the five subsequent tax years. We record a receivable and other income as the qualified expenses are incurred, as we are reasonably assured that the credit will be received, based upon our history of filing for the tax credits. Research and development tax credits receivable where we expect to receive refunds more than one year after the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet.
Fair value adjustment for tranche rights and warrants
Prior to March 2020, we had an obligation to issue and our investors’ had an obligation to purchase additional shares of Series B preferred stock. This obligation represented a freestanding financial instrument. In addition, prior to October 2019, the investors in Series A and B preferred stock held anti-dilution warrants, which also represented a freestanding financial instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche right and anti-dilution warrant liabilities were initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss during each period while such instruments
were outstanding. The anti-dilution warrants were settled in October 2019 in connection with our corporate reorganizations and the tranche rights were settled in the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly, we are no longer required to record liabilities for these obligations or changes in the fair value of those liabilities.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net includes income and expenses that do not fall within other categories of the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Items included are interest income, bank fees and gain or loss on foreign currency transactions.
Income taxes
Income tax expense results from foreign minimum income tax and profit on a legal entity basis. The losses that we have incurred since inception result primary from the losses of our Belgian subsidiary. As of December 31, 2020, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $69.2 million with no expiration. We also had net operating loss carryforwards of $29.2 million and $29.0 million for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. These net operating losses, along with temporary differences related primarily to capitalized R&D expenses for tax purposes in Belgium and stock-based compensation in the U.S., resulted in a net deferred tax asset of $32.0 million. We have considered that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax asset, and accordingly, established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020.
Results of operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, together with the dollar change in those items:
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses increased by $10.7 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily related to an increase of $1.2 million of payroll and related costs, a $9.5 million increase CRO/CMO fees and internal laboratory expenses, a $0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation, an increase of $0.1 million related to facilities. These increases were offset by a $0.4 million decrease in various other research and development expenses. The overall increase was due to an increase in activities related to clinical trials, with the commencement of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for EOS-448 in February 2020, as well as increased clinical activities for inupadenant, which had a full period of activity during the year ended December 31, 2020 and a partial period during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, there was an increase in spending related to our preclinical programs during the year ended December 31, 2020.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $6.5 million to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.6 million of payroll and related costs resulting from additional executives and finance and administrative employees added to enable the Company to operate as a public company and a one-time bonus related to the IPO, a $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $1.2 million for directors and officers insurance as a result of becoming a public company. In addition, there was also a $0.9 million increase related to facilities, recruiting, franchise taxes and various other general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million related to professional fees. The Company’s professional fees were higher in 2019 due to expenses incurred related to the corporate reorganization and converting the Company’s financial statements to U.S. GAAP. A large portion of the professional fees incurred in 2020 were recorded initially as deferred IPO costs and then offset against additional paid-in capital upon the closing of the IPO.
Grant income
Grant income increased by $1.7 million to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall increase in grant income, driven by spending on qualified research and development activities, was primarily attributable to an increase in grants for the following programs:
•
Inupadenant: $0.7 million
•
EOS-448: $0.8 million
•
Other preclinical programs: $0.2 million
Research and development tax credits
Research and development tax credits decreased by $0.5 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was caused by a decrease in qualifying research and development expenses in Belgium due to the re-invoicing of a portion of those costs from Belgium to the U.S. starting in 2020.
Fair value adjustment for tranche rights and warrants
As a result of changes in the fair value of the tranche right and anti-dilution warrants liabilities, we recognized other income of $1.3 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In October 2019, as part of the corporate reorganization, the anti-dilution warrants were settled and the related liability was removed from the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the tranche rights have been settled and the remaining liability has been reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
Income tax (benefit) expense
In 2020, the U.S. subsidiary generated a net operating loss, which was carried back to taxable income generated in 2019. This generated an income tax benefit for 2020. We generated income tax expense for our U.S. subsidiary in 2019 due to taxable income generated from intercompany charges between the United States and Belgium.
Liquidity and capital resources
In July 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 10,586,316 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. We received net proceeds from our IPO of $184.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. In early August 2020, we sold an additional 1,505,359 shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares for net proceeds of $26.6 million.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of our programs. To date, we
have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the IPO, the sales of preferred stock, and grants and licenses. As of December 31, 2020, we had $336.3 million in cash and cash equivalents.
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. We anticipate the need for additional capital in order to continue to fund our research and development, including our plans for clinical and preclinical trials and new product development, as well as to fund general operations. As and if necessary, we will seek to raise these additional funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through corporate collaboration and license agreements. Especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations on acceptable terms, if at all, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs. For a more detailed discussion of risks related to our COVID-19, please see Item 1A., Risk factors-Risks related to our relationships with third parties, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cash flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Net cash used in operating activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used cash in operating activities of $25.2 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $38.0 million, partially offset primarily by the non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation of $4.3 million and a decrease in grants receivable of $5.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash in operating activities of $23.1 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $22.5 million.
Net cash used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher investments in laboratory and other equipment and software during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net cash provided by financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $340.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. We raised cash through the IPO, with net proceeds of $210.6 million, and through the issuance of Series B-2 preferred stock, with net proceeds of $125.0 million. In addition, we received $4.0 million under grant programs with a potential obligation for repayment and $0.7 million from the exercise of stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $22.4 million from the issuance of Series B preferred stock under tranche 2 of the Series B subscription agreement and $0.1 million from the exercise of stock options.
Effects of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
The $1.7 million in the effects of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily caused by the increase in the euro to dollar exchange rate between
December 31, 2019 and 2020. The $0.5 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily caused by the decrease in the euro to dollar exchange rate between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.
Funding requirements
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our Phase 1/2a clinical trial of EOS-448, continue our multi-arm Phase 1/2a clinical trial of inupadenant, advance the development of pipeline programs, initiate new research and preclinical development efforts and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products. In July 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 10,586,316 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. We received net proceeds from our IPO of $184.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In early August 2020, we issued and sold an additional 1,505,359 shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares for net proceeds of $26.6 million. Going forward, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2023.
We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of inupadenant and EOS-448, and the research, development and commercialization of other potential product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of product candidates;
•
research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop;
•
our ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements;
•
the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;
•
the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;
•
the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;
•
subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our current and future product candidates;
•
our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims;
•
the costs of operating as a public company; and
•
the emergence of competing therapies and other adverse market developments.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, grants, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or grants when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual obligations
The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
(1)
We have entered into two arrangements with the Walloon Region of Belgium, whereby the Walloon Region would provide us with up to $27.4 million for our inupadenant ($23.1 million) and EOS-448 ($4.3 million) research and development programs. As of December 31, 2020, we have received $17.2 million under the inupadenant grant and $2.5 under the EOS-448 grant. We must repay 30% of the amount received under the grants in annual installments from 2022 to 2041 unless we decide not to pursue development and commercialization of the intellectual property developed arising from the program, apply for a waiver from the Walloon Region justifying our decision based upon the failure of the program, and return the intellectual property to the Walloon Region.
In addition, in the event that we receive revenue from products or services related to the intellectual property developed arising from the programs, we must pay to the Walloon Region a 0.33% royalty on revenue related to the inupadenant grant and a 0.12% royalty on revenue on the EOS-448 grant. The maximum amount payable to the Walloon Region under each grant, including the fixed annual repayments, the royalty on revenue, and the interest thereon, is twice the amount of grant received.
The table above does not include potential milestone and success fees, sublicense fees, royalty fees, licensing maintenance fees and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs that we may be required to pay under agreements we have entered into with certain institutions to license intellectual property. Our agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial and success payment milestones. We have not included such potential obligations in the table above because they are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing, likelihood and amount of such potential obligations are not known with certainty.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs and clinical sites for the conduct of clinical trials, professional consultants for expert advice and other vendors for clinical supply manufacturing or other services. These contracts are not included in the table above as they provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and do not include any minimum purchase commitments.
Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance.
We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates-which also would have been reasonable-could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Research and development expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time, which we periodically confirm with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
CROs in connection with clinical trials;
•
CMOs with respect to clinical materials, intermediates, drug substance and drug product;
•
vendors in connection with research and preclinical development activities; and
•
vendors related to manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors for goods or services will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we determine the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of subjects and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, differences may cause us to report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amounts actually incurred.
Stock-based compensation expense
Prior to our IPO in July 2020, there had been no public market for our common stock. The estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock, and our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations were prepared using an option pricing method, or OPM, which used market approaches to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred stock liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. A discount for lack
of marketability of the common stock was then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered both objective and subjective factors, including:
•
the prices at which we sold preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock relative to our common stock at the time of each grant;
•
the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of preclinical studies and planned clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
our stage of development and our business strategy;
•
external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry, and trends within the biotechnology industry;
•
our financial position, including cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;
•
the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock; and
•
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management’s best estimate, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgement. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes changed and we used significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different.
Following our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
There were no significant changes to assumptions used to value options under the Black Scholes option pricing model in 2020, with the exception of the stock and exercise prices, which increased significantly as a result of the Series B-2 preferred stock offering in March 2020 and the IPO in July 2020.
Valuation of preferred stock tranche rights
Our issuance of Series B preferred stock provided investors the right to participate in subsequent offerings of Series B preferred stock, in the event specified developmental and regulatory milestones were achieved. We classified the tranche rights as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as we determined that the tranche rights met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument since they were legally detachable. We also determined that such instruments represented forward sale contracts on redeemable shares and, accordingly, the instrument should be accounted for as a liability separate from the convertible preferred stock. We remeasured the liabilities associated with tranche rights to fair value at each reporting date, and immediately prior to exercise or settlement, and recognized the change in the fair value of the liabilities in our consolidated statements of operations recorded as “fair value adjustment for preferred stock tranche rights and anti-dilution warrants.”
The fair value of the liabilities was determined using a probability-weighted scenario analysis utilizing the underlying preferred stock. The liabilities were valued as forward contracts, which considered inputs including, but not limited to, the probability of attaining the milestones, the expected timing of meeting the milestones, market-based assumptions for expected term and the risk free rate. Changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the tranche right liabilities.
Government grant funding and potential repayment commitments under recoverable cash advance grants (RCAs)
We have agreements with granting agencies whereby we receive funding under grants, which partially or fully reimburse us for eligible research and development expenditures. Certain grant agreements require us to repay the funding wherein the repayment provision of the grants are predicated on whether we decide to pursue commercial development or out licensing of the drug candidate that is produced from the results of the research program. The repayment provision includes a portion that is fixed (corresponding to 30% of the grant) which is effective after we decide to pursue commercial development or out licensing of the drug candidate. The repayment provision also includes a potential obligation to pay a royalty that is contingent upon achieving sales of a product developed through the program. The maximum amount payable to the granting agency under each
grant, including the fixed repayments, the royalty on revenue, and the interest thereon, is twice the amount of funding received.
Grant funding for research and development received under grant agreements where there is a repayment provision is recognized as other income to the extent there is no potential obligation to repay this funding. We record the present value of the liability as a grant repayable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The grant repayable is subsequently recorded at amortized cost. There were no significant changes in assumptions in 2020. The increase in the amount of grants repayable recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was driven by more cash received with a fixed repayment obligation in 2020 compared to 2019.
Recent accounting pronouncements
Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Emerging growth company and smaller reporting company status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards at the time private companies adopt the new or revised accounting standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We have, however, elected to early-adopt certain new or revised accounting standards as of dates that may or may not coincide with the effective dates of private companies.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
