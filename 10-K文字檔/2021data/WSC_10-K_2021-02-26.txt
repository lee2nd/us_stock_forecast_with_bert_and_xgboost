ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. ("WillScot Mobile Mini"), formerly known as WillScot Corporation ("WillScot"), our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The discussion of results of operations in this MD&A is presented on a historical basis, as of or for the year ended December 31, 2020 or prior periods. As the Merger was completed on July 1, 2020, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” “Company” and “WillScot Mobile Mini” means WillScot and its subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to July 1, 2020 (prior to the Merger) and to WillScot Mobile Mini and its subsidiaries when referring to periods on or after July 1, 2020 (after the Merger).
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (“GAAP”). We use certain non-GAAP financial information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the performance of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are provided in the Other Non-GAAP Financial Data and Reconciliations section.
Executive Summary
We are a leading business services provider specializing in innovative flexible work space and portable storage solutions. We service diverse end markets across all sectors of the economy throughout the United States ("US"), Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom ("UK"). We are also a leading provider of specialty containment solutions in the US with over 12,500 tank and pump units in our fleet. As of December 31, 2020, our branch network included approximately 275 branch locations and additional drop lots to service our over 85,000 customers. We offer our customers an extensive selection of “Ready to Work” modular space and portable storage solutions with over 157,000 modular space units and over 197,000 portable storage units in our fleet.
We primarily lease, rather than sell, our modular and portable storage units to customers, which results in a highly diversified and predictable recurring revenue stream. Over 90% of new lease orders are on our standard lease agreement, pre-negotiated master lease or national account agreements. The initial lease periods vary, and our leases are customarily renewable on a month-to-month basis after their initial term. Our lease revenue is highly predictable due to its recurring nature and the underlying stability and diversification of our lease portfolio. However, given that our customers value flexibility, they consistently extend their leases or renew on a month-to-month basis such that the average effective duration of our lease portfolio, is 32 months. We complement our core leasing business by selling both new and used units, allowing us to leverage scale, achieve purchasing benefits and redeploy capital employed in our lease fleet.
We remain focused on our core priorities of growing leasing revenues by increasing units on rent, both organically and through our consolidation strategy, delivering “Ready to Work” solutions to our customers with value added products and services ("VAPS"), and on continually improving the overall customer experience.
The year ended December 31, 2020 was another transformational year for WillScot Mobile Mini as we completed the Merger with Mobile Mini on July 1, 2020 at which time Mobile Mini became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WillScot. Concurrent with the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, key drivers of our financial performance included:
•Total revenues increased by $303.9 million, or 28.6%, attributable to the addition of Mobile Mini's revenues to our consolidated results once the Merger closed on July 1, 2020.
•Leasing revenue increased $257.2 million, or 34.6%, delivery and installation revenue increased $54.1 million, or 24.6%, rental unit sales decreased $1.4 million, or 3.5%, and new sales revenue decreased $6.0 million, or 10.2%.
Key leasing revenue drivers include:
-Average modular space units on rent increased 7,844 units, or 8.6%, and average portable storage units on rent increased 67,270 units, or 398.6%. Both increases were primarily driven by the Mobile Mini Merger.
-Average modular space monthly rental rate increased $44, or 7.2%, to $658 driven by a $71, or 11.6% increase in the NA Modular segment, offset partially by the dilutive impact of lower rates due to mix on the Mobile Mini modular space units.
-Average portable storage monthly rental rate increased $12, or 10.0%, to $132 driven primarily by the accretive impact of higher rates from the Mobile Mini portable storage fleet.
-Average utilization for modular space units decreased 180 basis points ("bps") to 70.2% and average utilization for portable storage units increased to 75.9%, or 10.1 percentage points, driven by higher utilization of the Mobile Mini portable storage units.
•NA Modular segment revenue, which represents the activities of WillScot prior to the Merger and represented 76.9% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased $12.5 million, or 1.2%, to $1,051.2 million driven by decreased sales volumes of $26.6 million, or 26.8%, and a $12.0 million, or 5.5%, reduction in delivery and installation revenues as a result of reductions in demand for new project deliveries. However, these reductions were partially offset by an increase in leasing revenue of $26.1 million, or 3.5%, due to continued growth of pricing and value-added products. NA Modular revenue drivers for the year ended December 31, 2020 include:
-Modular space average monthly rental rate of $685 for the year, increased 11.6% representing a continuation of the long-term price optimization initiative and VAPS penetration opportunities across our portfolio.
-Average modular space units on rent for the year decreased 4,808 units, or 5.2% driven by lower deliveries, including reduced demand for new project deliveries as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Average modular space units on rent dropped 0.5% sequentially from Q3 into Q4 to 86,011, which compares to a 1.3% drop from Q3 to Q4 in 2019, as delivery volumes returned to prior year levels and return volumes remained lower than 2019 levels.
-Average modular space monthly utilization decreased 310 basis points to 68.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020, but only dropped 10 basis points sequentially from Q3 into Q4.
•Generated consolidated net income of $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, represented an increase of $83.4 million, and included a $42.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to our recent financing activities and $93.8 million of discrete costs expensed in the period related to transaction and integration activities, partly offset by a $51.5 million non-cash income tax benefit. Discrete costs in the period included $64.1 million of Merger transaction costs, $18.3 million of integration costs, and $11.4 million of restructuring costs, lease impairment expense and other related charges. As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the $51.5 million income tax benefit was primarily driven by the reversal of $54.6 million of the federal valuation allowance and certain state valuation allowances during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the Merger, which partly offset these other discrete costs.
•Generated Adjusted EBITDA of $530.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing an increase of $173.8 million, or 48.8%, as compared to 2019. Of this increase, $135.5 million was driven by the addition of Mobile Mini to our consolidated results and the remainder was driven by strong organic growth in our NA Modular segment.
-Adjusted EBITDA in our NA Modular segment, which represents the activities of WillScot prior to the Merger, increased $38.3 million, or 10.7% primarily driven by increases in leasing gross profit driven by increased pricing, including VAPS, and significant cost reductions both from acquisition synergy realization and actions taken to reduce variable costs in a reduced demand environment during the second and third quarters of 2020.
-Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 38.8% and increased 530 bps versus prior year driven by a 410 bps increased in the NA Modular segment, as well as the addition of the higher margin Mobile Mini operations.
•Generated Free Cash Flow of $162.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing an increase of $142.3 million as compared to 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $132.2 million to $304.8 million. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities, excluding cash acquired from the Merger, decreased $10.0 million as a result of reduced capital spending needs across all segments given reduced demand for new project deliveries. Excluding the impact of $64.1 million of Merger transaction costs paid during the year, we generated $226.3 million of free cash flow for year ended December 31, 2020 and have repaid approximately $162.4 million of the 2020 ABL Facility since the Merger that closed on July 1, 2020. This was possible due to our resilient lease revenues and strong margin expansion and capex reductions across the NA Modular, NA Storage, and UK segments, as well as reduced interest costs due to our financing activity during the year. Free cash flow increased sequentially to $87.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, including $7.4 million of integration costs, which is the best indicator of our run-rate heading into 2021.
In addition to using GAAP financial measurements, we use Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in "Item 6. Selected Financial Data."
Recent Developments
Refer to the Recent Developments section in Part I, Item 1, Business, herein for further information about the Mobile Mini Merger and certain related financing transactions and the impact of COVID-19 on our business.
Business Environment and Outlook
Our customers operate in a diversified set of end markets, including construction, commercial and industrial, retail and wholesale trade, education, energy and natural resources, government and healthcare. We track several market leading indicators in order to predict demand, including those related to our two largest end markets, the commercial and industrial sector and the construction sector, which collectively accounted for approximately 85% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020. Market fundamentals underlying these end markets were impacted in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in delivery volume declines, primarily in the second and third quarters, in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") in the US, where the majority of our revenues are generated, is estimated to have declined by over 2% in 2020, and estimates from Dodge Data & Analytics suggest that non-residential construction square footage starts in the US declined by over 15% as compared to 2019. Based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indications, we expect modest market recovery in 2021 following the declines experienced in 2020, and expect both GDP and non-residential construction square footage starts in the US to grow 2-3% in 2021.
Core to our operating model is the ability to redeploy standardized assets across end markets, and we have recently serviced emerging demand in the healthcare and government sectors related to COVID-19, as well as expanded space requirements related to social distancing. Current improving market conditions, potential market catalysts such as increased infrastructure spending, and idiosyncratic growth levers such as continued penetration of our customer base with our VAPS offering, long-term pricing tailwinds, cross-selling between our Modular and Storage segment customers, and other commercial best practice sharing between our segments provide us confidence in our continued organic growth outlook.
Our Business and Growth Strategies
We will maintain a leading market position and continue pursuing the following strategies, all of which we have demonstrated in our historical results and are contributing to our growth, expanding profitability and free cash flow, and overall growth in return on invested capital:
Optimize Pricing Across Fleet
We continue to advance multiple pricing strategies across our fleet to drive revenue growth. Leveraging our expertise developed in NA Modular, we plan to implement dynamic pricing, customer segmentation, and contract standardization in our other segments. Our long history of success, demonstrated by 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit rate growth as of December 31, 2020 in the U.S. within our NA Modular segment, gives us confidence that we can successfully deploy this strategy. The turnover of our fleet, with average lease durations of nearly three years, creates natural and recurring opportunities to capture incremental price increases. As the market leader in our industry, with an estimated 45% market share in the modular sector and 25% market share in the storage sector, we offer the broadest fleet portfolio, the most differentiated turnkey VAPS, and the most consistent service capabilities across the largest branch network to help our customers be 'Ready to Work'.
Expand Penetration of Value-Added Products and Services
As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that we have over $150 million of annual organic revenue growth opportunity as the average VAPS rate of our units on rent in our NA Modular segment converges over time to the VAPS price and penetration levels achieved on our most recently delivered units, and as we begin to cross-sell this offering into our NA Storage segment ground level office fleet. We believe this growth opportunity could be substantially larger if we successfully penetrate more of our modular space orders, and expand our VAPS offering for portable storage units.
Enhance Cross-Selling Between Segments
The combination of WillScot and Mobile Mini created a leading business services provider specializing in innovative flexible work space and portable storage solutions. At the outset of the merger, we recognized that there was 80% end-market overlap and 40% customer overlap, a clear strategic opportunity for our complementary product lines. By offering a combined product suite, we simplify our customers' procurement needs and enable productivity from start to finish for projects. We believe cross-selling will also increase utilization and yield of our combined fleet. Our sales force is optimally positioned to improve efficiency by leveraging our management information systems and using real-time information to monitor and optimize conversion of customer opportunities across our core segments. In turn, we expect that our broadened and enhanced fleet will attract new customers, increase customer retention, and increase margins and return on invested capital.
Generate Cash Flow Through Operational Efficiencies, Cost Reductions, and Technology
We are implementing many initiatives designed to improve operations and increase profitability. We continually assess our branch operating footprint, vendor base, and operating structure to maximize revenue generation while minimizing costs. The Merger provides us with increased scale, numerous operational best practices from both the legacy WillScot and legacy Mobile Mini businesses, and a state-of-the-art SAP ERP platform, all of which we believe will significantly improve the operating efficiency of the combined businesses. We have a proven track record of efficiently integrating acquisitions and quickly eliminating operational redundancies while maintaining acquired customer relationships.
Deploy Capital to Strategically Support Organic Growth and Optimize Returns
We maintain a disciplined focus on our return on capital and the Merger allows us to invest opportunistically across multiple attractive asset classes prioritizing our investments to where we see the strongest potential returns. We continually assess both our existing lease fleet and customer demand for opportunities to deploy capital more efficiently. We manage our maintenance capex and growth capex to align with the economic conditions in which we operate. Within our existing lease fleet, we examine the potential cash and earnings generation of an asset sale versus continuing to lease the asset. In addition, we examine the relative benefits of organic expansion opportunities versus expansion through acquisition to obtain a favorable return on capital.
Leverage Scale and Organic Initiatives with Accretive Acquisitions
Our markets for modular space and portable storage solutions are fragmented. We estimate that approximately 55% of the modular market and approximately 75% of the portable storage market in North America are supplied by regional and local competitors. We have the broadest network of operating branches in North America, as well as a scalable corporate center and information technology systems, which position us to continue to acquire and integrate other companies while expanding the products and services available and offered to acquired customers. Furthermore, we have realized over $60 million of cost synergies from acquisitions in the past three years and have identified nearly $60 million of additional cost reductions that we have yet to execute. We expect to pursue acquisitions opportunistically that will provide further scale efficiencies and allow us to improve returns generated by the acquired assets. We continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to ensure that our operations remain in line with our broader strategic goals.
Use Free Cash Flow to Drive Value Creation
Free cash flow generation has accelerated rapidly in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue as we execute our strategy. While we see numerous organic and inorganic opportunities to re-invest in our core businesses, we believe we can generate surplus free cash flow with which we can both reduce leverage and return capital to shareholders over time. We view this as an additional powerful value creation lever, and we are committed to deploying this capital as productively as possible in the interests of our shareholders.
Components of Our Consolidated Historical Results of Operations
Revenue
Our revenue consists mainly of leasing, services and sales revenue. We derive our leasing and services revenue primarily from the leasing of modular space and portable storage units. Included in leasing revenue are VAPS, such as furniture, steps, ramps, basic appliances, internet connectivity devices, and other items our customers use in connection with our products. Delivery and installation revenue includes fees that we charge for the delivery, site work, installation, disassembly, unhooking and removal, and other services to our customers for an additional fee as part of our leasing and sales operations.
The key drivers of changes in our leasing revenue are:
•the number of units in our lease fleet;
•the average utilization rate of our lease units; and
•the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS.
The average utilization rate of our lease units is the ratio of (i) the average number of units in use during a period (which includes units from the time they are leased to a customer until the time they are returned to us) to (ii) the average total number of units available for lease in our fleet during a period. Our average monthly rental rate per unit for a period is equal to the ratio of (i) our rental income for that period including VAPS but excluding delivery and installation services and other leasing-related revenues, to (ii) the average number of lease units rented to our customers during that period.
The table below sets forth the average number of units on rent in our lease fleet, the average utilization of our lease units, and the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS:
In addition to leasing revenue, we also generate revenue from sales of new and used modular space and portable storage units to our customers, as well as delivery, installation, maintenance, removal services and other incidental items related to accommodation services for our customers. Included in our sales revenue are charges for modifying or customizing sales equipment to customers’ specifications.
Gross Profit
We define gross profit as the difference between total revenues and cost of revenues. Cost of revenues associated with our leasing business includes payroll and payroll-related costs for branch operations personnel, material and other costs related to the repair, maintenance, storage and transportation of rental equipment. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation expense associated with our rental equipment. Cost of revenues associated with our new unit sales business includes the cost to purchase, assemble, transport and customize units that are sold. Cost of revenues for our rental unit sales consist primarily of the net book value of the unit at date of sale.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense includes all costs associated with our selling efforts, including marketing costs, marketing salaries and benefits, as well as the salary and commissions of sales personnel. It also includes the leasing of facilities we occupy, professional fees and information systems, our overhead costs, such as salaries of management, administrative and corporate personnel, and integration costs associated with acquisitions and business combinations.
Transaction Costs
Transaction costs include discrete expenses incurred related to the Merger and the 2018 acquisition of ModSpace.
Other Depreciation and Amortization
Other depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of our property, plant and equipment, as well as the amortization of our intangible assets.
Impairment Losses on Long-Lived Assets
We recognize property, plant, and equipment impairment charges when an indicator of impairment is present and the carrying value of assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows and fair value of the assets.
Lease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges
Lease impairment expense and other related charges include impairment of right-of-use ("ROU") assets, gain or loss on the exit of a leased property generally associated with lease termination payments and rent expense for locations which have been closed but have not been abandoned or impaired.
Restructuring Costs
Restructuring costs include charges associated with exit or disposal activities that meet the definition of restructuring under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (“ASC 420”). Our restructuring plans are generally country or region specific and are typically completed within a one-year period. Prior to the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases ("ASC 842") effective January 1, 2019, restructuring costs incurred under these plans included (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and, (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities including, but not limited to, costs for consolidating or closing facilities. After the adoption of ASC 842, restructuring costs include one-time termination benefits related to employee separation costs. The restructuring costs incurred in 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily relate to the integration of our acquisitions. Costs related to the integration of acquired businesses that do not meet the definition of restructuring under ASC 420, such as employee training costs, duplicate facility costs, and professional services expenses, are included within SG&A expense.
Currency (Gains) Losses, Net
Currency (gains) losses, net include unrealized and realized gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than our functional currency at the reporting date.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily consists of the gain (loss) on disposal of non-operational property, plant and equipment, other financing related costs and other non-recurring charges.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of the costs of external debt including the Company’s ABL credit facility, 2022 Secured Notes, 2023 Secured Notes, 2025 Secured Notes, 2028 Secured Notes, and the senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2023 (the "Unsecured Notes") and interest on obligations under finance leases.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
In connection with the Merger and related financing transactions in 2020, using proceeds from the 2025 Secured Notes, we redeemed all of our 2022 Secured Notes. We also completed a private offering of our 2028 Secured Notes in August 2020 and used the offering proceeds to repay our 2023 Secured Notes. As a result of these transactions, we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt.
Income Tax Benefit
We are subject to income taxes in the US, Canada, Mexico and the UK. Our overall effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, such as the relative amounts of income we earn in differing tax jurisdictions, tax law changes, and certain non-deductible expenses such as compensation disallowance. The rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, such as legislative enactments. These discrete items may not be consistent from year to year. Income tax expense (benefit), deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Our consolidated statements of net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are presented below. The below results only include results from Mobile Mini and ModSpace for the periods subsequent to their acquisition dates and do not include any incremental unrealized cost savings, revenue growth, or pro forma adjustments that management expects to result from the integration of the acquired businesses.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue: Total revenue increased $303.9 million, or 28.6%, to $1,367.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,063.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven primarily by the addition of Mobile Mini's revenues to our consolidated results. The Merger closed on July 1, 2020 and drove $316.5 million of the year over year increase. Leasing revenue increased $257.2 million, or 34.6%, as compared to the same period in 2019 driven by an increase of 75,114 average modular space and portable storage units on rent as a result of the Merger, and improved pricing and value-added products in our NA Modular segment. Delivery and installation revenues increased $54.1 million, or 24.6%, due to increased overall activity as a result of the Merger, but was partially offset by lower delivery volumes due to the impact of new project cancellations and delays in the second and third quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. New unit sales decreased $6.0 million, or 10.2%, and rental unit sales decreased $1.4 million, or 3.5%, as a result of lower demand in 2020.
Total average modular space and portable storage units on rent for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 183,674 and 108,560, respectively. The increase was due primarily to the units acquired as part of the Merger, partially offset by lower delivery volumes in the NA Modular segment, including reduced demand for new projects as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic disruption on social and business activities. In total, modular space average units on rent increased 7,844 units, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 7.2% to $658 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Improved pricing was driven by a continuation of the long-term price optimization and VAPS penetration opportunities across our portfolio, partially offset by the dilutive impact of lower rates on the Mobile Mini modular space units due to product mix. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 67,270 units, or 398.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average portable storage monthly rental rates of $132 represented an increase of $12, or 10.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by the accretive impact of higher rates from the Mobile Mini portable storage fleet. The average modular space unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 70.2%, as compared to 72.0% during the same period in 2019. This decrease was driven by lower demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher utilization on units acquired as part of the Merger. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 75.9%, as compared to 65.8% during the same period in 2019. The increase in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by higher utilization on the acquired Mobile Mini units.
Gross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 48.3% and 38.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation ("adjusted gross profit percentage"), was 62.9% and 55.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Gross profit increased $246.7 million, or 59.7%, to $660.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $243.0 million increase in leasing gross profit, increased delivery and installation gross profit of $28.1 million, and increased new and rental unit sale margins of $1.5 million. These increases were primarily a result of increased revenues due to the Merger and to favorable average monthly rental rates in the NA Modular segment on modular space units, as well as modular leasing cost savings due to lower delivery volumes that were achieved as a result of actions we took to scale back variable labor and material costs in response to lower demand for new project deliveries. These increases were offset partially by lower delivery and installation activity volumes in the NA Modular segment in the second and third quarters of 2020 due to reduced delivery demand and by increased depreciation of $25.9 million as a result of fleet acquired in the Merger and capital investments made over the past twelve months in our existing rental equipment.
SG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $89.6 million, or 33.1%, to $360.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $271.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver of the increase is related to additional SG&A expense as a result of operating a larger business due to the Merger. SG&A expense for the NA Storage, UK Storage, and Tank and Pump segments totaled $90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Transaction Costs: Transaction costs increased $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Transaction costs were related to the Merger.
Other Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization increased $30.8 million, or 248.4%, to $43.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. $18.2 million of the increase was driven by increased Other depreciation as a result of the inclusion of Mobile Mini beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and $13.4 million was driven by the amortization of the customer relationship intangible asset acquired in the Merger.
Impairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the valuation of properties classified as assets held for sale as a result of the ModSpace acquisition. No similar impairments occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Lease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges: Lease impairment expense and other related charges were $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Lease impairment expense and other related charges of $3.8 million in 2020 is a result of fewer remaining closed locations in 2020 due to successful lease exits related to the ModSpace acquisition.
Restructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The restructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2020 were
primarily due to employee terminations costs as a result of the Merger and, to a lesser extent, reductions in force across our branch network in response to COVID-19 economic conditions. The restructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2019 related primarily to employee termination costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and integrations.
Currency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net decreased by $0.3 million to a $0.4 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a $0.7 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in currency (gains) losses, net, are primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currency.
Other Income, Net: Other income, net was $1.7 million and $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other income, net of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to the reversal of non-operating liabilities of $2.5 million. Other income, net of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven primarily by the receipt of $3.2 million of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey.
Interest Expense: Interest expense decreased $2.6 million, or 2.1%, to $119.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by lower interest rates on our ABL facilities, the repayment of our 10% Unsecured Notes in 2019 and the lower interest rates on our 2025 Secured Notes and 2028 Secured Notes, partially offset by an $800 million increase in debt outstanding as a result of the Merger.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt: As a result of the Merger and the related financing transactions, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $42.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This loss on extinguishment of debt was comprised of the redemption premium and write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the following: (i) $15.2 million due to the redemption of the 2022 Secured Notes, (ii) $22.7 million due to the redemption of the 2023 Secured Notes, and (iii) $4.4 million associated with the 2017 ABL Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $8.8 million of losses on extinguishment of debt consisting of $1.5 million related to the $30 million redemption of the 2022 Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103% and $7.2 million related to the redemption of the 2023 senior unsecured notes at a redemption price of 102.0%, plus a make-whole premium of 1.1%, for total premiums of 3.1%.
Income Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit increased $49.3 million to a $51.5 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a $2.2 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in income tax benefit was driven by a reversal of our valuation allowance of $56.5 million based on our assessment of deferred tax assets, a reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $11.2 million, partially offset by tax expense from pre-tax income and non-deductible expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to discrete benefits recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Revenue: Total revenue increased $312.3 million, or 41.6%, to $1,063.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of a 43.3% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as, increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 42.4% due to increased transaction volumes and higher revenues per transaction. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and average modular space units on rent increased 21,425 units, or 30.5%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as, by continued growth in our “Ready to Work” solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of $5.5 million, or 10.3%, in new unit sales as compared to 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition. Rental unit sales increased $15.3 million, or 61.2%, as compared to 2018.
Total average units on rent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 108,560 and 85,737, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, with modular space average units on rent increased by 21,425 units, or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 1,398 units, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 72.0%, as compared to 71.6% in 2018. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size across the combined WillScot and ModSpace fleet in 2019. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 65.8%, as compared to 68.9% in 2018. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.
Gross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.9% and 38.5% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation ("adjusted gross profit percentage"), was 55.3% and 54.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross profit increased $123.9 million, or 42.8%, to $413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $291.5 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $0.2 million, offset by increases of $120.2 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units and increased delivery and installation margins driven primarily by higher pricing per transaction. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation of $53.3 million as a result of additional rental equipment acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as continued capital investment in our existing rental equipment.
SG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $16.1 million, or 6.3%, to $271.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Employee costs increased $19.5 million driven by the increased size of the workforce, offset partially by employee savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities; and occupancy costs increased $10.3 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots, including a portion of the expected cost savings as we have now exited approximately 85% of redundant real estate locations.
Discrete items included in SG&A expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $17.7 million as decreases in transaction and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $20.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
The remaining increases of $4.0 million are primarily related to increased professional fees, insurance, computer, travel, office and other expenses related to operating a larger business as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.
We estimate incremental cost synergies of approximately $36.0 million related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions were realized in 2019, which compares to approximately $6.4 million of synergies realized in 2018 related to the Acton and Onsite Space LLC (d/b/a Tyson Onsite (“Tyson”) acquisitions, bringing cumulative synergies related to the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions from the dates of the acquisitions to December 31, 2019 to approximately $42.4 million. These cost synergies are consistent with our integration plans and we expect to achieve annual recurring cost savings of over $70.0 million once our integration plans are fully executed and in our annual results.
Transaction Costs: Transaction costs decreased $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Transaction costs in 2018 were related to the ModSpace acquisition that closed on August 15, 2018.
Other Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization decreased $0.9 million, or 6.8%, to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other depreciation and amortization was driven primarily by lower depreciation as a result of the decrease in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment decreased as a result of the transfer of non-producing branches to assets held for sale which are no longer depreciated and the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 which resulted in the reversal of branch assets previously accounted for as failed sale-lease back locations which are compliant sales under ASC 842.
Impairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019 and 2018, we reclassified certain branch facilities from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale and recognized an impairment on these assets as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the facilities.
Lease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges: Lease impairment expense and other related charges was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective January 1,2019, in connection with the adoption of ASC 842, we recorded $4.2 million in ROU asset impairments, $2.6 million in rent on closed locations and $1.9 million in lease termination fees.
Restructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2019 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination costs as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and integration. The 2018 restructuring charges are comprised of employee termination and lease breakage costs related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and integrations. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1. 2019, the costs associated with leases exited as a result of a restructuring plan were recorded in restructuring expense.
Currency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net were a $0.7 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a $2.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in currency losses was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currency.
Other Income, Net: Other income, net was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other income was driven by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey and other settlements which contributed $5.6 million to other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by the receipt of $2.4 million in insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during hurricanes and the receipt of a $0.9 million settlement during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest Expense: Interest expense increased $24.1 million, or 24.5%, to $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense is attributable to the increased financing costs for the full year in 2019, as a result of the ModSpace acquisition which occurred in the third quarter of 2018, offset in part by the one-time bridge financing and upfront commitment fees expensed in 2018 and lower interest costs due to the redemption of our Unsecured Notes in June 2019. In the third quarter of 2018, as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, we upsized our 2017 ABL Facility to $1.425 billion, issued the 2023 Secured Notes, and issued the Unsecured Notes and incurred bridge financing fees and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million which were recorded to interest expense.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt: $1.5 million related to the $30 million redemption on December 13, 2019 of the 2022 Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103% and $7.2 million related to the redemption on June 19, 2019 of the 2023 senior unsecured notes. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 11 for further information.
Income Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit decreased $36.4 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in tax benefit was driven by the lower loss before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately $17.0 million less tax benefit, and discrete tax benefits in 2018 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance, tax benefit of $11.9 million, and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to a change in the Company asserting indefinite re-investment in certain of its foreign businesses.
Business Segments
As a result of the Merger, we evaluated our operating structure and, accordingly, our segment structure and determined we operate in four reportable segments as follows: NA Modular, NA Storage, UK Storage and Tank and Pump. The NA Modular segment represents the activities of WillScot prior to the Merger. The NA Storage, UK Storage and Tank and Pump segments align to the three segments reported by Mobile Mini prior to the Merger.
The following tables and discussion summarize our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Consistent with the presentation of our consolidated financial statements, the below segment results only include results from ModSpace and Mobile Mini for the periods subsequent to the respective acquisition and Merger and do not include any unrealized incremental cost savings, revenue growth or pro forma adjustments that management expects to result from the integration of the acquired and merged businesses.
A Summary Business Segment Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information section has been included in this MD&A in order to provide period over period comparable financial information for the NA Storage, UK Storage and Tank and Pump reporting segments, as these segments were not included in our 2019 reported results.
Business Segment Results
Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
NA Modular Segment
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue: Total revenue decreased $12.5 million, or 1.2%, to $1,051.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,063.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by declines in new unit sales revenue, which decreased $17.2 million, or 29.1%, compared to 2019, and by declines in rental unit sales revenue, which decreased $9.4 million, or 23.3%. Additionally, delivery and installation revenues declined $12.0 million, or 5.5%, driven by lower delivery volumes related to the impact of new project cancellations and delays as a result of COVID-19 global pandemic disruption on social and business activities. These declines were partially offset by an increase in leasing revenue of $26.1 million, or 3.5%. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $685 driven by continuation of the long-term price optimization and VAPS penetration opportunities across our portfolio. Improved pricing was partially offset by lower volumes as average modular space units on rent decreased by 4,808 units, or 5.2% year over year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower delivery volumes, including reduced demand for new projects since mid- March of 2020 as a result of COVID-19.
Gross Profit: Gross profit increased $38.3 million, or 9.3%, to $451.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross profit was driven by a $44.9 million increase in leasing gross profit driven by improved pricing and VAPS, as well as by lower modular leasing cost due to lower delivery demand in the second and third quarter of 2020 and reduced variable costs. The increase in gross profit from leasing revenues was partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in depreciation of rental equipment primarily as a result of capital investments made over the past twelve months in our existing rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $38.3 million, or 10.7%, to $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by higher leasing
gross profits discussed above, partially offset by increases in SG&A, excluding discrete and other items, of $6.8 million. SG&A increases were primarily related to increases in occupancy and office costs, insurance costs, and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by decreased travel and entertainment costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Capex for rental equipment: Capex for rental equipment decreased $51.8 million, or 25.3%, to $153.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $205.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net CAPEX also decreased $31.3 million, or 20.5%, to $121.3 million. The decreases for both were driven by decreased spend for refurbishments and VAPS due to less constrained fleet and reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cost improvements experienced over the prior year related to better unit selection and scoping on refurbishments. Decrease to Net CAPEX was also partially driven by lower demand for sales of rental units.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Revenue: Total revenue increased $312.3 million, or 41.6%, to $1,063.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of a 43.3% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as, increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 42.4% due to increased transaction volumes and higher revenues per transaction. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and average modular space units on rent increased 21,425 units, or 30.5%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as, by continued growth in our “Ready to Work” solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of $5.5 million, or 10.3%, in new unit sales as compared to 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition. Rental unit sales increased $15.3 million, or 61.2%, as compared to 2018.
Total average units on rent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 108,560 and 85,737, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, with modular space average units on rent increased by 21,425 units, or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 1,398 units, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 72.0%, as compared to 71.6% in 2018. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size across the combined WillScot and ModSpace fleet in 2019. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 65.8%, as compared to 68.9% in 2018. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.
Gross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.9% and 38.5% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation ("adjusted gross profit percentage"), was 55.3% and 54.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross profit increased $123.9 million, or 42.8%, to $413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $291.5 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $0.2 million, offset by increases of $120.2 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units and increased delivery and installation margins driven primarily by higher pricing per transaction.

Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $141.0 million, or 65.4%, to $356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $215.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher revenues and gross profits discussed above excluding depreciation, partially offset by increases in SG&A expense, excluding discrete items, of $33.8 million primarily related to the acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace during the year. Discrete items included in SG&A expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $17.7 million as decreases in transaction and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $20.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The remaining increases of $4.0 million are primarily related to increased professional fees, insurance, computer, travel, office and other expenses related to operating a larger business as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.
Capex for rental equipment: Capex for rental equipment increased $44.2 million, or 27.5%, to $205.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by
increased spend for new units, VAPS, and refurbishments as a result of the increased fleet size due to the Acton, Tyson and ModSpace acquisitions. During the year, our average modular space unit fleet grew over 30% in 2019 as compared to 2018.

Summary Business Segment Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information
As a result of the Merger and the significant related financing transactions, we believe presenting supplemental pro forma financial information is beneficial to the readers of the financial statements. The following table sets forth key metrics used by management to run the business on a pro forma basis as if the Merger and related financing transactions had occurred on January 1, 2019. Refer to the Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information section below for the full reconciliation of the statements of operations.
Following the Merger, we modified our management structure and expanded from two reporting segments to four segments: NA Modular, NA Storage, UK Storage and Tank and Pump. Prior to the Merger, WillScot had two reportable segments, US Modular and Other North America Modular. These two segments were combined to create the new NA Modular segment, which represents the legacy WillScot operations. The other new segments, NA Storage, UK Storage, and Tank and
Pump align to the legacy operations and segments reported by Mobile Mini. The new reporting segments are aligned with how we operate and analyze our business results.

Pro Forma Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
NA Storage
Revenue: Total revenue increased $2.7 million, or 0.6%, to $418.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $415.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Leasing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased year-over-year by $4.8 million, or 1.6%, resulting from the combination of increased revenues in the first quarter, decreased year-over-year revenue in the second quarter due to the impact of COVID-19, flat year-over-year revenue in the third quarter and increased revenues in the fourth quarter, when compared to the prior-year periods. Modular space average units on rent increased 1.7% compared to 2019 and average modular space monthly rental rates increased 10.0% year-over-year but were offset by a 2.3% decrease in average portable storage units on rent. Delivery and installation revenues decreased $7.3 million year-over year. Beginning late in the first quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in fewer new units placed on rent as well as a decrease in returned units leading to a year-over-year decrease in our delivery and installation revenues. Sales revenues increased $5.1 million compared to the prior year.
Gross Profit: Gross profit increased $5.9 million, or 2.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $294.8 million from $288.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This gross profit increase was driven primarily by a $6.8 million, or 2.5%, year-over-year increase within leasing and a $1.3 million increase related to sales, offset by decreased delivery and installation gross profit of $1.5 million. Within leasing activity, reduced expenses of $2.0 million from strong cost management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the $4.8 million revenue increase resulted in a $6.8 million year-over-year increase in leasing gross profit. Reduced expenses in this area include lower maintenance costs of $2.0 million and reductions in personnel costs. For delivery and installation, gross profit decreased $1.5 million as the effect of reduced revenue was largely mitigated by proactive cost management resulting in a $3.0 million reduction in outside hauling expense
combined with reduced salaries for drivers and lower fuel costs. Sales gross profit increased $1.3 million on larger sales volume.
Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $14.9 million, or 8.8%, to $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $169.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the margin expanded to 44.1% from 40.8%. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by a reduction in SG&A expense and the higher gross profit discussed above. Excluding integration and stock-based compensation, SG&A expense decreased due to reduced costs for personnel of approximately $8.0 million and $2.3 million due to curtailed travel, partially offset by increased occupancy and other costs.
Capex for Rental Equipment: Purchases of rental equipment and refurbishments of $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $18.9 million lower than for the year ended December 31, 2019. Rental fleet expenditures were reduced significantly during the year ended December 31, 2020 in response to COVID-19, especially after the first quarter of 2020, and were primarily to meet demand for specific products, largely ground level offices.

Revenue: Total revenue increased $1.1 million, or 1.3%, to $83.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Currency fluctuations were immaterial for the current period. Leasing revenues increased 4.0% and delivery and installation revenues decreased 9.8%. Within leasing activity, average monthly rental rates for modular space units and portable storage units increased 5.5% and 5.7% year-over-year, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a 0.6% decline in modular space average units on rent and a 2.6% decrease in average portable storage units on rent. The decrease in delivery and installation revenues is due to an overall decrease in newly placed and returned units primarily resulting from a slower economy during the current-year period as a result of COVID-19. Sales revenues increased $0.6 million compared to the prior year.
Gross Profit: Gross profit increased $5.1 million, or 11.4%, to $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Proactive cost management fully mitigated the lower delivery and installation revenues and included reduced delivery and installation cost of $2.3 million. Gross profit on leasing increased 6.9% year-over-year. Gross profit on sales increased $1.3 million. Depreciation on rental equipment also decreased by $0.2 million.
Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.3 million, or 20.5%, to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the margin expanded to 37.1% from 31.2%. The increase resulted primarily from the favorable gross profit discussed above and decreased SG&A expense related largely to lower travel costs.
Capex for Rental Equipment: Purchases of rental equipment and refurbishments of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.6 million lower than for the year ended December 31, 2019. Rental fleet expenditures were reduced in 2020 in response to COVID-19.

Revenue: Total revenue decreased $23.0 million, or 18.9%, to $98.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Industrial softening, which began in the second half of 2019, was exacerbated in 2020 by an oversupply of oil leading to lower oil prices. Further, the effects of COVID-19 have resulted in decreased demand for oil. The business environment during 2020 resulted in reduced demand for our products as utilization based on OEC reduced from 71.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 62.6% for year ended December 31, 2020 and experienced a decrease in average rental rates compared to the prior-year period. However, utilization levels stabilized sequentially during the third quarter of 2020 and increased 700 bps to 65.2% in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Year-over-year leasing revenue decreased $15.2 million, or 18.7%, while delivery and installation revenue decreased $6.8 million, or 19.3%. Sales revenues decreased $1.0 million compared to the prior-year period.
Gross Profit: Gross profit decreased $13.4 million, or 21.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $48.9 million from $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit for leasing activity decreased $12.2 million driven by the decreased revenue as discussed above offset by reduced costs of $3.1 million, including decreased repairs and maintenance of $1.2 million and lower re-rent expense due to the lower activity. Gross profit for delivery and installation activity decreased $2.1 million reflecting the lower revenues offset by a $4.7 million decrease in expense, including $1.9 million less expense for outside hauling and a reduction in employee costs for delivery drivers. Depreciation of rental equipment decreased $1.4 million.
Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA decreased $11.4 million, or 24.1%, to $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the margin contracted to 36.4% from 38.9%. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the lower gross profit discussed above, offset by a $3.4 million reduction SG&A expense including $2.0 million in decreased employee costs.
Capex for rental equipment: Purchases of rental equipment and refurbishments were reduced significantly during 2020 due to the unfavorable environment for this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, expenditures of $7.8 million were $12.5 million lower than for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
WillScot Mobile Mini is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities from our subsidiaries, borrowings under the 2020 ABL Facility, and sales of equity and debt securities. We believe that our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our operating, debt service and capital requirements over the next twelve months.
We have been consistently engaged in the debt and equity capital markets both opportunistically and as necessary to support the growth of our business, desired leverage levels, and other capital allocation priorities. Subsequent to the Merger, we believe we have ample liquidity in the 2020 ABL Facility to support both organic operations and other capital allocation priorities as they arise.
We continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that any such acquisition may require us to incur additional debt to finance the acquisition and/or to issue shares of our Common Stock or other equity securities as acquisition consideration or as part of an overall financing plan. In addition, we will continue to evaluate options to improve our liquidity, such as the issuance of additional unsecured and secured debt, equity securities and/or equity-linked securities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all. From time to time, we may also seek to streamline our capital structure and improve our financial position through refinancing or restructuring our existing debt or retiring certain of our securities for cash or other consideration.
In anticipation of the Merger, on June 15, 2020, we completed a private offering of $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Secured Notes. The proceeds from the 2025 Secured Notes of $650.0 million were used to consummate the Merger and the related financing transactions, which included repayment of the 2022 Secured Notes, repayment of the Mobile Mini senior notes, and payment of certain fees and expenses related to the Merger and the related financing transactions. The 2025 Secured Notes mature on June 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2020.
On July 1, 2020, in connection with the completion of the Merger, Holdings, WSII, and certain of its subsidiaries, entered into the 2020 ABL Facility, which provides for revolving credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of up to $2.4 billion, consisting of: (i) a senior secured asset-based US dollar revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion (the “US Facility”), available to WSII and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “US Borrowers”), and (ii) a $400 million senior secured asset-based multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "Multicurrency Facility") together with the US Facility (collectively, the “2020 ABL Facility”), available to be drawn in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, British Pounds Sterling or Euros by the US Borrowers, and certain of WSII’s wholly-owned subsidiaries organized in Canada and in the UK. Borrowing availability under the 2020 ABL Facility is equal to the lesser of $2.4 billion and the applicable borrowing bases. The borrowing bases are a function of, among other things, the value of the assets in the relevant collateral pool of which our rental equipment represents the largest component. On July 1, 2020, in connection with the completion of the Merger, approximately $1.47 billion of proceeds from the 2020 ABL Facility were used to repay the 2017 ABL Facility, repay Mobile Mini's asset-backed lending facility, and pay fees and expenses related to the Merger and the related financing transactions. On August 11, 2020, we redeemed $49.0 million of our 2023 Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103.0% plus accrued and unpaid interest using proceeds from the 2020 ABL Facility. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion of available borrowing capacity under the 2020 ABL Facility.
On August 25, 2020, we completed a private offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Secured Notes. Proceeds from the 2028 Secured notes were used to repay the $441.0 million remaining outstanding principal of the 2023 Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103.438% plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2028 Secured Notes mature on August 15, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 4.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually on August 15 and February 15 of each year, beginning February 25, 2021.
COVID-19 Impact on Liquidity
Although there is uncertainty related to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future results, we believe our predictable lease revenue streams underpinned by long lease durations, combined with steps we have taken to reduce cost and capital spending, increased our internally generated free cash flow in 2020, and we expect our free cash flow generation to continue to increase. Further, the approximately $1.1 billion of availability under our 2020 ABL Facility as of December 31, 2020, provides additional liquidity in excess of our free cash flow generation. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, actively managing our cost structure, reducing or delaying capital spending and developing new
opportunities for growth. We believe that the actions we have taken in recent years to increase our scale and competitive position and strengthen our balance sheet have positioned us well to manage through periods of economic disruption.
Cash Flows
Significant factors driving our liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities and capex. Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets.
The following summarizes our change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented:
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and December 31, 2019 and 2018
Cash Flows from operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $304.8 million as compared to $172.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $132.2 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase of $83.4 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items, primarily due to the impact of the Merger on revenues and gross profit. This was partially offset by a decrease of $4.4 million in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities which was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $20.9 million, an increase in prepaid and other assets of $12.7 million, and a decrease in accrued interest of $7.7 million, compared to the same period in 2019. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash used from accounts receivable of $36.9 million compared to the same period in 2019.
Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $172.6 million as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $135.5 million. This increase was primarily due to a $159.1 million increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, in 2019 as compared to 2018, as a result of the impact of the ModSpace acquisition on operations, which is reflected in our results for all of 2019, but is only included for four and a half months in 2018. This increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, was partially offset by a decrease of $23.7 million in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was attributable to an increase in trade receivables and an increase in cash interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Cash flows from investing activities
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $125.4 million as compared to $152.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $27.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a $32.7 million decrease in cash used for purchase of rental equipment and refurbishments. Cash used for purchase of rental equipment and refurbishments decreased compared to 2019 as fleet was less constrained due to reduced utilization and reduced demand for new project deliveries as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current period impact of prior year spend. Additionally, $17.2 million of cash was acquired as part of the Merger. This increase was partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment, an increase of $8.2 million on purchases of property, plant and equipment and a $3.2 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment. Proceeds from sale of rental equipment decreased compared to the prior year due to lower sales demand.
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $152.6 million as compared to $1,217.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,064.6 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a $1,083.1 million decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, an $11.3 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and an $18.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The decrease in cash used in business acquisitions was due to the acquisition of ModSpace during the year ended December 31, 2018, with no business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019. Proceeds from the sale of rental equipment increased due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of ModSpace. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment increased primarily as a result of the sale of non-operating branch locations during the year ended December 31, 2019, as part of the ongoing integration and consolidation process following the acquisition of ModSpace. The overall decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by an increase in capex of $44.2 million in 2019, which was primarily driven by increased refurbishments of existing fleet, following our recent acquisitions, and purchases of VAPS to drive revenue growth.
Cash flows from financing activities
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $159.0 million as compared to $26.1 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $132.9 million cash used.
The increase in cash used in financing activities was driven by an increase of $62.9 million for payment of financing costs, an increase of $27.4 million for payment of debt extinguishment costs, payment of $21.8 million for the repurchase and cancellation of warrants, payment of $4.2 million for Common Stock issuance costs, an increase of $12.8 million of taxes paid on employee stock awards, and an increase of $8.4 million of principal payments on finance lease obligations. Additionally, there was a net increase of $5.1 million of payments on borrowings, comprised of an increase in repayments of borrowings of $2,239.7 million that was partially offset by an increase receipts from borrowings of $2,234.6 million. The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by an increase in receipts from the issuance of Common Stock from the exercise of options and warrants of $9.7 million.
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $26.1 million as compared to $1,180.0 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1,206.1 million cash used. The increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in borrowings, net of repayments of $1,086.0 million, a decrease in receipts from the issuance of Common Stock of $146.3 million primarily related to the financing of the ModSpace acquisition and an increase in debt extinguishment costs of $7.1 million. In connection with the ModSpace acquisition, in 2018 we borrowed an aggregate of $1,097.1 million related to the issuance of the 2023 Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes, and through the up-sized 2017 ABL Facility. The 2018 stock issuance was used to finance the acquisition of ModSpace. We paid redemption premium costs of $7.1 million in 2019 as a result of the redemption of the Unsecured Notes and the $30.0 million prepayment on the 2022 Secured Notes. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in financing fees payments of $34.0 million due to the significant fees incurred in 2018 as part of the financing activities noted above in connected with the acquisition of ModSpace.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents information relating to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020:
(a) Long-term indebtedness includes borrowings and interest under the 2020 ABL Facility, the 2025 Secured Notes, the 2028 Secured Notes, and finance leases.
(b) Includes the obligations under our interest rate swap agreement that effectively convert $400 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the Company’s 2020 ABL Facility into fixed-rate debt. The future obligations under the interest rate swaps were calculated using the 1-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2020.
(c) Amounts relate to the delay in payment of employer payroll taxes in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the ‘‘CARES Act’’).
At December 31, 2020, in addition to the above contractual obligations, we had $14.5 million of potential long-term tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these potential long-term tax liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capex or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances and reevaluate our estimates and judgments as appropriate. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity in the preparation of financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
Leasing and Services Revenue
The majority of revenue is generated by rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 840, Leases ("ASC 840") in 2018 and ASC 842 in 2019 and 2020. The remaining revenue is generated by performance obligations in contracts with customers for services or sale of units subject to the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue ("ASC 605"), in 2018 and ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASC 606") in 2019 and 2020.
Leasing Revenue
Income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company's lease arrangements can include multiple lease and non-lease components. Examples of lease components include, but are not limited to, the lease of modular space, portable storage units and VAPS. Examples of non-lease components include, but are not limited to, the delivery, installation, maintenance, and removal services commonly provided in a bundled transaction with the lease components. Arrangement consideration is allocated between lease deliverables and non-lease components based on the relative estimated selling (leasing) price of each deliverable. Estimated selling (leasing) price of the lease deliverables is based upon the estimated stand-alone selling price of the related performance obligations using an adjusted market approach.
When leases and services are billed in advance, recognition of revenue is deferred until services are rendered. If equipment is returned prior to the contractually obligated period, the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date is recognized as incremental revenue upon return.
Rental equipment is leased primarily under operating leases and, from time to time, under sales-type lease arrangements. Operating lease minimum contractual terms within the NA Modular segment generally range from 1 month to 60 months and averaged approximately 9 months across this segment's rental fleet for the year ended December 31, 2020.Rental contracts with customers within the NA Storage and UK Storage segments are generally based on a 28-day rate and billing cycle. The rental continues until cancelled by the Company or the customer. There were no material sales-type lease arrangements as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.
The Company may use third parties to satisfy its performance obligations, including both the provision of rental units and other services. To determine whether it is the principal or agent in the arrangement, the Company reviews each third-party relationship on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company is considered an agent when its role is to arrange for another entity to provide the rental units and other services to the customer. In these instances, the Company does not control the rental unit or service before it is provided. The Company is considered the principal when it controls the rental unit or service prior to transferring control to the customer. WillScot Mobile Mini may be a principal in the fulfillment of some rental units and services and an agent for other rental units and services within the same contract. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis when the Company is the principal in the arrangement and on a net basis when it is the agent.
The adoption of ASC 842 at January 1, 2019, did not have a significant impact on the recognition of leasing revenue. Based on the requirements of ASC 842, the Company records changes in estimated collectability, directly against leasing revenue.
Services Revenue
The Company generally has three non-lease service-related performance obligations in its contracts with customers:
•Delivery and installation of the modular or portable storage unit;
•Maintenance and other ad hoc services performed during the lease term; and
•Removal services that occur at the end of the lease term.
Consideration is allocated to each of these performance obligations within the contract based upon their estimated relative standalone selling prices using the estimated cost plus a margin approach. Revenue from these activities is recognized as the services are performed.
Sales Revenue
Sales revenue is generated by the sale of new and rental units. Revenue from the sale of new and rental units is generally recognized at a point in time upon the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs when the unit is delivered and installed in accordance with the contract. Sales transactions constitute a single performance obligation.
Other Matters
The Company's non-lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration, other than the variability noted for services arrangements expected to be performed beyond a twelve-month period.
The Company's payment terms vary by the type and location of its customer and the product or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. While the Company may bill certain customers in advance, its contracts do not contain a significant financing component based on the short length of time between upfront billings and
the performance of contracted services. For certain products, services, or customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
Revenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment
For acquired businesses, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Generally, reporting units are at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment (the component level), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to each of the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the combination.
The Company performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1 at the reporting unit level, as well as during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances occur that, in management’s judgment, may constitute triggering events under ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The Company performs its assessment of goodwill utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. The qualitative impairment test assesses company-specific, industry, market and general economic factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or elects not to use the qualitative impairment test, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. The Company uses an independent valuation specialist for its annual impairment tests to assist in the valuation.
The Company has historically used the quantitative impairment test to evaluate goodwill for impairment. The Company used the qualitative approach for the reporting units acquired in the Merger due to the proximity of the July 1, 2020 acquisition date to the October 1, 2020 measurement date.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, value of net operating losses, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Management bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates.
If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of the Williams Scotsman trade name and the Mobile Mini trade name. The Company performs its assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. When utilizing a quantitative impairment test, the Company calculates fair value using a relief-from-royalty method. This method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent the recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value.
Other intangible assets that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. Amortization is recognized in profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset.
Purchase Accounting
The Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional and could change as additional information is received. When appropriate, our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. Valuations are finalized as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
Long-lived assets (principally rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions. Rental equipment is valued utilizing a replacement cost approach. Intangible assets are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and generally consist of customer relationships and trade names. Determination of the estimated fair value of intangible assets requires judgment. The estimated fair value of customer relationships is determined based on estimates and judgments regarding discounted future after-tax earnings and cash flows arising from lease renewals and new lease arrangements expected from customer relationships. The fair value of trade name intangible assets is determined utilizing the relief from royalty method. Under this form of the income approach, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade name and discounted to present value.
Rental Equipment
Rental equipment is comprised of modular space and portable storage units held for rent or on rent to customers, tank and pump solutions products, which consist primarily of liquid and solid containment units, pumps and filtration equipment, and VAPS which are in use or available to be used by customers. Rental equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Costs of improvements and betterments to rental equipment are capitalized when such costs extend the useful life of the equipment or increase the rental value of the unit. Costs incurred for equipment to meet a particular customer specification are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term taking in consideration the residual value of the asset. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, as follows:
Trade Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company is exposed to credit losses from trade receivables generated through its leasing and sales business. The Company assesses each customer’s ability to pay for the products it leases or sells by conducting a credit review. The credit review considers expected billing exposure and timing for payment and the customer’s established credit rating. The Company performs its credit review of new customers at inception of the customer relationship and for existing customers when the customer transacts new leases after a defined period of dormancy. The Company also considers contract terms and conditions, country risk and business strategy in the evaluation.
The Company monitors ongoing credit exposure through an active review of customer balances against contract terms and due dates. The Company may employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. The allowances for credit losses reflect the estimate of the amount of receivables that the Company will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. This estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, the Company may be required to increase or decrease our allowances.
In accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-2, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASC 842"), effective January 1, 2019, and the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASC 326"), effective January 1, 2020, specifically identifiable lease revenue receivables and sales receivables not deemed probable of collection are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The remaining provision for credit losses is recorded as selling, general and administrative expense. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the entire provision for credit losses was recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. The Company reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis.
Stock-Based Compensation
Prior to the Merger, stock awards were granted under the WillScot Corporation 2017 Incentive Award Plan (the "2017 Incentive Plan"), which included Restricted Stock Awards ("RSAs") and Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). On June 24, 2020, WillScot's stockholders approved the WillScot Mobile Mini 2020 Incentive Award Plan ("2020 Incentive Plan") to take effect pending completion of the Merger. The plan amended and restated in its entirety the 2017 Incentive Plan. As a result, all historical and future incentive awards to the Company's Board of Directors, executive officers and employees, as determined by the Company's Compensation Committee ("the Comp Committee"), are granted under the 2020 Incentive Plan. The 2020 Incentive Plan is administered by the Comp Committee. Under the 2020 Incentive Plan, the Comp Committee may grant an aggregate of 6,488,988 shares of Common Stock in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSUs, performance compensation awards and stock bonus awards. Stock-based payments, including the grant of stock options, RSAs and RSUs, are subject to service-based vesting requirements, and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
Stock-based compensation expense includes grants of stock options, time-based RSUs ("Time-Based RSUs") and performance-based RSUs ("Performance-Based RSUs", together with Time-Based RSUs, the "RSUs"). The 2020 Incentive Plan continues the former Market-Based RSUs renamed as "Performance-Based RSUs." RSUs are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. In addition, stock-based payments to non-executive directors include grants of RSAs. Time-Based RSUs and RSAs are valued based on the intrinsic value of the difference between the exercise price, if any, of the award and the fair market value of WillScot Mobile Mini's Common Stock on the grant date. Performance-Based RSUs are valued based on a Monte Carlo simulation model to reflect the impact of the Performance-Based RSUs market condition. The probability of satisfying a market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant-date fair value for Performance-Based
RSUs and the compensation cost is not reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service has been provided.
RSAs cliff vest in a one year period. Time-Based RSUs vest ratably over a period of four years. Performance-Based RSUs cliff vest based on achievement of the relative total stockholder return ("TSR") of the Company's Common Stock as compared to the TSR of the constituents of the Russell 3000 Index at the grant date over the performance period of three years. The target number of RSUs may be adjusted from 0% to 150% based on the TSR attainment levels defined by the Comp Committee. The 100% target payout is tied to performance at the 50% percentile, with a payout curve ranging from 0% (for performance less than the 25% percentile) to 150% (for performance at or above the 75% percentile). Vesting is also subject to continued service requirements through the vesting date.
Stock options vest in tranches over a period of four years and expire ten years from the grant date. The fair value of each stock option award on the grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, weighted-average risk-free interest rate and weighted-average expected term of the options. The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was based on a blend of peer group volatility and Company trading history as the Company did not have a sufficient trading history as a stand-alone public company. Future calculations will use the Company trading history. Additionally, due to an insufficient history with respect to stock option activity and post-vesting cancellations, the expected term assumption is based on the simplified method under GAAP, which is based on the vesting period and contractual term for each tranche of awards. The mid-point between the weighted-average vesting term and the expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied US Treasury bill yield curve at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company’s expected term assumption. WillScot Mobile Mini has never declared or paid a cash dividend on common shares.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The Company assesses the likelihood that each of the deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent management believes realization of any deferred tax assets is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. When a valuation allowance is established or there is an increase in an allowance in a reporting period, tax expense is generally recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces the Company’s income tax expense.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for the income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are indefinitely reinvested, or will only be repatriated when possible to do so at minimal additional tax cost. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit (loss) for the year.
In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company classifies interest on tax deficiencies and income tax penalties within income tax expense.
