Recent Developments Related to COVID-19
Overview. Our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the recent and ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the President of the United States. Efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have included shelter-in-place orders, the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings, among other things, throughout many parts of the United States and, in particular, the markets in which we operate. As the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, there are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 including, among other things, its severity; the duration of the outbreak; the impact to our customers, employees and vendors; the impact to the financial services and banking industry; and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact (both economic and health-related). COVID-19 has negatively affected, and is expected to continue to negatively affect, our business, financial position and operating results. In light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein, the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time, but it has been and is expected to continue to be material.
Impact on our Operations. In the State of Texas, many jurisdictions declared health emergencies. The resulting closures and/or limited operations of non-essential businesses and related economic disruption have impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers. Financial services have been identified as a Critical Infrastructure Sector by the Department of Homeland Security. Accordingly, our business remains open. To address the issues arising as a result of COVID-19, and in order to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees, we have implemented our Business Continuity and Health Emergency Response plans. Among other things, significant actions taken under these plans include:
•Implemented our communications plans to ensure our employees, customers and critical vendors are kept abreast of developments affecting our operations.
•Restricted all non-essential travel and large external gatherings and have instituted a mandatory quarantine period for anyone that has traveled to an impacted area.
•After temporarily closing all of our financial center lobbies and other corporate facilities to non-employees, except for certain limited cases by appointment only, we have reopened our financial center lobbies.
•Expanded remote-access availability so that nearly all of our workforce has the capability to work from home or other remote locations. All activities are performed in accordance with our compliance and information security policies designed to ensure customer data and other information is properly safeguarded.
•Instituted mandatory social distancing policies for those employees not working remotely. Members of certain operations teams have been split into separate buildings or locations to create redundancy for key functions across the organization.
Notwithstanding the foregoing actions, the COVID-19 outbreak could still, among other things, greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism, particularly among key personnel; further limit access to or result in further closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices; exacerbate operational, technical or security-related risks arising from a remote workforce; and result in adverse government or regulatory agency orders. The business and operations of our third-party service providers, many of whom perform critical services for our business, could also be significantly impacted, which in turn could impact us. As a result, we are currently unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown and/or beyond our control.
Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations. Our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations, the availability of our workforce, the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us. While its effects continue to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the State of Texas as well as nationally. This decrease in commercial activity has caused and may continue to cause our customers (including affected businesses and individuals), vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. The national public health crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (and public expectations about it), combined with certain pre-existing factors, including, but not limited to, international trade disputes, inflation risks and oil price volatility, could further destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements has impacted the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers. Borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions (such as the unemployment rate), which, in turn, are likely to impact our borrowers' creditworthiness and our ability to make loans. See further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned “Loans” and “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion.
In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits, affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer. Consumers affected by COVID-19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over. For example, consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or long-term basis and certain industries may take longer to recover (particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings) as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction. We lend to customers operating in such industries including energy, retail/strip centers, hotels/lodging, restaurants, entertainment and commercial real estate, among others, that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely. To help mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19, loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments, or portions thereof, for up to 90 days. After 90 days, customers may apply for an additional deferral. Additionally, the temporary closures of bank branches and the safety precautions implemented at re-opened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing face-to-face interaction. Our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors. The potential changes in behaviors driven by COVID-19 also present heightened liquidity risks, for example, arising from increased demand for our products and services (such as unusually high draws on credit facilities) or decreased demand for our products and services (such as idiosyncratic, or broad-based, market or other developments that lead to deposit outflows).
Legislative and Regulatory Developments. Recent actions taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 will also have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. These actions are further discussed below.
In an emergency measure aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19, the Federal Reserve lowered the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to 0.25% effective on March 16, 2020. This action by the Federal Reserve followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rates to a range of 1.0% to 1.25% effective on March 4, 2020. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. As our balance sheet is more asset sensitive, our earnings are more adversely affected by decreases in market interest rates as the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly and to a larger degree than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. The decline in interest rates has already led to new all-time low yields across the US Treasury maturity curve. In September 2020, the Federal Reserve indicated that it expects to maintain the targeted
federal funds rate at current levels until such time that labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. This timeframe is currently expected to last through 2023. Nonetheless, if the Federal Reserve decreases the targeted federal funds rates even further in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, overall interest rates will decline further, which will negatively impact our net interest income and further compress our net interest margin.
Other actions taken by the Federal Reserve in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 include:
•Expanded reverse repo operations, adding liquidity to the banking system.
•Restarted quantitative easing.
•Lowered the interest rate on the discount window by 1.5% to 0.25%.
•Reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent.
•Encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend.
•Introduced and expanded several new programs that will operate on a temporary basis to help preserve market liquidity.
The U.S. government has also enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19. The Phase 1 legislation, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, was enacted on March 6, 2020 and, among other things, authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures. The Phase 2 legislation, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020 and provides for paid sick/medical leave, establishes no-cost coverage for coronavirus testing, expands unemployment benefits, expands food assistance, and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic, among other provisions. The Phase 3 legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), was enacted on March 27, 2020. Among other provisions, the CARES Act (i) authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to make loans, loan guarantees and other investments, up to $500 billion, for assistance to eligible businesses, States and municipalities with limited, targeted relief for passenger air carriers, cargo air carriers, and businesses critical to maintaining national security, (ii) created a $349 billion loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) for loans to small businesses for, among other things, payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments, (iii) provided certain credits against the 2020 personal income tax for eligible individuals and their dependents, (iv) expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance and provides eligible recipients with an additional $600 per week on top of the unemployment amount determined by each State and (v) expanded tele-health services in Medicare. The Phase 3.5 legislation, the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act of 2020 (the “PPPHE Act”), was enacted on April 24, 2020. Among other things, the PPPHE Act provided an additional $310 billion of funding for the PPP of which, $30 billion is specifically allocated for use by banks and other insured depository institutions that have assets between $10 billion and $50 billion.
The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020” (the “PPPF Act”) was enacted in June 2020 and modified the PPP as follows: (i) established a minimum maturity of five years for all loans made after the enactment of the PPPF Act and permits an extension of the maturity of existing loans to five years if the borrower and lender agree; (ii) extended the “covered period” of the CARES Act from June 30, 2020, to December 31, 2020; (iii) extended the eight-week “covered period” for expenditures that qualify for forgiveness to the earlier of 24 weeks following loan origination or December 31, 2020; (iv) extended the deferral period for payment of principal, interest and fees to the date on which the forgiveness amount is remitted to the lender by the SBA; (v) changed requirements such that the borrower must use at least 60% (down from 75%) of the proceeds of the loan for payroll costs, and up to 40% (up from 25%), for other permitted purposes, as a condition to obtaining forgiveness of the loan; (vi) delayed from June 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020 the date by which employees must be rehired to avoid a reduction in the amount of forgiveness of a loan, and creates a “rehiring safe harbor” that allows businesses to remain eligible for loan forgiveness if they make a good-faith attempt to rehire employees or hire similarly qualified employees, but are unable to do so, or are able to document an inability to return to pre-COVID-19 levels of business activity due to compliance with social distancing measures; and (vii) allows borrowers to receive both loan forgiveness under the PPP and the payroll tax deferral permitted under the CARES Act, rather than having to choose which of the two would be more advantageous.
In July 2020, the CARES Act was amended to extend, through August 8, 2020, the SBA’s authority to make commitments under the PPP. The SBA’s existing authority had previously expired on June 30, 2020. In August 2020, President Trump signed four executive actions to provide additional COVID-19 relief. The first action authorized the Lost Wages Assistance Program (“LWAP”), which provides for a $400-per-week payment to those currently receiving more than $100 a week in unemployment benefits due to disruptions caused by COVID-19. The LWAP per-week payment is retroactive to the week ending August 1, 2020. The second executive action extended the moratorium on payments and interest accrual on student loans held by the government until the end of 2020. The moratorium was previously set to expire September 30, 2020. The third action instructed the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help provide temporary assistance to renters and homeowners and promote their ability to avoid eviction or foreclosure. The fourth executive action allows employers to defer, for the period from September 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the employee portion of Social Security payroll taxes for certain individuals earning less than approximately $104 thousand per year.
In December 2020, the Bipartisan-Bicameral Omnibus COVID Relief Deal, included as a component of appropriations legislation, was enacted to provide economic stimulus to individuals and businesses in further response to the economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the legislation includes (i) payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year, (ii) extension of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program to include a $300 weekly enhancement in unemployment benefits beginning after December 26, 2020 up to March 14, 2021, (iii) a temporary and targeted rental assistance program, and extends the eviction moratorium through January 31, 2021, (iv) targeted funding related to transportation, education, agriculture, nutrition and other public health measures and (v) approximately $325 billion for small business relief, including approximately $284 billion for a second round of PPP loans and a new simplified forgiveness procedure for PPP loans of $150,000 or less. We are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the U.S. government.
The Federal Reserve created various additional lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to help provide financing in response to the financial disruptions caused by COVID-19. The programs include, among others, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (the “PPP Facility”), which is intended to extend loans to banks making PPP loans. The Federal Reserve announced extensions through March 31, 2021 for several of its lending facilities, including the PPP Facility, that were generally scheduled to expire on or around December 31, 2020. As more fully discussed in the section captioned “Loans” elsewhere in this discussion, we are currently participating in the PPP as a lender. We have not participated in the PPP Facility.
Banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. This disruption has impacted our cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets if we need or desire to do so and, although the ultimate impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time in light of the uncertainties and ongoing developments noted herein, such impacts could be material. Furthermore, bank regulatory agencies have been (and are expected to continue to be) very proactive in responding to both market and supervisory concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the potential impact on customers, especially borrowers. As shown during and following the financial crisis of 2007-2008, periods of economic and financial disruption and stress have, in the past, resulted in increased scrutiny of banking organizations. We are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards. Such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates
We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.
We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the
accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements.
Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326 (“ASC 326”) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. See the section captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion as well as Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for credit losses.
Overview
The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020 (the “2019 Form 10-K”) for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2019.
Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. From time to time, we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary. None of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements. We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and as such, the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition.
Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields. Taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a 21% income tax rate.
Dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts.
Results of Operations
Net income available to common shareholders totaled $323.6 million, or $5.10 diluted per common share, in 2020 compared to $435.5 million, or $6.84 diluted per common share, in 2019 and $446.9 million, or $6.90 diluted per common share, in 2018.
Selected income statement data, returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows:
Net income available to common shareholders decreased $111.9 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a $207.5 million increase in credit loss expense, a $28.0 million decrease in net interest income and a $14.2 million increase in non-interest expense partly offset by a $101.6 million increase in non-interest income and a $35.7 million decrease in income tax expense. The increase in credit loss expense during 2020 resulted from both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio, including those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices. The increase in non-interest income during 2020 was primarily related to a $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions. Net income available to common shareholders for 2020 was also impacted by the reclassification of $5.5 million of issuance costs associated with our Series A Preferred Stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter.
Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 67.7% of total revenue during 2020. Excluding the revenue associated with the $109.0 million net gain on securities transactions realized during 2020, net interest income would have represented 73.2% of total revenue during 2020. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin.
The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began 2018 at 4.50% and increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the year at 5.50%. During 2019, the prime rate decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 4.75%. During 2020, the prime rate decreased 150 basis points in March to 3.25% where it remained through
December 31, 2020. Our loan portfolio is also significantly impacted, by changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2020, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 0.14% and 0.24%, respectively, while at December 31, 2019, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 1.76% and 1.90% respectively, and at December 31, 2018, the one-month and three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates were 2.50% and 2.81% respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began 2018 at 1.25% to 1.50% and increased 100 basis points (25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December) to end the year at 2.25% to 2.50%. During 2019, the target range for the federal funds rate decreased 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 (25 basis points in each of August and September) and 25 basis points in October 2019 to end the year at 1.50% to 1.75%. During 2020, the target range for the federal funds rate decreased 150 basis points in March to zero to 0.25% where it remained through December 31, 2020. As noted in the section captioned “Recent Developments Related to COVID-19” elsewhere in this discussion, the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2020 was largely an emergency measure by the Federal Reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of COVID-19.
We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. Though federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in 2011, we have not experienced any significant additional interest costs as a result. See
