Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion provides our highlights and commentary related to factors impacting our financial conditions and further describes the results of operations. The most significant risks and uncertainties are discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Management's Discussion and Analysis - Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019
The comparison of fiscal 2020 with fiscal 2019, including the results of operations and liquidity, can be found in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section of our 2020 Form 10-K, which comparison is incorporated by reference herein.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Our mission is to be the world leader at informing and entertaining audiences through dynamic audio-visual communication systems. We organize into business units to focus on customer loyalty over time and earn new and replacement business as our products have a finite lifetime. See "Note 3. Segment Reporting" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for further information. Our strategies include the creation of a comprehensive line of innovative solutions and systems and our ability to create and leverage platform designs and technologies. These strategies align us to effectively deliver value to our varied customers and their market needs, while serving our stakeholders over the long-term. We focus on creating local capabilities for sales, service, and manufacturing in geographies with expected digital market opportunities. We believe consistently generating profitable growth will provide value to our stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, and communities).
We measure our success using a variety of measures including:
•
our percentage of market share by comparing our estimated revenue to the total estimated global digital display revenue;
•
our order growth compared to the overall digital market order change;
•
financial metrics such as annual order volume and profit change as compared to our previous financial results;
•
customer retention and expansion rates; and
•
our ability to generate profits over the long-term to provide a shareholder return.
Certain factors impact our ability to succeed in these strategies and impact our business units to varying degrees. For example, the overall manufacturing cost and the selling prices of our products have decreased over the years and are expected to continue to decrease in the future. Our competitors outside the U.S. are impacted differently by the global trade environment allowing them to avoid tariff costs or reduce prices. As a result, additional competitors have entered the market, and each year we must sell more product to generate the same or greater level of net sales as in previous fiscal years. However, the decline of digital solution pricing over the years and increased user adoption and applications have increased the size of the global market.
Competitor offerings, actions and reactions also can vary and change over time or in certain customer situations. Projects with multimillion-dollar revenue potential attracts competition, and competitors can use marketing or other tactics to win business.
Each business unit's long-term performance can be impacted by economic conditions in different ways and to different degrees. The effects of an adverse economy are generally less severe on our sports related business as compared to our other businesses, although in severe economic downturns with social changes causing decreases in sporting event revenues, the sports business can also be seriously impacted.
Outlook: The COVID-19 pandemic has created global disruptions since its initial outbreak and our reaction to it continue to evolve. The future extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Developments include the ultimate severity, spread, and containment of the disease, the duration of the pandemic or any strain reemergence, the global availability and effectiveness of vaccines, global travel restrictions and social distancing requirements, the pace and extent of the economic recovery, and any change in trends and practices in how people gather. Our customer reduced their spend on audiovisual systems and related services in fiscal 2021 as they worked through the economic and business implications of COVID-19. As economies and restrictions ease, we believe our markets will recover and we will be poised to grow over the long-term.
During fiscal 2021, we lowered overall staffing and benefit levels and temporarily furloughed employees to achieve lower operating costs to align with the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions vary in permanency and some will not be sustainable through fiscal 2022 as our order and sales volumes begin to recover towards pre-pandemic levels.
Late in our fiscal 2021, supply chain disruptions began to emerge as a result of the pandemic, shipping container shortages, winter weather, and the changes in global demand. Specifically, we are impacted by the global shortage of semiconductors and related electronic components, other materials needed for production, and freight availability. We expect headwinds in material, labor, freight availability and inflation as the world economies recover, which may cause volatility in our revenue cycles and production costs. While we cannot predict the length or severity of these conditions, it is reasonably possible they will have some impact on our operations during fiscal 2022.
During late fiscal 2021, order and quoting activities have increased creating a strong backlog and positive outlook; however, there is no assurance that this trend will continue in future quarters.
In addition to the COVID-19 and supply chain impacts described above, the outlook and unique key growth drivers and challenges by our business units include:
Commercial Business Unit: Our customers who rely on advertising revenues for Out-of-Home ("OOH") advertising or who are reliant on customer foot-traffic to drive sales are beginning to increase their capital spending through the COVID-19 economic recovery. Businesses using our displays for self-promotion or on-premise advertising may have reduced budgets for the foreseeable future or choose to utilize displays as part of their recovery, both actions creating an impact to the Commercial near-term outlook.
Over the long-term, we believe growth in the Commercial business unit will result from a number of factors, including:
•
Standard display product market growth due to market adoption and lower product costs, which drive marketplace expansion. Standard display products are used to attract or communicate with customers and potential customers of retail, commercial, and other establishments. Pricing and economic conditions are the principal factors that impact our success in this business unit. We utilize a reseller network to distribute our standard products.
•
National accounts standard display market opportunities due to customers' desire to communicate their message, advertising and content consistently across the country. Increased demand is possible from national retailers, quick-serve restaurants, petroleum retailers, and other nationwide organizations.
•
Additional standard display offerings using micro-LED designs.
•
Increasing use of LED technologies replacing signage previously using liquid crystal display ("LCD") technology by existing and new customers.
•
Increasing interest in spectaculars, which include very large and sometimes highly customized displays as part of entertainment venues such as casinos, shopping centers, cruise ships and Times Square type locations.
•
Dynamic messaging systems demand growth due to market adoption and expanded use of this technology.
•
The use of architectural lighting products for commercial buildings, which real estate owners use to add accents or effects to an entire side or circumference of a building to communicate messages or to decorate the building.
•
The continued deployment of digital billboards as OOH advertising companies continue developing new sites and replacing digital billboards reaching end of life. This is dependent on no adverse changes occurring in the digital billboard regulatory environment restricting future billboard deployments, as well as maintaining our current market share in a business that is concentrated in a few large OOH companies.
•
Replacement cycles within each of these areas.
Live Events Business Unit: Our customers have been adversely impacted by governmental limitations on the number of people allowed to gather in certain spaces as part of COVID-19 safety measures since March 2020 with varied or no published expiration. In the near-term, our customers who rely on advertising and event revenues are expected to delay spending on projects because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes to the ways and willingness of how people gather may change the demand for our systems. As the restrictions of gathering start to decrease, we believe more customers may choose to begin to invest in their locations.
Over the long-term, we believe growth in the Live Events business unit will result from a number of factors, including:
•
Facilities spending more on larger display systems to enhance the game-day and event experience for attendees.
•
Lower product costs, driving an expansion of the marketplace.
•
Our product and service offerings, including additional micro-LED offerings which remain the most integrated and comprehensive offerings in the industry.
•
The competitive nature of sports teams, which strive to out-perform their competitors with display systems.
•
The desire for high-definition video displays, which typically drive larger displays or higher resolution displays, both of which increase the average transaction size.
•
Dynamic messaging system needs throughout a sports facility.
•
Increasing use of LED technologies replacing signage previously using LCD technology in and surrounding live events facilities.
•
Replacement cycles within each of these areas.
High School Park and Recreation Business Unit: In the near-term, our customers who rely on advertising revenue for sports installations or who may be impacted by governmental tax revenue availability may choose to delay spending on projects because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Over the long-term, we believe growth in the High School Park and Recreation business unit will result from a number of factors, including:
•
Increased demand for video systems in high schools as school districts realize the revenue generating potential of these displays compared to traditional scoreboards and these systems' ability to provide or enhance academic curriculum offerings for students.
•
Increased demand for different types of displays and dynamic messaging systems, such as message centers at schools to communicate to students, parents and the broader community.
•
Lower system costs driving the use of more sophisticated displays in school athletic facilities, such as large integrated video systems.
•
Expanding control system options tailored for the markets' needs.
Transportation Business Unit: In the near term, customers in the mass-transit and airport part of the market are expected to delay spending as a result of the limited use of this infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the long-term, roadway projects may be impacted due to reduced tax revenues. That impact will increase as the duration of the reduction in infrastructure usage continues.
Over the long-term, we believe growth in the Transportation business unit will result from a number of factors, including:
•
Increasing applications and acceptance of electronic displays to manage transportation systems, including roadway, airport, parking, transit and other applications.
•
Effective use of the United States transportation infrastructure requires intelligent transportation systems. This growth is highly dependent on government spending, primarily by state and federal governments, along with the continuing acceptance of private/public partnerships as an alternative funding source.
•
Expanded use of dynamic messaging systems for advertising and wayfinding use in public transport and airport terminals due to expanded market usage and displays, with LED technology replacing prior LCD installations and additional display offerings using micro-LEDs.
International Business Unit: In the near-term, our customers who rely on advertising, retail, event revenues and governmental tax revenue availability are expected to delay spending on projects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes to the ways and willingness of how people gather may change the demand for our systems. As the restrictions of gathering start to decrease, we believe more customers may choose to begin to invest in their locations. Customers who rely on advertising revenues for OOH advertising or who are reliant on customer foot-traffic to drive sales are beginning to increase their capital spending.
Over the long-term, we believe growth in the International business unit will result from a number of factors, including:
•
Achieving greater penetration in various geographies and building products more suited to individual markets. We continue to broaden our product offerings into the transportation segment in Europe and the Middle East.
•
Continued focus on sports facility, spectacular-type, OOH advertising products, and architectural lighting market opportunities and the factors listed in each of the other business units to the extent they apply out of the United States and Canada.
•
Additional opportunities exist with expanded market usage of LED technology due to price considerations, usage of LED technology replacing prior LCD installations and additional display offerings using micro-LEDs.
• Our product and service offerings, including additional micro-LED offerings which remain the most integrated and comprehensive offerings in the industry.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting policies are described in "Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
A critical accounting policy is defined as a policy that is both very important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We regularly review our critical accounting policies and evaluate them based on these factors. We believe the estimation process for uniquely configured contracts and warranties are most material and critical. These areas contain estimates with a reasonable likelihood to change, and those changes could have a material impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. The estimation processes for these areas are also difficult, subjective and use complex judgments. Our critical accounting estimates are based on historical experience; on our interpretation of GAAP, current laws and regulations; and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revenue recognition on uniquely configured contracts. Revenue for uniquely configured (custom) or integrated systems is recognized over time using the cost incurred input method. Over time revenue recognition is appropriate because we have no alternative use for the uniquely configured system and have an enforceable right to payment for work performed. The cost incurred input method measures cost incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract. This method is the most faithful depiction of our performance because it measures the value of the contract transferred to the customer. Costs to perform the contract include direct and indirect costs for contract design, production, integration, installation, and assurance-type warranty reserve. Direct costs include material and components; manufacturing, project management and engineering labor; and subcontracting expenses. Indirect costs include allocated charges for such items as facilities and equipment depreciation and general overhead. Provisions of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period when such losses are capable of being estimated.
We may have multiple performance obligations in these types of contracts; however, a majority are treated as a combined single performance obligation. In our judgment, this accounting treatment is most appropriate because the substantial part of our promise to our customer is to provide significant integration services and incorporate individual goods and services into a combined output or system. Often times the system is customized or significantly modified to the customer's desired configurations and location, and the interrelated goods and services provide utility to the customer as a package. See "Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for further information on our revenue recognition policies.
Warranties. We have recognized an accrued liability for warranty obligations equal to our estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with our performance under contractual warranties. Warranty estimates include the cost of direct material and labor estimates to repair products over their warranty coverage period. Generally, estimates are based on historical experience considering known or expected changes. If we would become aware of an increase in our estimated warranty costs, additional accruals may become necessary, resulting in an increase in cost of sales. Although prior estimates have been materially correct, estimates for warranty liabilities can change based on actual versus estimated defect rates over the lifetime of the warranty coverage, a difference in actual to estimated costs to conduct repairs for the components and related labor needed, and other site related actual to estimated cost changes.
As of May 1, 2021 and May 2, 2020, we had approximately $26.0 million and $25.6 million accrued for these warranty obligations, respectively. Due to the difficulty in estimating probable costs related to certain warranty obligations, there is a reasonable likelihood that the ultimate remaining costs to remediate the warranty claims could differ materially from the recorded accrued liabilities. See "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for further information on warranties.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects those pronouncements have on our financial results, refer to "Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Daktronics, Inc. operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30 of each year. When April 30 falls on a Wednesday, the fiscal year ends on the preceding Saturday. Within each fiscal year, each quarter is comprised of 13-week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year. In each 53-week year, an additional week is added to the first quarter, and each of the last three quarters is comprised of a 13-week period. The fiscal year ended May 1, 2021 contained operating results for 52 weeks, while the fiscal year ended May 2, 2020 contained operating results for 53 weeks.
Net Sales
The following table shows information regarding net sales for the fiscal years ended May 1, 2021 and May 2, 2020:
Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Sales and orders in all business units were impacted as a result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as fiscal 2020 including 53 weeks compared to the more common 52 weeks. Fiscal 2021 contained 52 weeks.
For net sales, during fiscal 2021, we achieved a $9.3 million per week average run rate as compared to a $11.5 million per week run rate during fiscal 2020, or an approximate 19.1% decrease. The change in sales was also related to fluctuations in the timing of order bookings and related conversion to sales and caused by delays in project sites caused by COVID-19 restrictions. ﻿
For orders, during fiscal 2021, we achieved a $9.9 million per week average run rate as compared to a $11.7 million per week run rate during fiscal 2020, or an approximate 15.4% decrease. The change in orders was caused by the economic impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and the fluctuations caused by the timing of large contract orders, which causes lumpiness.
Commercial: The decrease in net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to overall low market activity in the spectacular and OOH niches, which was partly offset by an increase in net sales in the on-premise niche.
The decrease in orders for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to overall low market activity in the spectacular niche, which was partly offset by an increase in orders in the on-premise niche.
We continue to see increased adoption of video solutions in our Commercial business unit marketplace. Depending on the duration of the current economic conditions, we see opportunities for orders and sales over the coming years in our OOH, on-premise, and spectacular focused niches due to replacement cycles, expansion of dynamic messaging systems usage, our releases of new solutions, additional distribution methods, and increased market size due to the decline of digital pricing over the years as well as the desire for higher resolution technology. Due to a number of factors, such as the discretionary nature of customers committing to a system, economic dependencies, regulatory environments, competitive factors, and the uncertainty of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict orders and net sales for fiscal 2022. We expect growth in the Commercial business unit over the long-term, assuming favorable economic conditions and our success in counteracting competitive pressures.
Live Events: The decrease in net sales and orders for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to low demand for upgraded or new solutions for arenas, university venues, and sports stadiums. This decline was due to economic concerns and various other factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic causing customers to delay large expenditures.
Overall, we believe that these orders are not lost but only delayed.
We continue to see ongoing interest from venues at all levels in increasing the size and capabilities of their display systems and in the usage of dynamic messaging systems throughout their facilities in our Live Events business unit marketplace. A number of factors, such as the discretionary nature of customers committing to upgrade systems, long replacement cycles, the limited number of large custom projects, competitive factors, and the uncertainty of when venues will be allowed to seat at full capacity and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, make forecasting fiscal 2022 orders and net sales difficult. We expect continued growth in this business unit over the long-term, assuming favorable economic conditions and success in counteracting competitive pressures.
High School Park and Recreation: The decrease in net sales and orders for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to slightly lower market activity as schools held back spend during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We expect larger video systems and our classic scoring and message centers to remain in demand in fiscal 2022, primarily in high school facilities, which benefit from our sports marketing services that generate advertising revenue to fund the display systems and because of schools' desires to communicate with students and parents using these systems. Several factors, such as the potential reduction in the availability of advertising revenues, the discretionary nature of customers committing to upgrade systems, replacement cycles, competitive factors, and the uncertainty of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, make forecasting fiscal 2022 orders and net sales difficult. We expect growth in this business unit over the long-term, assuming favorable economic conditions.
Transportation: The decrease in net sales and orders for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to low demand for mass-transit and airport information displays projects due to the low level of use of these facilities during COVID-19 and the general slow-down of business activity for agencies working remotely.
Several factors, such as transportation funding, the competitive environment, customer delivery changes, and the uncertainty of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, make forecasting orders and net sales difficult for fiscal 2022. However, the stability of long-term federal transportation funding and the number of capital projects for highways and public transit that include dynamic message signs and for advertising and wayfinding use in public transport and airport terminals continue to rise. We expect continued growth in this business unit over the long-term, assuming favorable economic conditions and continued transportation funding.
International: The decrease in net sales and orders for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of low demand of large spectacular, OOH, and sport stadium projects because of reduced advertising spending and limited events held during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We expect demand for larger video systems for commercial and sports applications, indoor and outdoor OOH applications, and transportation applications to remain strong over the long-term. Macroeconomic factors, the discretionary nature of customers committing to new systems or replacements, the pace of market growth, and the uncertainty of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact order bookings and timing, making it difficult to predict order and sales levels for fiscal 2022. For the long-term, we believe the International business unit has the potential for sales growth as we penetrate markets with our established sales networks to increase our International market share, continue to enhance our tailored portfolio of product and control solution offerings, and increase the use and adoption of our technology globally.
Gross Profit and Contribution Margin
Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Gross profit is net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory, logistics related costs including tariffs and duties, consumables, personnel related costs, facilities-related costs for manufacturing locations, machinery and equipment maintenance and depreciation, site sub-contractors, warranty costs, and other service delivery expenses.
The increase in our gross profit percentage for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was the result of a $2.1 million litigation claim reversal in High School Park and Recreation and in all business units, a change of mix between service agreements and product sales and a reduction in capacity through temporary furloughs and reductions in force. In all business units, we lowered overall staffing and benefit levels and temporarily furloughed employees to achieve lower operating costs to align with the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition we received $1.8 million of COVID-19 relief governmental subsidies partially offsetting the $2.8 million of severance costs incurred to reduce our workforce. Even with the cost cutting measures, we maintained more capacity aligned to Live Events at levels that exceeded the revenue changes causing gross profit to decline in this business unit. During fiscal 2020, we experienced additional expenses of approximately $3.3 million for project delivery costs and $2.0 million in tariff related expenses, decreasing the gross profit rate for that year.
We earned a higher rate of gross profit on our service agreements due to reduced stand ready services conducted during the fiscal year ended May 1, 2021. This was due to lower on-site demand as events were not being held. We believe this higher gross profit level will not be sustained in future fiscal years. Total warranty as a percent of sales decreased to 1.4 percent for fiscal 2021 as compared to 1.9 percent during fiscal 2020.
It is difficult to project gross profit levels for fiscal 2022 because of the uncertainty regarding the level of sales, the sales mix, price strategy and timing of sales generation, the COVID-19 impact, potential inflation and availability of materials, labor, and freight, and the competitive factors in our business. We are focused on improving our gross profit margins as we execute our strategies for improved profitability, which include releasing new product designs to lower overall costs of the product; improving reliability to reduce warranty expenses; expanding our global capacity and planning; meeting customer solution expectations; and continued improvements in operational effectiveness in manufacturing, installation, and service delivery areas. Cost reductions made during the pandemic vary in permanency and may not be sustainable in future periods as orders and sales volumes recover.
Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Contribution margin is a non-GAAP measure and consists of gross profit less selling expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs, travel and entertainment expenses, facility-related costs for sales and service offices, bad debt expenses, third-party commissions and expenditures for marketing efforts, including the costs of collateral materials, conventions and trade shows, product demonstrations, customer relationship management systems, and supplies.
Contribution margin is impacted by the previously discussed sales and gross margin for each business unit. Each business unit's contribution margin was impacted as a result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as fiscal 2020 including 53 weeks compared to the more common 52 weeks. Fiscal 2021 contained 52 weeks. In addition, each business unit's contribution margin had a decrease in personnel related expenses offset by severance costs for reductions in force, as well as reductions in travel and entertainment, marketing, and convention related expenses. This was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expenses. We have reduced overall staffing and furloughed employees to achieve lower operating costs to align with the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions made during the pandemic vary in permanency and may change in future periods in future periods as orders and sales volumes recover.
Reconciliation from non-GAAP contribution margin to operating income (loss) GAAP measure is as follows:
* Percentage is not meaningful due to prior year operating loss.
Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to Fiscal Year 2020
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, other employee-related costs, professional fees, shareholder relations costs, facilities and equipment-related costs for administrative departments, training costs, and the cost of supplies.
General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2021 decreased as compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to decreases in personnel related expenses and professional fees. We have reduced overall staffing and furloughed employees to achieve lower operating costs to align with the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
We expect general and administrative expenses to increase for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 as the cost reductions made during the pandemic vary in permanency and may change in future periods in future periods as orders and sales volumes recover.
Product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, other employee-related costs, professional services, facilities costs and equipment-related costs and supplies. Product design and development investments in the near term are focused on developing or improving our video technology over a wide range of pixel pitches for both indoor and outdoor applications. These new or improved technologies are focused on varied pixel density for image quality and use, expanded product line offerings for our various markets and geographies, improved quality and reliability, and improved cost points.
Our costs for product design and development represent an allocated amount of costs based on time charges, professional services, material costs and the overhead of our engineering departments. Generally, a significant portion of our engineering time is spent on product design and development, while the rest is allocated to large contract work and included in cost of sales.
Product design and development expenses in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to decreased labor costs and professional services assigned to product design and development projects offset by severance costs for the reduction in force. We have reduced overall staffing and furloughed employees to achieve lower operating costs to align with the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect an increase in expenditures for product design and development for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to an anticipated gradual return to pre-pandemic levels. During fiscal 2022, we plan to make continued investments in our software and controller options and narrow pixel pitch LED displays throughout our various product offerings.
Other Income and Expenses
Fiscal Year 2021 as compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Interest (expense) income, net: We generate interest income through short-term cash investments, marketable securities, and product sales on an installment basis or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from displays, which result in long-term receivables. Interest expense is comprised primarily of interest costs on long-term obligations.
The change in interest (expense) income, net for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to the change in investment levels caused by the volatility of working capital needs and interest expense for our drawings on the line of credit.
Other (expense) income, net: The change in other income and expense, net for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to foreign currency volatility and the increases in the losses recorded for equity method affiliates. During fiscal 2021, we recorded equity method affiliate losses of $2.4 million as compared to $0.7 million during fiscal 2020.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was approximately 22.3 percent for fiscal year 2021. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was impacted due to tax benefits from permanent tax credits and prior year provision to return adjustments offset by and valuation allowances as well as other various permanent tax adjustments and state taxes.
Our fiscal 2020 income tax benefit was the result of permanent tax credits reduced by valuation allowances and minor pre-tax book loss creating a meaningless effective tax rate.
Our consolidated effective tax rate is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to various factors, and because we operate in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions, our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation. See "Note 12. Income Taxes" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for further information.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash increased by $40.0 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to an increase of $4.7 million in fiscal 2020, which is primarily due to cash generated by operations, a decrease in capital expenditures, and suspending our dividends and share repurchase program, offset by a $15 million outflow for financing activities which resulted from repayment of borrowings under our line of credit.﻿
Net cash provided by operating activities: Cash generated by operating activities is primarily derived from cash received from customers, offset by cash payments for inventories, subcontractors, employee related costs, and operating expense outflows. Operating cash flows consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Overall, changes in net operating assets and liabilities can be impacted by the timing of cash flows on large orders, which can cause significant short-term and seasonal fluctuations in inventory, accounts receivables, accounts payable, contract assets and liabilities, and various other operating assets and liabilities. Variability in contract assets and liabilities relates to the timing of billings on construction-type contracts and revenue recognition, which can vary significantly depending on contractual payment terms and build and installation schedules. Balances are also impacted by the seasonality of the sports market. For specific quantitative changes in operating assets and liabilities, see "Note 13. Cash Flow Information" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $66.2 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $10.8 million in fiscal 2020. The $55.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of changes in net operating assets and liabilities and an of increase of $10.4 million in net income.
Net cash used in investing activities: Net cash used in investing activities totaled $10.2 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $4.3 million in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we had $1.2 million of proceeds from sales or maturities of marketable securities compared to $25.2 million in fiscal 2020. Net proceeds of marketable securities in fiscal 2020 were utilized to cover working capital needs for changes in operating assets and liabilities. Purchases of property and equipment totaled $7.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $18.1 million in fiscal 2020. Proceeds from the sales of property and equipment totaled $3.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $0.3 million in fiscal 2020. Purchases of and loans to equity investments totaled $6.7 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to $11.7 million in fiscal 2020.
Net cash used in financing activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $15.6 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 2020. Principal payments on long-term obligations for fiscal 2021 was $0.5 million compared to $2.1 million in fiscal 2020, which was mostly related to contingent liability payments. During fiscal 2021, we paid $15.0 million on notes payable compared to borrowing on notes payable of $15.0 million in fiscal 2020. Dividends of $9.0 million, or $0.20 per share, were paid to Daktronics shareholders during fiscal 2020, while there were no dividends paid during fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2021, there were no share repurchases compared to $5.6 million of share repurchases in fiscal 2020. As part of our COVID-19 response, as announced on April 1, 2020, our Board of Directors suspended dividends and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future.
Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion: The timing and amounts of working capital changes, dividend payments, repurchases of stock in our stock repurchase program, and capital spending impact our liquidity.
Working capital was $118.4 million at May 1, 2021 and $106.0 million at May 2, 2020. The changes in working capital, particularly changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory, and contract assets and liabilities, and the sports market seasonality, can have a significant impact on the amount of net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of payments and receipts. On multimillion-dollar orders, the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to or exceed 12 months or more depending on the amount of custom work and a customer’s delivery needs. We often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders. We expect fluctuations in working capital to continue during the pandemic recovery.
We had $5.6 million of retainage on long-term contracts included in receivables and contract assets as of May 1, 2021, which has an impact on our liquidity. We expect to collect these amounts within one year. When working capital is needed, we have historically financed our cash needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements. As of May 1, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable bank loan covenants. For additional information on financing agreements, see "Note 7. Financing Agreements" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
As part of our COVID-19 response, our Board of Directors suspended dividends and share repurchases for the foreseeable future. The future reinstatement of dividends and share repurchases cannot be predicted and is at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Future dividends are also impacted by the limitations imposed in our credit facility as further described in "Note 7. Financing Agreements" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
We are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations, and we have a bonding line available through a surety company for an aggregate of $150.0 million in bonded work outstanding. If we were unable to complete the work, and our customer would call upon the bond for payment, the surety company would subrogate its loss to Daktronics. At May 1, 2021, we had $59.2 million of bonded work outstanding against this line.
Our business growth and profitability improvement strategies depend on investments in capital expenditures and strategic investments. We are projecting capital expenditures to be approximately $25 million for fiscal 2022. Projected capital expenditures include manufacturing equipment for new or enhanced product production, expanded capacity, investments in quality and reliability equipment, and continued information infrastructure investments. During fiscal 2022, we may choose to invest additional capital in our investments in affiliates to support further development in microLED and other technologies. We also evaluate and may invest in new technologies or acquire companies aligned with our business strategy.
We believe the audiovisual industry fundamentals will drive long-term growth for our business; however, for the near-term outlook, we expect our customers may continue to have disruptions and may continue to reduce or increase their spend on audiovisual systems and related services as they work through the economic and business implications of COVID-19. While it is difficult to estimate the longevity and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic impact to the economy and to our financial position, operating results, and cash flows, we believe our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations and strategies in the foreseeable future. If the pandemic impact or long-term growth extends beyond current expectations, or if we make significant strategic investments, we may need to utilize and possibly increase our credit facilities or seek other means of financing.
