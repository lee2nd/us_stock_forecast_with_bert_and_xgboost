Overview
We are a diversified consumer finance company that provides installment loan products primarily to customers with limited access to consumer credit from banks, thrifts, credit card companies, and other lenders. We operate under the name “Regional Finance” in 365 branch locations across 11 states in the Southeastern, Southwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwestern United States, serving 410,300 active accounts, as of December 31, 2020. Most of our loan products are secured, and each is structured on a fixed-rate, fixed-term basis with fully amortizing equal monthly installment payments, repayable at any time without penalty. We source our loans through our multiple channel platform, which includes our branches, centrally-managed direct mail campaigns, digital partners, retailers, and our consumer website. We operate an integrated branch model in which nearly all loans, regardless of origination channel, are serviced through our branch network. This provides us with frequent in-person contact with our customers, which we believe improves our credit performance and customer loyalty. Our goal is to consistently grow our finance receivables and to soundly manage our portfolio risk, while providing our customers with attractive and easy-to-understand loan products that serve their varied financial needs.
Our products include small, large, and retail installment loans:
•
Small Loans (≤$2,500) - As of December 31, 2020, we had 251.8 thousand small installment loans outstanding, representing $403.1 million in net finance receivables. This included 112.9 thousand small loan convenience checks, representing $157.4 million in net finance receivables.
•
Large Loans (>$2,500) - As of December 31, 2020, we had 147.4 thousand large installment loans outstanding, representing $715.2 million in net finance receivables. This included 7.5 thousand large loan convenience checks, representing $21.5 million in net finance receivables.
•
Retail Loans - As of December 31, 2020, we had 10.4 thousand retail purchase loans outstanding, representing $14.1 million in net finance receivables.
•
Optional Insurance Products - We offer optional payment and collateral protection insurance to our direct loan customers.
Small and large installment loans are our core loan products and will be the drivers of our future growth. We ceased originating automobile purchase loans in November 2017 to focus on growing our core loan portfolio, but we continue to own and service the automobile loans that we previously originated. As of December 31, 2020, we had less than one thousand automobile loans outstanding, representing $3.9 million in finance receivables. Our primary sources of revenue are interest and fee income from our loan products, of which interest and fees relating to small and large installment loans are the largest component. In addition to interest and fee income from loans, we derive revenue from optional insurance products purchased by customers of our direct loan products.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Outlook
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread market volatility and economic uncertainty. As a result of the pandemic, we experienced temporary closure of some branches due to previous state regulatory mandates and company-initiated quarantine measures. However, substantially all of our branches currently remain open, and our centralized operations continue to support our customers and our branch network. We have also implemented social distancing measures, enhanced sanitation, and supplied personal protective equipment across our branch network. As a result of the economic downturn related to the pandemic, our branches experienced a decrease in customer traffic and product demand in the second quarter of 2020, which rebounded in the second half of 2020. Net finance receivables increased $76.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to rebounding consumer demand and the execution of our new growth initiatives. Fourth quarter 2020 loan growth was also aided by our increased remote origination and loan closing capabilities that were rolled out in the second quarter of 2020. While loan growth rebounded in the second half of 2020, future consumer demand is still uncertain due to the pandemic and potential customer access to external economic stimulus measures.
During the pandemic, we have employed a data-driven approach to managing our risk, which is essential, particularly during periods of market volatility. We manage this risk through our custom risk and response scorecards, analysis of early payment activity, and detailed geographic and customer segmentation to ensure that incremental direct mail loan volume is capable of absorbing credit losses at two to three times our historical levels while still providing positive contribution margin.
In light of the heightened unemployment rate within the United States, we anticipate slowdowns in our loan collections and increased loan defaults. As a result, we have $30.4 million reserved for estimated incremental credit losses on customer accounts impacted by COVID-19. We proactively adjusted our underwriting criteria in March 2020 to adapt to the new environment and have continued to originate loans with appropriately enhanced lending criteria. As we have progressed through the pandemic and acquired additional data, we have continued to update and sharpen our underwriting standards and have paid close attention to certain geographies and industries that have been most affected by the virus and economic disruption. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 61% of our total portfolio had been originated since April 2020, the vast majority of which was subject to enhanced credit standards deployed following the outset of the pandemic.
We specifically tailored our borrower assistance programs during the second quarter of 2020 to help our customers manage their debt obligations and maintain their creditworthiness. To qualify for our borrower assistance programs, we require that our customers remain engaged and active in repaying their loans, including requiring at least one loan payment in the prior two months to qualify for a payment deferral. We are confident that these programs are having their intended effect and, in combination with government stimulus measures, have acted as an important bridge for our customers during the pandemic. Delinquency as of December 31, 2020 was down from December 31, 2019, even as borrower assistance usage returned to pre-pandemic levels and government stimulus diminished. Our contractual delinquency as a percentage of net finance receivables remained near historically low levels at 5.3% as of December 31, 2020, down from 7.0% as of December 31, 2019. However, the long-term success of these programs is unknown at this time. In the near-term, we may experience further changes to the macroeconomic assumptions within our forecast and changes to our credit loss performance outlook, both of which could lead to further changes in our allowance for credit losses, reserve rate, and provision for credit losses expense.
We proactively diversified our funding over the past few years and continue to maintain a strong liquidity profile. In the first quarter of 2021, we successfully closed a $248.7 million asset-backed securitization with a 3-year revolving period and weighted-average coupon (“WAC”) of 2.08% (replacing a prior transaction with a 2-year revolver and WAC of 4.87%). As of December 31, 2020, we had $194.4 million of immediate liquidity, comprised of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down cash from our revolving credit facilities. This represents an $82.5 million improvement in our liquidity position since December 31, 2019. In addition, we ended 2020 with $438.1 million of unused capacity on our revolving credit facilities (subject to the borrowing base). We believe our liquidity position provides us substantial runway to fund our growth initiatives and to support the fundamental operations of our business.
We continue to rely more heavily on online operations for customer access and remote work for certain of our team members, including our home office and field leadership. We have expanded our capabilities for branch team members to work from home to the extent permitted by applicable laws and to provide origination capabilities remotely in states where permitted. We also completed the rollout of a new remote loan closing process across our network in July 2020. This new capability enables our customers to extend and expand their borrowing relationship with us from the comfort and convenience of their home, while allowing us to maintain the same underwriting standards we utilize in our branches. After only six months with the new capabilities fully deployed, we completed 20% of December branch originations through the remote loan closing process, a demonstration of our ability to adapt successfully to the new operating environment while continuing to provide our customers with the best-in-class service and experience that they have come to expect from us. On the digital front, we are building and expanding upon our end-to-
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 43
end online and mobile origination capabilities for new and existing customers, along with additional digital servicing functionality, including a mobile application. Combined with remote loan closings, we believe that these new omni-channel sales and service capabilities will expand the market reach of our branches, increase our average branch receivables, and improve our revenues and operating efficiencies, while at the same time increasing customer satisfaction.
The extent to which the pandemic will ultimately impact our business and financial condition will depend on future events that are difficult to forecast, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the success of actions taken to contain, treat, and prevent the spread of the virus, the effectiveness of our borrower assistance programs and government economic stimulus measures, and the speed at which normal economic and operating conditions return.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for an update to our risk factors related to COVID-19.
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Our business is driven by several factors affecting our revenues, costs, and results of operations, including the following:
Quarterly Information and Seasonality. Our loan volume and contractual delinquency follow seasonal trends. Demand for our small and large loans is typically highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which we believe is largely due to customers borrowing money for vacation, back-to-school, and holiday spending. Loan demand has generally been the lowest during the first quarter, which we believe is largely due to the timing of income tax refunds. Delinquencies generally reach their lowest point in the first half of the year and rise in the second half of the year. In addition, the CECL accounting model requires earlier recognition of credit losses compared to the prior incurred loss approach. This could result in larger allowance for credit loss releases in periods of loan portfolio liquidation, and larger provisions for credit losses in periods of loan portfolio growth compared to prior years. Consequently, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our operating results and cash needs. However, changes in borrower assistance programs and customer access to external economic stimulus measures related to COVID-19 have impacted our typical seasonal trends for volume and delinquency.
Growth in Loan Portfolio. The revenue that we derive from interest and fees is largely driven by the balance of loans that we originate and purchase. Average net finance receivables grew 6.5% from $1.0 billion in 2019 to $1.1 billion in 2020. We source our loans through our branches, direct mail program, retail partners, digital partners, and our consumer website. Our loans are made almost exclusively in geographic markets served by our network of branches. Increasing the number of loans per branch and the number of branches we operate allows us to increase the number of loans that we are able to service. We opened fifteen new branches and consolidated eight branches in 2019. We opened nine new branches and consolidated ten branches in 2020. We can add additional branches in states where it is favorable for us to conduct business, and we have plans to continue to grow our geographic footprint and branch network.
Product Mix. We are exposed to different credit risks and charge different interest rates and fees with respect to the various types of loans we offer. Our product mix also varies to some extent by state, and we may further diversify our product mix in the future. The interest rates and fees vary from state to state, depending on the competitive environment and relevant laws and regulations.
Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses. Our results of operations are highly dependent upon the credit quality of our loan portfolio. The credit quality of our loan portfolio is the result of our ability to enforce sound underwriting standards, maintain diligent servicing of the portfolio, and respond to changing economic conditions as we grow our loan portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses estimate changed on January 1, 2020, as we adopted the CECL accounting model. See Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for more information on our allowance for credit losses.
The primary underlying factors driving the provision for credit losses for each loan type are our underwriting standards, the general economic conditions in the areas in which we conduct business, loan portfolio growth, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. In addition, the market for repossessed automobiles at auction is another underlying factor that we believe influences the provision for credit losses for loans collateralized by automobiles. We monitor these factors, and the amount and past due status of all loans, to identify trends that might require us to modify the allowance for credit losses.
Interest Rates. Our costs of funds are affected by changes in interest rates, as the interest rates that we pay on certain of our credit facilities are variable. As a component of our strategy to manage the interest rate risk associated with future interest payments on our variable-rate debt, we have purchased interest rate cap contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we held five interest rate cap contracts with an aggregate notional principal amount of $500.0 million. The interest rate caps have maturities of April
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 44
2021 ($200.0 million, 3.50% strike rate), March 2023 ($100.0 million, 1.75% strike rate), August 2023 ($50.0 million, 0.50% strike rate), October 2023 ($100.0 million, 0.50% strike rate), and November 2023 ($50.0 million, 0.25% strike rate). As of December 31, 2020, the one-month LIBOR was 0.14%. When the one-month LIBOR exceeds the strike rate, the counterparty reimburses us for the excess over the strike rate. No payment is required by us or the counterparty when the one-month LIBOR is below the strike rate. In addition, as described below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Arrangements,” the interest rate on a portion of our long-term debt is fixed. As of December 31, 2020, 57.3% of our long-term debt was at a fixed rate. In February 2021, as a component of our strategy to manage the interest rate risk associated with future interest payments on variable-rate debt, we purchased an interest rate cap contract for $0.2 million with an aggregate notional principal amount of $50.0 million. The interest rate cap matures in February 2024 with a 0.25% strike rate against the one-month LIBOR.
Operating Costs. Our financial results are impacted by the costs of operations and home office functions. Those costs are included in general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income. Our operating expense ratio (general and administrative expenses as a percentage of average net finance receivables) was 16.4% for 2020, compared to 15.6% in 2019. Fiscal 2020 included $3.1 million of executive transition costs and $0.7 million of system outage costs. We deferred $3.6 million less in loan origination costs on reduced loan volume in 2020, which increased personnel expense. We incurred $1.2 million of expenses for COVID-19 related customer communications, protective supplies, and remote work during 2020. We have also incurred $0.8 million of severance expenses related to workforce actions during 2020. These non-operating and COVID-19 related expenses impacted our operating expense ratio by 90 basis points in 2020.
Components of Results of Operations
Interest and Fee Income. Our interest and fee income consists primarily of interest earned on outstanding loans. Accrual of interest income on finance receivables is suspended when an account becomes 90 days delinquent. If the account is charged off, the accrued interest income is reversed as a reduction of interest and fee income.
Most states allow certain fees in connection with lending activities, such as loan origination fees, acquisition fees, and maintenance fees. Some states allow for higher fees while keeping interest rates lower. Loan fees are additional charges to the customer and generally are included in the annual percentage rate shown in the Truth in Lending disclosure that we make to our customers. The fees may or may not be refundable to the customer in the event of an early payoff, depending on state law. Fees are accrued to income over the life of the loan on the constant yield method.
Insurance Income, Net. Our insurance operations are a material part of our overall business and are integral to our lending activities. Insurance income, net consists primarily of earned premiums, net of certain direct costs, from the sale of various optional payment and collateral protection insurance products offered to customers who obtain loans directly from us. Insurance income, net also includes the earned premiums and direct costs associated with the non-file insurance that we purchase to protect us from credit losses where, following an event of default, we are unable to take possession of personal property collateral because our security interest is not perfected. We do not sell insurance to non-borrowers. Direct costs included in insurance income, net are claims paid, claims reserves, ceding fees, and premium taxes paid. We do not allocate to insurance income, net, any other home office or branch administrative costs associated with management of insurance operations, management of captive insurance company, marketing and selling insurance products, legal and compliance review, or internal audits.
As reinsurer, we maintain cash reserves for life insurance claims in an amount determined by the unaffiliated insurance company. As of December 31, 2020, the restricted cash balance for these cash reserves was $12.0 million. The unaffiliated insurance company maintains the reserves for non-life claims.
Other Income. Our other income consists primarily of late charges assessed on customers who fail to make a payment within a specified number of days following the due date of the payment. In addition, fees for extending the due date of a loan, returned check charges, commissions earned from the sale of an auto club product, and interest income from restricted cash are included in other income.
Provision for Credit Losses. Provisions for credit losses are charged to income in amounts that we estimate as sufficient to maintain an allowance for credit losses at an adequate level to provide for lifetime expected credit losses on the related finance receivable portfolio. Credit loss experience, current conditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, delinquency of finance receivables, loan portfolio growth, the value of underlying collateral, and management’s judgment are factors used in assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance and the resulting provision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses fluctuates so that we maintain an adequate credit loss allowance that reflects lifetime future credit losses for each finance receivable type. Changes in our delinquency and net credit loss rates may result in changes to our provision for credit losses.
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 45
Substantial adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in forecasted economic conditions or loan portfolio performance.
General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of four categories: personnel, occupancy, marketing, and other. We measure our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of average net finance receivables, which we refer to as our operating expense ratio.
Our personnel expenses are the largest component of our general and administrative expenses and consist primarily of the salaries and wages, overtime, contract labor, relocation costs, incentives, benefits, and related payroll taxes associated with all of our operations and home office employees.
Our occupancy expenses consist primarily of the cost of renting our facilities, all of which are leased, and the utility, depreciation of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures, telecommunication, data processing, and other non-personnel costs associated with operating our business.
Our marketing expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our direct mail campaigns (including postage and costs associated with selecting recipients), digital marketing, maintaining our consumer website, and some local marketing by branches. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Other expenses consist primarily of legal, compliance, audit, and consulting costs, as well as non-employee director compensation, amortization of software licenses and implementation costs, electronic payment processing costs, bank service charges, office supplies, and credit bureau charges. For a discussion regarding how risks and uncertainties associated with the current regulatory environment may impact our future expenses, net income, and overall financial condition, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Interest Expense. Our interest expense consists primarily of paid and accrued interest for long-term debt, unused line fees, and amortization of debt issuance costs on long-term debt. Interest expense also includes costs attributable to the interest rate caps that we use to manage our interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps are reflected in interest expense.
Income Taxes. Income taxes consist of state and federal income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period in which the change occurs, and the effects of future tax rate changes are recognized in the period in which the enactment of new rates occurs.

Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our results of operations, both in dollars and as a percentage of average net finance receivables:
Information explaining the changes in our results of operations from year-to-year is provided in the following pages.
Comparison of December 31, 2020, Versus December 31, 2019
The following discussion and table describe the changes in finance receivables by product type:
•
Small Loans (≤$2,500) - Small loans outstanding decreased by $64.6 million, or 13.8%, to $403.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $467.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of reduced loan demand due to COVID-19 and the general transition of small loan customers to large loans.
•
Large Loans (>$2,500) - Large loans outstanding increased by $83.1 million, or 13.2%, to $715.2 million at December 31, 2020, from $632.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased marketing and the transition of small loan customers to large loans, partially offset by reduced loan demand due to COVID-19.
•
Automobile Loans - Automobile loans outstanding decreased by $5.8 million, or 59.7%, to $3.9 million at December 31, 2020, from $9.6 million at December 31, 2019. We ceased originating automobile loans in November 2017 to focus on growing our core loan portfolio.
•
Retail Loans - Retail loans outstanding decreased $10.0 million, or 41.5%, to $14.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $24.1 million at December 31, 2019.
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 47
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020, Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net Income. Net income decreased $18.0 million, or 40.2%, to $26.7 million in 2020, from $44.7 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses of $24.2 million and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $19.3 million, offset by an increase in revenue of $18.2 million, a decrease in income taxes of $5.1 million, and a decrease in interest expense of $2.3 million.
Revenue. Total revenue increased $18.2 million, or 5.1%, to $373.9 million in 2020, from $355.7 million in 2019. The components of revenue are explained in greater detail below.
Interest and Fee Income. Interest and fee income increased $14.0 million, or 4.4%, to $335.2 million in 2020, from $321.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 6.5% increase in average net finance receivables, offset by a 0.6% decrease in average yield.
The following table sets forth the average net finance receivables balance and average yield for our loan products:
Small loan yields decreased 0.8% compared to 2019 as more of our small loan customers have originated loans with larger balances and longer maturities, which typically are priced at lower interest rates. Large loan yields increased 0.1% compared to 2019 as a result of adjusted pricing that reflects current market conditions.
As a result of our focus on large loan growth over the last several years, the large loan portfolio has grown faster than the rest of our loan products, and we expect that this trend will continue in the future. Over time, large loan growth will change our product mix, which will reduce our total interest and fee yield.
We continue to originate new loans with enhanced lending criteria. Demand for our loan products has continued to recover, as total originations increased to $358.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, from a low of $172.2 million in the second quarter of 2020. The year-over-year change in originations consistently improved over the second half of 2020. We expect any government stimulus in early 2021 will reduce loan demand. As we experienced in 2020, we expect a strong second half increase in loan demand as vaccinations become more widespread and the economy begins to re-open more fully. The following table represents the amount of loan originations and refinancing, net of unearned finance charges:
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 48
The following table summarizes the components of the increase in interest and fee income:
The $14.0 million increase in interest and fee income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by growth of our average net finance receivables, offset by a decrease in yield, as illustrated in the table above. We expect future increases in interest and fee income to continue to be driven primarily from growth in our average net finance receivables.
Insurance Income, Net. Insurance income, net increased $7.5 million, or 36.2%, to $28.3 million in 2020, from $20.8 million in 2019. Insurance income, net represented 2.6% and 2.1% of average net finance receivables in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In both 2020 and 2019, personal property insurance premiums represented the largest component of aggregate earned insurance premiums. Life insurance claims expense and non-file insurance claims expense represented the largest component of direct insurance expenses in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table summarizes the components of insurance income, net:
Fiscal 2020 earned premiums increased by $7.3 million and claims, reserves, and certain direct expenses decreased by $0.3 million, in each case compared to 2019. The increase in earned premiums was primarily due to loan growth and adjusted pricing. Claims, reserves, and certain direct expenses were impacted by a $3.0 million decrease in non-file insurance claims expense due to fewer bankruptcy filings by our customers during 2020. These decreases were offset by a $1.3 million increase in life insurance claims expense and a $1.6 million increase in unemployment insurance claims expense.
Other Income. Other income decreased $3.4 million, or 24.7%, to $10.3 million in 2020, from $13.7 million in 2019, due to a $2.0 million decrease in late charges, a $0.6 million decrease in interest income from restricted cash, a $0.5 million decrease in commissions earned from the sale of our auto club product, and a $0.3 million decrease in extension fee income. As large loans continue to represent a greater percentage of our total loan portfolio and we continue to leverage electronic payment options, we expect lower late charges per active account. Other income represented 1.0% and 1.4% of average net finance receivables in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Provision for Credit Losses. Our provision for credit losses increased $24.2 million, or 24.3%, to $123.8 million in 2020, from $99.6 million in 2019. The increase was due to provision for credit losses related to COVID-19 of $30.4 million and an increase in net credit losses of $0.4 million, offset by $6.6 million less provision primarily due to less portfolio growth in 2020 compared to 2019.
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 49
The provision for credit losses as a percentage of average net finance receivables was 11.5% in 2020, compared to 9.9% in 2019. The 2020 percentage included a 2.8% impact from the $30.4 million provision for credit losses related to COVID-19. The increase in the provision for credit losses is explained in greater detail below.
Allowance for Credit Losses. We evaluate delinquency and losses in each of our loan products in establishing the allowance for credit losses. The following table sets forth our allowance for credit losses compared to the related finance receivables as of the end of the periods indicated:
Our methodology to estimate expected credit losses utilized macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2020, which incorporated the potential impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the economy. Our forecast utilized economic projections from a major rating service and considered several macroeconomic stress scenarios, with our final forecast assuming unemployment of 9% at the end of 2021. The macroeconomic scenario was adjusted for the potential benefits of internal borrower assistance programs and the Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law in December 2020. During 2020, we increased the allowance for credit losses by $27.7 million, which included a $30.4 million reserve related to the economic impact of COVID-19, offset by a base reserve release of $2.7 million. As of December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net finance receivables of 13.2% included 2.7% related to the $30.4 million impact from COVID-19.
Net Credit Losses. Net credit losses increased $0.4 million, or 0.4%, to $96.1 million in 2020, from $95.7 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $65.4 million increase in average net finance receivables in 2020, offset by historically low delinquency levels. Net credit losses as a percentage of average net finance receivables were 8.9% in 2020, compared to 9.5% in 2019.
Delinquency Performance Our contractual delinquency as a percentage of net finance receivables improved to 5.3% as of December 31, 2020, from 7.0% as of December 31, 2019. Our credit performance continues to be strong, as a result of the quality and adaptability of our underwriting criteria, custom scorecards, and borrower assistance programs, as well as the bridge provided by government stimulus. We expect that recent government stimulus will keep delinquencies muted for at least the first quarter of 2021 and perhaps longer, depending on the level of additional stimulus.
The following tables include delinquency balances by aging category and by product:
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 50
General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses, comprising expenses for personnel, occupancy, marketing, and other expenses, increased $19.3 million, or 12.3%, to $176.3 million in 2020 from $157.0 million in 2019. Our operating expense ratio increased to 16.4% in 2020, from 15.6% in 2019. Our operating expense ratio for 2020 included several non-operating and COVID-19 related expenses. Fiscal 2020 included $3.1 million of executive transition costs and $0.7 million of system outage costs. We deferred $3.6 million less in loan origination costs on reduced loan volume, which increased personnel expense in 2020 compared to 2019. We incurred $1.2 million of expenses for COVID-19 related customer communications and protective measures in our branches. As we repositioned the business for future growth, we adjusted our workforce in the third quarter of 2020 and incurred $0.8 million of non-operating severance expenses. These increased expenses impacted our operating expense ratio by 90 basis points in 2020. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses is explained in greater detail below.
Personnel. The largest component of general and administrative expenses is personnel expense, which increased $15.6 million, or 16.6%, to $109.6 million in 2020, from $94.0 million in 2019. Labor expense increased $6.6 million primarily due to added headcount to effectively service average net finance receivables growth of 6.5% since December 31, 2019. We deferred $3.6 million less in loan origination costs compared to 2019, which increased personnel expense. Additional increases include executive transition costs of $3.0 million, corporate incentive costs of $1.8 million, and branch incentive costs of $0.6 million.
Occupancy. Occupancy expenses remained constant at $22.6 million during both 2020 and 2019. Telecommunication expenses decreased $1.4 million as a result of our cost management actions. This decrease was offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $0.7 million, an increase in COVID-19 related expenses of $0.6 million, and an increase in rent expense of $0.3 million.
Marketing. Marketing expenses increased $2.2 million, or 26.2%, to $10.4 million in 2020, from $8.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased activity in our direct mail campaigns to support growth from existing and expanded segments of our risk-response model, which we believe will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. We expect to maintain an increased level of marketing spend in 2021.
In the latter half of March and April 2020, we temporarily paused direct mail and digital marketing aimed at customer acquisition. We restarted our marketing campaigns in the second quarter after reviewing our credit models and tightening our underwriting parameters where appropriate. As a result, we experienced a rebound in our direct mail and digital volume in the second half of 2020. We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 with $86.6 million of direct mail and digital originations, an increase from $76.3 million in the prior-year period.
Other Expenses. Other expenses increased $1.6 million, or 4.9%, to $33.8 million in 2020, from $32.2 million in 2019. We frequently experience increases in other expenses including legal and settlement expenses, external fraud, collections expense, bank fees, and certain professional expenses as we grow our loan portfolio and expand our market footprint.
Interest Expense. Interest expense on long-term debt decreased $2.3 million, or 5.7%, to $37.9 million in 2020, from $40.1 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of debt and a decrease in the average balance of our long-term debt facilities. The average cost of our total long-term debt decreased 0.58% to 5.19% in 2020, from 5.77% in 2019, primarily reflecting the lower rate environment.
Income Taxes. Income taxes decreased $5.1 million, or 35.5%, to $9.2 million in 2020, from $14.3 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $23.1 million decrease in pre-tax income compared to 2019. Our effective tax rate increased to 25.6% in 2020, compared to 24.2% in 2019. The increase was primarily related to the impact of non-deductible executive compensation (including executive transition costs) under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019, Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2018
For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (which was filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020), which comparison is incorporated by reference herein.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary cash needs relate to the funding of our lending activities and, to a lesser extent, expenditures relating to improving our technology infrastructure and expanding and maintaining our branch locations. We have historically financed, and plan to continue to finance, our short-term and long-term operating liquidity and capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our debt facilities, including our senior revolving credit facility, revolving warehouse credit facility, and asset-backed securitization transactions, all of which are described below. We are continuing to seek ways to diversify our long-term funding sources. We had a funded debt-to-equity ratio (long-term debt divided by total stockholders’ equity) of 2.8 to 1.0 and a stockholders’ equity ratio (total stockholders’ equity as a percentage of total assets) of 24.7% as of December 31, 2020.
We believe that cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our long-term debt facilities will be adequate to fund our business for the next twelve months, including initial operating losses of new branches and finance receivable growth of new and existing branches. However, we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business and will continue to assess our liquidity needs as the situation evolves.
From time to time, we have extended the maturity date of and increased the borrowing limits under our senior revolving credit facility. While we have successfully obtained such extensions and increases in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so if and when needed in the future. In addition, the revolving periods of our warehouse credit facility, RMIT 2019-1, and RMIT 2020-1 securitizations (each as described below) end in April 2021, October 2021, and September 2023, respectively. The revolving period of our RMIT 2018-2 securitization (as described below) ended in December 2020. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure an extension of the warehouse credit facility or close additional securitization transactions if and when needed in the future.
Share Repurchase and Dividends.
In October 2020, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized a new stock repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to $30.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or through other structures in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The authorization was effective immediately and extends through October 22, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had repurchased 435 thousand shares of common stock at a total cost of $12.0 million.
The Board may in its discretion declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock. Total dividends declared were $0.20 per common share during 2020. Prior to the three months ended December 31, 2020, no dividends were declared. In February 2021, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 12, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 23, 2021. The declaration, amount, and payment of any future cash dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board.
While we intend to pay our quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and the Board may choose not to continue to declare dividends in the future.
Cash Flow.
Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $172.6 million, compared to $165.1 million provided by operating activities in 2019, a net increase of $7.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth in our business described above, which produced an increase in net income, before provision for credit losses.
Investing Activities. Investing activities consist of originations and purchases of finance receivables, purchases of intangible assets, and purchases of property and equipment for new and existing branches. Net cash used in investing activities in
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 52
2020 was $98.8 million, compared to $275.6 million in 2019, a net decrease of $176.8 million. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to decreased net originations of finance receivables.
Financing Activities. Financing activities consist of borrowings and payments on our outstanding indebtedness. In 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $58.3 million, an increase of $175.2 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $116.9 million in 2019. The increase in cash used was primarily a result of an increase in net payments on debt instruments of $187.0 million and a $2.2 million increase in cash dividends, offset by a $13.0 million decrease in the repurchase of common stock.
Financing Arrangements.
Senior Revolving Credit Facility. In September 2019, we amended and restated our senior revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the availability under the facility from $638 million to $640 million and extend the maturity of the facility from June 2020 to September 2022. The facility has an accordion provision that allows for the expansion of the facility to $650 million. Excluding the receivables held by our variable interest entities (each, a “VIE”), the senior revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our finance receivables and equity interests of the majority of our subsidiaries. Advances on the senior revolving credit facility are capped at 85% of eligible secured finance receivables, 80% of eligible unsecured finance receivables, and 60% of eligible delinquent renewals (84% of eligible secured finance receivables, 79% of eligible unsecured finance receivables, and 59% of eligible delinquent renewals as of December 31, 2020). As of December 31, 2020, we had $186.3 million of available liquidity under the facility and held $8.1 million in unrestricted cash. Borrowings under the facility bear interest, payable monthly, at rates equal to one-month LIBOR, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, plus a 3.00% margin, increasing to 3.25% when the availability percentage is below 10%. The one-month LIBOR rate was 0.14% and 1.76% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amended and restated facility provides for a process to transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark in certain circumstances. We pay an unused line fee between 0.375% and 0.65% based upon the average outstanding balance of the facility.
Our long-term debt under the senior revolving credit facility was $286.1 million as of December 31, 2020. In advance of its September 2022 maturity date, we intend to extend the maturity date of the amended and restated senior revolving credit facility or take other appropriate action to address repayment upon maturity. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and the filings referenced therein for a discussion of risks related to our amended and restated senior revolving credit facility, including refinancing risk.
Variable Interest Entity Debt. As part of our overall funding strategy, we have transferred certain finance receivables to affiliated VIEs for asset-backed financing transactions, including securitizations. The following debt arrangements are issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, SPEs, which are considered VIEs under GAAP and are consolidated into the financial statements of their primary beneficiary. We are considered to be the primary beneficiary because we have (i) power over the significant activities through our role as servicer of the finance receivables under each debt arrangement and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns that could be significant through our interest in the monthly residual cash flows of the SPEs.
These long-term debts are supported by the expected cash flows from the underlying collateralized finance receivables. Collections on these finance receivables are remitted to restricted cash collection accounts, which totaled $46.6 million and $39.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash inflows from the finance receivables are distributed to the lenders/investors, the service providers, and/or the residual interest that we own in accordance with a monthly contractual priority of payments. The SPEs pay a servicing fee to us, which is eliminated in consolidation. Distributions from the SPEs to us are permitted under the debt arrangements.
At each sale of receivables from our affiliates to the SPEs, we make certain representations and warranties about the quality and nature of the collateralized receivables. The debt arrangements require us to repurchase the receivables in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which the representations and warranties made by us concerning the quality and characteristics of the receivables are inaccurate. Assets transferred to SPEs are legally isolated from us and our affiliates, and the claims of our and our affiliates’ creditors. Further, the assets of each SPE are owned by such SPE and are not available to satisfy the debts or other obligations of us or any of our affiliates. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and the filings referenced therein for a discussion of risks related to our variable interest entity debt.
Revolving Warehouse Credit Facility. In October 2019, we and our wholly-owned SPE, Regional Management Receivables II, LLC (“RMR II”), amended the credit agreement that provides for a $125 million revolving warehouse credit facility to RMR II. The amendment extended the date at which the facility converts to an amortizing loan and the termination date to April 2021 and April 2022, respectively. The facility has an accordion provision that allows for the expansion of the facility to $150 million. The debt is secured by finance receivables and other related assets that we purchased from our affiliates, which we then sold and
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 53
transferred to RMR II. Advances on the facility are capped at 80% of eligible finance receivables. Borrowings under the facility bear interest, payable monthly, at a blended rate equal to three-month LIBOR, with a LIBOR floor of 0.25%, plus a margin of 2.15% (2.20% prior to the October 2019 amendment). The three-month LIBOR was 0.24% and 1.91% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. RMR II pays an unused commitment fee between 0.35% and 0.85% based upon the average daily utilization of the facility. As of December 31, 2020, our long-term debt under the credit facility was $42.1 million.
RMIT 2018-1 Securitization. In June 2018, we, our wholly-owned SPE, Regional Management Receivables III, LLC (“RMR III”), and our indirect wholly-owned SPE, Regional Management Issuance Trust 2018-1 (“RMIT 2018-1”), completed a private offering and sale of $150 million of asset-backed notes. Prior to maturity in July 2027, we could redeem the notes in full, but not in part, at our option on any remaining note payment date. In September 2020, we and RMR III exercised the right to make an optional principal repayment in full, and in connection with such prepayment, the securitization terminated in September 2020.
RMIT 2018-2 Securitization. In December 2018, we, our wholly-owned SPE, RMR III, and our indirect wholly-owned SPE, Regional Management Issuance Trust 2018-2 (“RMIT 2018-2”), completed a private offering and sale of $130 million of asset-backed notes. The transaction consisted of the issuance of four classes of fixed-rate asset-backed notes by RMIT 2018-2. The asset-backed notes are secured by finance receivables and other related assets that RMR III purchased from us, which RMR III then sold and transferred to RMIT 2018-2. The notes had a revolving period through December 2020 and have a final maturity date in January 2028. Borrowings under the RMIT 2018-2 securitization bear interest, payable monthly, at a weighted-average rate of 4.87%. Prior to maturity in January 2028, we could redeem the notes in full, but not in part, at our option on any note payment date on or after the payment date occurring in January 2021. No payments of principal of the notes were made during the revolving period. As of December 31, 2020, our long-term debt under the securitization was $130.3 million. See Note 20, “Subsequent Events” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information regarding the termination of this facility following the end of the year.
RMIT 2019-1 Securitization. In October 2019, we, our wholly-owned SPE, RMR III, and our indirect wholly-owned SPE, Regional Management Issuance Trust 2019-1 (“RMIT 2019-1”), completed a private offering and sale of $130 million of asset-backed notes. The transaction consisted of the issuance of three classes of fixed-rate asset-backed notes by RMIT 2019-1. The asset-backed notes are secured by finance receivables and other related assets that RMR III purchased from us, which RMR III then sold and transferred to RMIT 2019-1. The notes have a revolving period ending in October 2021, with a final maturity date in November 2028. Borrowings under the RMIT 2019-1 securitization bear interest, payable monthly, at a weighted-average rate of 3.17%. Prior to maturity in November 2028, we may redeem the notes in full, but not in part, at our option on any note payment date on or after the payment date occurring in November 2021. No payments of principal of the notes will be made during the revolving period. As of December 31, 2020, our long-term debt under the securitization was $130.2 million.
RMIT 2020-1 Securitization. In September 2020, we, our wholly-owned SPE, RMR III, and our indirect wholly-owned SPE, Regional Management Issuance Trust 2020-1 (“RMIT 2020-1”), completed a private offering and sale of $180 million of asset-backed notes. The transaction consisted of the issuance of four classes of fixed-rate asset-backed notes by RMIT 2020-1. The asset-backed notes are secured by finance receivables and other related assets that RMR III purchased from us, which RMR III then sold and transferred to RMIT 2020-1. The notes have a revolving period ending in September 2023, with a final maturity date in October 2030. Borrowings under the RMIT 2020-1 securitization bear interest, payable monthly, at a weighted-average rate of 2.85%. Prior to maturity in October 2030, we may redeem the notes in full, but not in part, at our option on any business day on or after the payment date occurring in October 2023. No payments of principal of the notes will be made during the revolving period. As of December 31, 2020, our long-term debt under the securitization was $180.2 million.
RMIT 2021-1 Securitization. See Note 20, “Subsequent Events” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information regarding the completion of a private offering and sale of $248.7 million of asset-backed notes following the end of the year.
Our debt arrangements are subject to certain covenants, including monthly and annual reporting, maintenance of specified interest coverage and debt ratios, restrictions on distributions, limitations on other indebtedness, maintenance of a minimum allowance for credit losses, and certain other restrictions. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
We expect that the LIBOR reference rate will be phased out by the end of 2021. Both our senior revolving credit facility and revolving warehouse credit facility use LIBOR as a benchmark in determining the cost of funds borrowed. Our senior revolving credit facility provides for a process to transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark, if necessary. We plan to continue to work with our banking partners to modify our credit agreements to contemplate the cessation of the LIBOR reference rate. We will also continue to work to identify a replacement rate to LIBOR and look to adjust the pricing structure of our facilities as needed.
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 54
Restricted Cash Reserve Accounts.
Revolving Warehouse Credit Facility. The credit agreement governing the revolving warehouse credit facility requires that we maintain a 1% cash reserve based upon the ending finance receivables balance of the facility. As of December 31, 2020, the warehouse facility cash reserve requirement totaled $0.5 million. The warehouse facility is supported by the expected cash flows from the underlying collateralized finance receivables. Collections are remitted to a restricted cash collection account, which totaled $2.6 million as of December 31, 2020.
RMIT 2018-2 Securitization. As required under the transaction documents governing the RMIT 2018-2 securitization, we deposited $1.4 million of cash proceeds into a restricted cash reserve account at closing, which remained until the termination of the facility in February 2021. The securitization was supported by the expected cash flows from the underlying collateralized finance receivables. Collections were remitted to a restricted cash collection account, which totaled $12.8 million as of December 31, 2020. See Note 20, “Subsequent Events” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information regarding the termination of this facility following the end of the year.
RMIT 2019-1 Securitization. As required under the transaction documents governing the RMIT 2019-1 securitization, we deposited $1.4 million of cash proceeds into a restricted cash reserve account at closing. The securitization is supported by the expected cash flows from the underlying collateralized finance receivables. Collections are remitted to a restricted cash collection account, which totaled $14.1 million as of December 31, 2020.
RMIT 2020-1 Securitization. As required under the transaction documents governing the RMIT 2020-1 securitization, we deposited $1.9 million of cash proceeds into a restricted cash reserve account at closing. The securitization is supported by the expected cash flows from the underlying collateralized finance receivables. Collections are remitted to a restricted cash collection account, which totaled $17.1 million as of December 31, 2020.
RMC Reinsurance. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd., is required to maintain cash reserves against life insurance policies ceded to it, as determined by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2020, cash reserves for reinsurance were $12.0 million.
Interest Rate Caps.
As a component of our strategy to manage the interest rate risk associated with future interest payments on our variable-rate debt, we have purchased interest rate cap contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we held five interest rate cap contracts with an aggregate notional principal amount of $500.0 million. The interest rate caps have maturities of April 2021 ($200.0 million, 3.50% strike rate), March 2023 ($100.0 million, 1.75% strike rate), August 2023 ($50.0 million, 0.50% strike rate), October 2023 ($100.0 million, 0.50% strike rate), and November 2023 ($50.0 million, 0.25% strike rate). As of December 31, 2020, the one-month LIBOR was 0.14%. When the one-month LIBOR exceeds the strike rate, the counterparty reimburses us for the excess over the strike rate. No payment is required by us or the counterparty when the one-month LIBOR is below the strike rate. In February 2021, as a component of our strategy to manage the interest rate risk associated with future interest payments on variable-rate debt, we purchased an interest rate cap contract for $0.2 million with an aggregate notional principal amount of $50.0 million. The interest rate cap matures in February 2024 with a 0.25% strike rate against the one-month LIBOR.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd., is required to maintain cash reserves against life insurance policies ceded to it, as determined by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2020, the cash reserves were $12.0 million.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 55
Impact of Inflation
Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost, except for interest rate caps, which are carried at fair value. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the consumer finance industry. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods indicated in the financial statements. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and that involve a higher degree of complexity and management judgment.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
The FASB issued an accounting update in June 2016 to change the impairment model for estimating credit losses on financial assets. The previous incurred loss impairment model required the recognition of credit losses when it was probable that a loss had been incurred. The incurred loss model was replaced by the CECL model, which requires entities to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on financial instruments and to record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. The CECL model requires earlier recognition of credit losses as compared to the incurred loss approach. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020.
The allowance for credit losses is based on historical credit experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The historical loss experience is adjusted for quantitative and qualitative factors that are not fully reflected in the historical data. In determining our estimate of expected credit losses, we evaluate information related to credit metrics, changes in our lending strategies and underwriting practices, and the current and forecasted direction of the economic and business environment. These metrics include, but are not limited to, loan portfolio mix and growth, unemployment, credit loss trends, delinquency trends, changes in underwriting, and operational risks.
We selected a static pool Probability of Default (“PD”) / Loss Given Default (“LGD”) model to estimate our base allowance for credit losses, in which the estimated loss is equal to the product of PD and LGD. Historical static pools of net finance receivables are tracked over the term of the pools to identify the incidences of loss (PDs) and the average severity of losses (LGDs).
To enhance the precision of the allowance for credit loss estimate, we evaluate our finance receivable portfolio on a pool basis and segment each pool of finance receivables with similar credit risk characteristics. As part of our evaluation, we consider loan portfolio characteristics such as product type, loan size, loan term, internal or external credit scores, delinquency status, geographical location, and vintage. Based on analysis of historical loss experience, we selected the following segmentation: product type, Fair Isaac Corporation score, and delinquency status.
We account for certain finance receivables that have been modified by bankruptcy proceedings or company loss mitigation policies using a discounted cash flows approach to properly reserve for customer concessions (rate reductions and term extensions).
As finance receivables are originated, provisions for credit losses are recorded in amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance for credit losses at an adequate level to provide for estimated losses over the contractual life of the finance receivables (considering the effect of prepayments). Subsequent changes to the contractual terms that are a result of re-underwriting are not included in the finance receivable’s contractual life (considering the effect of prepayments). We use our segmentation loss experience to forecast expected credit losses. Historical information about losses generally provides a basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. We also consider the need to adjust historical information to reflect the extent to which current conditions differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. These adjustments to historical loss information may be qualitative or quantitative in nature.
Reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts are required for our allowance for credit loss model. We engaged a major rating service to assist with compiling a reasonable and supportable forecast. We review macroeconomic forecasts to use in
Regional Management Corp. | 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 56
our allowance for credit losses. We adjust the historical loss experience by relevant qualitative factors for these expectations. We do not require reversion adjustments, as the contractual lives of our loan portfolio (considering the effect of prepayments) are shorter than our available forecast periods.
We charge credit losses against the allowance when an account reaches 180 days contractually delinquent, subject to certain exceptions. Our non-titled customer accounts in a confirmed bankruptcy are charged off in the month following the bankruptcy notification or at 60 days contractually delinquent, subject to certain exceptions. Deceased borrower accounts are charged off in the month following the proper notification of passing, with the exception of borrowers with credit life insurance. Subsequent recoveries of amounts charged off, if any, are credited to the allowance.
Income Recognition.
Interest income is recognized using the interest method (constant yield method). Therefore, we recognize revenue from interest at an equal rate over the term of the loan. Unearned finance charges on pre-compute contracts are rebated to customers utilizing statutory methods, which in many cases is the sum-of-the-years’ digits method. The difference between income recognized under the constant yield method and the statutory method is recognized as an adjustment to interest income at the time of rebate. Accrual of interest income on finance receivables is suspended when an account becomes 90 days delinquent. If the account is charged off, the accrued interest income is reversed as a reduction of interest and fee income.
We recognize income on credit life insurance, credit property insurance, and automobile insurance using the sum-of-the-years’ digits or straight-line methods over the terms of the policies. We recognize income on credit accident and health insurance using the average of the sum-of-the-years’ digits and the straight-line methods over the terms of the policies. We recognize income on credit involuntary unemployment insurance using the straight-line method over the terms of the policies. Rebates are computed using statutory methods, which in many cases match the GAAP method, and where it does not match, the difference between the GAAP method and the statutory method is recognized in income at the time of rebate. Fee income for non-file insurance is recognized using the sum-of-the-years’ digits method over the loan term.
Charges for late fees are recognized as income when collected.
Share-Based Compensation.
We measure compensation cost for share-based awards at estimated fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the closing stock price on the date of grant as the fair value of restricted stock awards. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate. We estimate volatility using our historical stock prices. The risk-free rate is based on the zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond rate for the expected term of the award on the grant date. The expected term is calculated by using the simplified method (average of the vesting and original contractual terms) due to insufficient historical data to estimate the expected term. In addition, the estimation of share-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised.
Income Taxes.
We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effects of future tax rate changes are recognized in the period when the enactment of new rates occurs.
We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the consolidated financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority.
We recognize the tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise or vesting of share-based awards in the income tax line of our consolidated statements of income.
