Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Our two lead product candidates are, SNDX-5613 and SNDX-6352, or axatilimab. We are developing SNDX-5613, targeting the binding interaction of menin with the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein for the treatment of MLL-rearranged, or MLLr, acute leukemias and nucleophosmin 1, or NPM1, mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as axatilimab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the colony stimulating factor 1, or CSF-1 receptor. We have deprioritized the development of entinostat, our once-weekly, oral, small molecule, Class I HDAC inhibitor, to focus resources on advancing the remainder of our pipeline. We plan to continue to leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional therapeutics to expand our pipeline.
We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any product revenues from product sales to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not and have never been profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2005. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we reported a net loss of $73.2 million, $56.0 million and $74.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $77.1 million, $56.0 million and $74.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $568.6 million, which included non-cash charges for stock-based compensation, preferred stock accretion and extinguishment charges. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $293.1 million.
Pipeline Updates
SNDX-5613
We plan to share data from the Phase 1 AUGMENT-101 trial of SNDX-5613, our highly selective, oral menin inhibitor, in patients with mixed lineage leukemia rearranged (MLL-r) and nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutant acute leukemias late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2021. Additional details regarding the presentation, which will feature the trial’s principal investigator, Eytan M. Stein, M.D. Assistant Attending Physician and Director, Program for Drug Development in Leukemia, Department of Medicine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, will be announced in the coming weeks. We remain on track to initiate the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second quarter of 2021, which could potentially serve as the basis for a regulatory filing.
Axatilimab
At the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2020, we reported updated data from its Phase 1 trial of axatilimab, its anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody, in patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Data demonstrated deep, durable responses and multiorgan clinical benefit in patients refractory to multiple therapeutic agents.
We announced that the pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses and schedules of axatilimab in patients with cGVHD, began enrolling earlier this quarter. The primary endpoint will assess objective response rate based on the 2014 NIH consensus criteria for GVHD, with key secondary endpoints including duration of response and improvement in modified Lee Symptom Scale score. We expect to report topline data in 2023.
COVID-19 Business Update
We have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business. While we are not experiencing financial impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation as we evolve our business continuity plans and response strategy. In March 2020, our workforce transitioned to working remotely. We are currently considering plans to reopen our offices to allow employees to return to the office, which will be based on an approach that is principles-based and local in design, with a focus on employee safety and optimal work environment.
Supply Chain
We are working closely our third-party manufacturers, distributors and other partners to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our product supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to have adequate supplies of SNDX-5613 and axatilimab. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for an extended period of time and begins to impact essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery or if it results in facility closures facility closures for cleaning and/or insufficient staff, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our products, and to continue our clinical trial operations.
Clinical Development
With respect to clinical development, we have taken measures to implement remote and virtual approaches, including remote patient monitoring where possible, to maintain patient safety and trial continuity and to preserve study integrity. We have not yet, but may experience, a disruption or delay in our ability to initiate trial sites and enroll and assess patients. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we anticipate a potential impact on our ability to maintain patient enrollment in the AUGMENT-101 and cGVHD trials. We could also see an impact on the ability to supply study drug, report trial results, or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time, we could experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
Corporate Development
With our strong cash balance, we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to make planned investments in our business this year in support of our long-term growth strategy. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 11, 2021 will fund our current operating plans through at least the next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations.
Other Financial and Corporate Impacts
While we continue to evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business operations and financial results, our clinical development and regulatory efforts, our corporate development objectives and the value of and market for our common stock, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States, Europe and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease. For example, if remote work policies for certain portions of our business, or that of our business partners, are extended longer than we currently expect, we may need to reassess our priorities and our corporate objectives for the year.
Financial Overview
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any product revenues. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to obtain marketing approval of and successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 have been solely derived from our license agreement with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., or KKC, under which we granted KKC an exclusive license to develop and commercialize entinostat in Japan and Korea, or the KKC license agreement. In 2015, we received a $25.0 million upfront payment from KKC, inclusive of an equity investment. We allocated $17.3 million of the upfront payment to the license fee, and such fee is being recognized as revenue ratably over our expected performance period (currently expected to be through 2029). The balance of the upfront payment of $7.7 million was allocated to KKC purchase of shares of our convertible preferred stock.
In October 2017, KKC enrolled the first Japanese patient into a local pivotal study of entinostat for the treatment of hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. In accordance with the terms of the KKC License Agreement, in December 2017 we received a $5.0 million milestone payment from KKC for achievement of the development milestone.
Research and Development
Since our inception, we have primarily focused on our clinical development programs. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements related to our clinical trials, including the costs for investigative sites and contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct our clinical trials;
•
employee-related expenses associated with our research and development activities, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses;
•
manufacturing process-development, clinical supplies and technology-transfer expenses;
•
license fees and milestone payments under our license agreements;
•
consulting fees paid to third parties;
•
allocated facilities and overhead expenses; and
•
costs associated with regulatory operations and regulatory compliance requirements.
Internal and external research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. Cost-sharing amounts received by us are recorded as reductions to research and development expense. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or other information provided to us by our vendors.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of late-stage clinical trials. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance the development of our product candidates. The amount of research and development expenses allocated to external spending will continue to grow, while we expect our internal spending to grow at a slower and more controlled pace. From inception through December 31, 2020, we have incurred $305.2 million in research and development expenses.
It is difficult to determine, with certainty, the duration and completion costs of our current or future preclinical programs, clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
per patient costs;
•
the number of patients that participate;
•
the number of sites;
•
the countries in which the studies and trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient monitoring;
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates; and
•
timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.
In addition, the probability of success for each drug product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates for the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows from these potential product candidates may commence. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, non-cash stock-based compensation and travel expenses, for our employees in executive, finance, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expenses and accounting, tax, legal and consulting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and related expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of our product candidates.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on operating and capital leases.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our term loan, operational and capital leases.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed in Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
For license fee revenues, we applied and may continue to apply significant judgment to our KKC Agreement. We evaluated whether our contractual obligations represented distinct performance obligations. Such evaluation required judgment since it was made from the customer’s perspective. We determined that our performance obligations under the collaboration at contract inception were not distinct and represented a single performance obligation. The KKC agreement also includes variable consideration. We assess variable consideration at each reporting period as to whether it is not subject to significant future reversal and, therefore, should be included in the transaction price. For development milestones related to the KKC Agreement, we do not take a substantive role or control the research, development or commercialization of any products generated by KKC. Therefore, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any development milestone payments may be payable to us. As such, the development milestone payments associated with the KKC Agreement involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received. Sales-based milestones and royalties will be recognized as royalty revenue in the period the related sale occurred.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and vendor agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites in connection with clinical studies and to vendors related to product manufacturing and development of clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors out of our control, such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not experienced any significant adjustments to our estimates.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2020.
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
License Fees
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized license fees of $1.5 million, derived from the KKC license agreement.
Research and Development
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total research and development expenses increased by $7.4 million, or 17%, to $50.4 million from $43.0 million for the prior year due to increases in clinical trial activities expenses of $5.9 million, professional expenses of $1.4 million, and employee related expenses of $0.1 million. The increase in clinical activities expenses was due to increased study activities related to SNDX-5613 of $5.3 million, increased study activity related to axatilimab of $3.7 million, and in SNDX-5613 CMC activities of $3.7 million. In
2020, we also recognized a $2.0 million expense upon the achievement of a certain milestone in connection with the axatilimab program. These increases were partially offset by the $4.0 million expense for achievement of certain milestones in connection with the menin program in 2019, reduced activities associated with our entinostat programs of $3.8 million, and decreased axatilimab CMC activities of $1.0 million. The increase in professional fees is primarily due to increased clinical consulting of $0.5 million, increased medical affairs activities of $0.5 million, increase in biostatistic activities of $0.2 million, and quality assurance consulting of $0.2 million.
We expect research and development expenses to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of clinical trial activities, clinical manufacturing and other development activities.
Research and development expenses consisted of the following:
General and Administrative
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total general and administrative expenses increased by $6.4 million, or 40%, to $22.5 million, from $16.1 million for the prior year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased employee related expenses of $3.7 million and increased professional fees of $2.7 million. The increase in employee related expenses is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of $2.7 million and $1.2 million for salary and benefits due to increased headcount, partially offset by reduced travel of $0.2 million. The increased stock compensation expense includes $1.0 million related to the modification of option agreements in connection with the retirement of a certain employee. The increase in professional fees was primarily due to increased pre-commercialization activities of $1.3 million in anticipation of our entinostat readout, increased director’s’ and officers’ insurance of $0.9 million, increased legal fees of $0.4 and audit fees of $0.1 million.
Interest Income
For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income, decreased $0.7 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a lower average cash and investment balance and lower interest rates on our investments.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our term loan, operational and capital leases. The increase is primarily due to our term loan.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $293.1 million. Since our inception, our operations have been primarily financed by net proceeds from our IPO, our follow-on stock offerings, our term loan, sale of convertible preferred stock and convertible debt securities and proceeds from our license agreements. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2020, will fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. In addition to our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, we are eligible to receive research and development funding and to earn milestone and other contingent payments for the achievement of defined collaboration objectives and certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalty payments under our collaboration agreements. Our ability to earn these milestone and contingent payments and the timing of achieving these milestones is primarily dependent upon the outcome of our collaborators’ research and development activities and is uncertain at this time.
In December 2020, we sold 6,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $23.00 for net proceeds of approximately $135.0 million.
In May 2020, we sold 6,388,889 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $18.00 for net proceeds of approximately $107.9 million.
In January 2020, we sold 3,036,719 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $8.00 and pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,338,287 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $35.0 million. Upon the completion of the 2020 offering, we had 5,838,287 pre-funded warrant shares outstanding. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable into shares of common stock for $0.0001 per share. The shares of common stock into which the warrants may be exercised are considered outstanding for the purposes of computing earnings per share.
In March 2019, we issued to certain investors an aggregate of 2,095,039 shares of our common stock and 2,500,000 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, at a price of $6.00 per share of common stock and $5.9999 for each pre-funded warrant. We sold the shares of common stock and prefunded warrants together with two series of warrants, Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 4,595,039 shares of our common stock. The pre-funded warrants enable the holder to make a cash investment in our common stock without increasing their beneficial ownership in our common stock because the shares of common stock underlying the pre-funded warrant are not issued or issuable until the warrant is actually exercised or becomes exercisable without exceeding the ownership limitations set forth in the pre-funded warrant. Each Series 1 warrant has an initial exercise price of $12.00 per share of common stock and each Series 2 warrant has an initial exercise price of $18.00 per share of common stock, in each case subject to certain adjustments. The Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants contain a one-time exercise price adjustment. If we sell shares or share equivalents at less than $12.00 per share at a time when our Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants are outstanding, then an exercise price for those warrants would be adjusted downward, which will result in us receiving less proceeds than we otherwise would and could result in further dilution to our stockholders if such warrants were then exercised. As a result of the January 2020 offering, the initial exercise price of the Series 1 warrants was reduced to $10.00 per share and the initial exercise price of the Series 2 warrants was reduced to $13.00 per share. In May 2020, holders of 3,489,131 Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants received 1,512,229 shares of common stock in a cashless exercise. In August 2020, a holder of 416,666 Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants received 130,151 shares of common stock in a cashless exercise. In November 2020, a holder of 228,373 Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants received 100,035 shares of common stock in a cashless exercise and in December 2020, holders of 460,869 Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants received 253,526 shares of common stock in a cashless exercise. As of December 31, 2020 all Series 1 warrants and Series 2 warrants have been exercised.
Loan and Security Agreement
On February 7, 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, which provides for aggregate maximum borrowings of up to $30.0 million, consisting of (i) a term loan of up to $20.0 million, which was funded on February 7, 2020, and (ii) subject to Hercules’ investment committee approval, an additional term loan of up to $10.0 million, available for borrowing from February 7, 2020 to December 15, 2020, which we refer to as the Tranche 2 Advance. We did not request the available additional borrowing by the due date. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 9.85% or (ii) 5.10% plus the Wall Street Journal prime rate.
Borrowings under the Loan Agreement are repayable in monthly interest-only payments through October 1, 2021. After the interest-only payment period, borrowings under the Loan Agreement are repayable in equal monthly payments of principal and accrued interest until the maturity date of the loan, which is September 1, 2023, or the Maturity Date. At our option, we may prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding borrowings, subject to a prepayment premium equal to (i) 2.0% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the first year following the applicable loan being funded, (ii) 1.5% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the second year following the applicable loan being funded, and (iii) 1.0% of the principal amount outstanding at any time thereafter but prior to the Maturity Date. In addition, we paid a $100,000 facility charge upon closing and will pay a $50,000 facility charge in connection with the Tranche 2 Advance. The Loan Agreement also provides for a final payment, payable upon maturity or the repayment in full of all obligations under the agreement, of up to $998,000.
Borrowings under the Loan Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries personal property and other assets, other than our intellectual property. The Loan Agreement includes a minimum cash covenant of $12.5 million that has applied commencing on September 30, 2020, subject to reduction upon satisfaction of certain conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement were met. The cash covenant of $12.5 million was waived. In addition, the Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a covenant against the occurrence of a “change in control,” financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, investments, distributions, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a “material adverse effect” as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to third-party indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
At-the-Market Offering Program
In April 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with Cowen, under which we had the ability issue and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million from time to time, or the 2017 ATM Program. Shares sold pursuant to the sales agreement were sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-217172), which was declared effective on April 20, 2017. The proceeds from the offerings, if any, were used for general corporate purposes, including expenditures for research and development of our drug products. In 2019, prior to the effectiveness of the 2019 ATM Program, we sold 140,819 shares of common stock, with net proceeds of $0.9 million.
In August 2019, we entered into a new sales agreement with Cowen under which we had the ability to issue and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million from time to time pursuant to the ATM program, or the 2019 ATM Program. Cowen was not required to sell any specific amount but acted as our sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices. This agreement replaced the sales agreement signed in April 2017. Shares sold pursuant to the sales agreement were to be sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-233564), which was declared effective on September 10, 2019. Our common stock would be sold at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale; and as a result, prices may vary. We agreed to pay Cowen up to 3% of the gross proceeds from any common stock sold through the sales agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the 2019 ATM Program was cancelled in connection with the public offering in December 2020.
Future Funding Requirements
Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research and development services, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.
Additionally, the process of testing drug candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. We cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of our product candidates;
•
the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more trials than we currently expect;
•
the cost to establish, maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•
market acceptance of our product candidates;
•
the cost and timing of selecting, auditing and developing manufacturing capabilities, and potentially validating manufacturing sites for commercial-scale manufacturing;
•
the cost and timing for obtaining pricing and reimbursement, which may require additional trials to address pharmacoeconomic benefit;
•
the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates if any product candidate receives regulatory approval and we determine to commercialize it ourselves;
•
the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;
•
the diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;
•
the interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel, quarantines or social distancing protocols imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the cost of disruption to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our products, whichwould adversely impact our ability to continue our clinical trial operations;
•
the effect of competing technological and market developments; and
•
our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems, as we grow our company..
We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any product revenues from product sales to date. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and additional funding from license and collaboration arrangements. Except for any obligations of our collaborators to reimburse us for research and development expenses or to make milestone or royalty payments under our agreements with them, we will not have any committed external source of liquidity.
We have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $568.6 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through a combination of the sale of equity, debt financings, or other sources, including potential collaborations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $28.6 million and was primarily due to the $27.4 million of proceeds from a direct placement offering, the $0.8 million of proceeds from the 2017 ATM Program, and the $0.4 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and ESPP purchases.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
(1)
Amounts include the estimated interest under our Term loan based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020.
(2)
In September 2016, we entered into a new five-year operating lease for office space in Waltham, Massachusetts, with a lease commencement date of March 1, 2017. In December 2015, we entered into a 62-month building lease for office space in New York, New York, which commenced on January 1, 2016. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes. In February 2021, we extended the lease for a period of 18 months at $15,000 per month.
(3)
In February 2016, we entered into a five-year non-cancelable operating lease for office equipment. In January 2021, we extended the lease by 12 months.
(4)
In April 2018, we entered into a four-year non-cancelable lease for office equipment, which is accounted for as a capital lease. The leased asset is included in property, plant and equipment, at cost.
The contractual obligations table does not include any potential contingent payments upon the achievement by us of clinical, regulatory and commercial events, as applicable, or royalty payments we may be required to make under license or collaboration agreements we have entered into with various entities pursuant to which we have in-licensed certain intellectual property. See “Business-Collaborations,” “Business-License Agreements” and “Business-In-Licensed Intellectual Property” for additional information. The table also excludes potential payments we may be required to make under manufacturing agreements as the timing of when these payments will actually be made is uncertain and the payments are contingent upon the initiation and completion of future activities.
We also have employment agreements with executive officers and certain other key employees that would require us to make severance payments to them if we terminate their employment without cause or the they resign for good cause. The payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, and the amounts payable under these provisions depend upon the level of compensation at the time of termination of employment, are therefore not calculable at this time, and, as a result, we have not included any such amounts in the above table.
Net Operating Loss and Research and Development Tax Credit Carryforwards
At December 31, 2020, we had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $96.1 million and $41.0 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire at various dates starting in 2025. Any federal net operating loss incurred in 2018 and in future years may now be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. At December 31, 2020, we had available income tax credits of approximately $5.3 million, with $3.3 million attributable to Federal R&D Credits and $2.0 million attributable to state R&D Credits, which are available to reduce future income taxes, if any. These income tax credits begin to expire in 2021.
Utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before we can use them. We have recorded a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets, including our deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:
•
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
•
no non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
•
exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not included all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues as of the end of any fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.
