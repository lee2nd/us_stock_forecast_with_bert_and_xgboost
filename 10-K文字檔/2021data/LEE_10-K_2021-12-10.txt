ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations and financial condition as of September 26, 2021 and for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, included herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We use non-GAAP financial performance measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the relevant GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a GAAP basis.
In this report, we present Adjusted EBITDA, cash costs and margin, which are non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of certain items consisting primarily of restructuring charges and non-cash charges. We believe such expenses, charges, and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations, and their inclusion in results makes for more difficult comparisons between years and with peer group companies. In the future, however, we are likely to incur expenses, charges, and gains similar to the items for which the applicable GAAP financial measures have been adjusted and to report non-GAAP financial measures excluding such items. Accordingly, exclusion of those or similar items in our non-GAAP presentations should not be interpreted as implying the items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual.
We define our non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, as follows:
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that enhances financial statement users overall understanding of the operating performance of the Company. The measure isolates unusual, infrequent or non-cash transactions from the operating performance of the business. This allows users to easily compare operating performance among various fiscal periods and how management measures the performance of the business. This measure also provides users with a benchmark that can be used when forecasting future operating performance of the Company that excludes unusual, nonrecurring or one time transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of the calculation used by stockholders and analysts to determine the value of our business when using the market approach, which applies a market multiple to financial metrics. It is also a measure used to calculate the leverage ratio of the Company, which is a key financial ratio monitored and used by the Company and its investors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus non-operating expenses, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, restructuring costs and other, stock compensation and our 50% share of EBITDA from TNI and MNI, minus equity in earnings of TNI and MNI and curtailment gains.
Cash Costs represent a non-GAAP financial performance measure of operating expenses which are measured on an accrual basis and settled in cash. This measure is useful to investors in understanding the components of the Company’s cash-settled operating costs. Cash Costs can be used by financial statement users to assess the Company's ability to manage and control its operating structure. Cash Costs are defined as compensation, newsprint and ink and other operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, other non-cash operating expenses and other non-operating expenses are excluded. Cash Costs also exclude restructuring costs and other, which are typically settled in cash.
Total Operating Revenue Less Cash Costs, or “margin”, represents a non-GAAP financial performance measure of revenue less total cash costs, also a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful to investors in understanding the profitability of the Company after direct cash costs related to the production and delivery of products are paid. Margin is also useful in developing opinions and expectations about the Company’s ability to manage and control its operating cost structure in relation to its peers.
A table reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable measure under GAAP, is set forth below under the caption "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".
The subtotals of operating expenses representing cash costs and total operating revenue less cash costs can be found in tables in Item 7, included herein, under the caption “Continuing Operations”.
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(UNAUDITED)
The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial performance measure of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure:
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most subjective and complex judgments.
Intangible Assets, Other Than Goodwill
Local mastheads (e.g., publishing periodical titles and web site domain names) are not subject to amortization. Non-amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest the asset might be impaired.
The quantitative impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of each masthead or domain name with its carrying amount. We use a relief from royalty approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each masthead, domain name, or trade name. Management's judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the intangibles fair values are consistently applied to each underlying business in determining the fair value of each intangible asset. In 2021 and 2020, we recognized impairment charges of $787,000 and $972,000, respectively. No impairment was recorded in 2019. Of our various mastheads, several have fair values that have headroom under 20% over their carrying value and could experience impairment in the future if we do not achieve our revenue projections.
Our amortizable intangible assets consist mainly of customer relationships including subscriber lists and advertiser relationships. These asset values are amortized systematically over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group. In 2021, we recognized $190,000 of impairment on intangible assets subject to amortization. There were no indicators of impairment on intangible assets subject to amortization in 2020 or 2019.
Our quantitative impairment analysis includes several inputs that are considered estimates, these include royalty rates, discount rates, five-year revenue forecast, and long term growth rates. All of these estimates are subject to uncertainty as future results may or may not be achieved. The Company royalty rates utilized range from 1.0% to 1.5%, a 50 basis point decrease in royalty rates would result in an additional $9,816,000 of impairment. The Company’s discount rate utilized in the analysis has ranged from 9.50% to 11.50% in different years depending on market conditions. Increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points would result in an additional $1,075,000 of impairment. The Company has had various revenue forecast utilized in the analysis over different years. A one percent decrease in forecasted revenues would result in an additional $674,000 of impairment. Decreasing long term growth rates by 100 basis points results in an additional $26,000 of impairment.
Future decreases in our market value, or significant differences in revenue, expenses or cash flows from estimates used to determine fair value, could result in additional impairment charges in the future.
Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We, along with our subsidiaries, have various defined benefit retirement plans, postretirement plans and postemployment plans, under which substantially all of the benefits have been frozen in previous years.
We account for our pension, postretirement and postemployment plans in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, which requires us to include the funded status of our pension plans in our balance sheets and to recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), the gains or losses that arise during the period but are not recognized in pension expense. The service cost component of net period benefit cost is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and included in Compensation while all other components are included in other non-operating income/expense.
The determination of pension and postretirement plan obligations and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the discount rates applied to pension and postretirement plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
The discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year-end on corporate bonds rated AA and above with a maturity to match the expected benefit payment stream. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets, input from the actuaries and investment consultants and long- term inflation assumptions. We used an assumption of 5.9% for 2021 for our expected return on pension plan assets and a 4.0% assumption for 2021 for our postretirement and postemployment benefits.
A 50 basis point change in discount rates would result in an increase to pension and postretirement and postemployment benefits liabilities of $25,400,000. A 50 basis point change in expected rate of return of assets results would result in an increase to pension and postretirement and postemployment benefits expense of $1,809,000.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and record our tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in our reported results of operations. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, if any.
Our current and deferred income tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. These estimates are reviewed and adjusted, if needed, throughout the year. Adjustments between our estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Business Combinations
Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. The Company prepares its initial estimates of the fair values of intangible assets utilizing the multi-period excess earnings method for customer-related intangible assets and the relief from royalty method for indefinite lived masthead assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:
•
future expected cash flows from subscription, advertising and commercial print relationships and related assumptions about future revenue growth and customer retention;
•
discount rates; and
•
royalty rates used to value acquired mastheads.
Additional information regarding our accounting for business combinations can be found in Note 1.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a wider array of reasonable and supportable information to inform and develop credit loss estimates. We are required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for both accounts receivable and other financial instruments. The new standard was adopted beginning September 28, 2020 using a modified retrospective approach. This change did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
CERTAIN MATTERS AFFECTING CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS
The following items affect period-over-period comparisons from 2021 to 2019 and will continue to affect period-over-period comparisons for future results.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
•
In March 2020, we completed the acquisition of BH Media and Buffalo News for a purchase price of $140,000,000. The acquisition was funded by a 25-year term loan with BH Finance, in an aggregate principal amount of $576,000,000 at a 9% annual rate (referred to herein as "Credit Agreement" and "Term Loan"), as part of a broader comprehensive refinancing of all of our then outstanding debt.
•
In the 13 weeks ended March 2020, we disposed of substantially all of the assets of certain of our smaller properties, including four daily newspapers and related print and digital publications, for an aggregate sales price of $3,950,000.
Impacts of COVID-19
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related measures to contain its spread have resulted in significant volatility and economic uncertainty, which is expected to continue in the near term. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and the Company currently expects that it will continue to have a significant negative impact on the Company's business and operating results in the near term. While vaccines have become widely available in the United States, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and unpredictable as it will depend on the pace of vaccine distribution, government responses to future outbreaks, the spread of variants, as well as changes in consumer behavior, all of which are highly uncertain. Despite the significant impacts on our operating results, we have operated uninterrupted in providing local news, information and advertising in our print and digital editions.
In combination with our acquisition integration, ongoing business transformation and addressing the continued effects of COVID-19 on our operating results, we continued to implement measures to solidify our relationship with our local advertisers, reduce our cost structure and preserve liquidity, and as a result expected to achieve $100 million in cost reductions from December 2019 through September 2021. Since the closing of the Transactions, we have realized $112 million in cost synergies, well ahead of our target set last year of $100 million.
OPERATIONS
Operating results, as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, are summarized below:
We acquired or disposed of certain properties in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, see Note 1.

Total operating revenue was $618,004,000 in 2020, up $108,150,000, or 21.2%, compared to 2019. Total operating revenue increased primarily due to acquired revenue of $203,039,000.
Advertising and marketing services revenue was $289,655,000 in 2020, up 8.9% compared to the prior year, including $82,246,000 from acquired Advertising and marketing services revenue. Local and national retail advertising revenue was $211,701,000, up $6,677,000 from 2019. The increase is due to $56,863,000 of acquired local and national revenue. Classifieds revenue was $75,754,000, up $14,845,000 from 2019. The increase is due to acquired classified revenue of $25,267,000. Digital advertising and marketing services totaled $106,491,000 in 2020 and represented 36.8% of 2020 total advertising and marketing services revenue, partially offsetting print declines. The increase in all categories of advertising were partially offset by continued downward trend in print advertising demand and the impacts of COVID-19.
Subscription revenue totaled $268,285,000 in 2020, or up 43.1%. The increase is due to acquired revenue of $106,491,000, offset by lower paid print circulation units, consistent with industry trends and timing of price increases. As of September 2020, we had 244,000 digital-only subscribers, in which 92,000 were acquired as part of the Transactions.
Other revenue, which primarily consist of digital services from TownNews, commercial printing revenue and until March 16, 2020, revenue from the Management Agreement, totaled $60,064,000, a 6.3% increase compared to 2019.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Operating Expense Comparison 2021-2020
Total operating expenses were $744,505,000, a 30.4% increase compared to 2020. Total operating expenses from the Transactions totaled $347,823,000 and $193,805,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash Costs were $686,268,000, a 30.3% increase compared to 2020. Cash Costs from the Transactions totaled $353,794,000 and $176,763,000, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash Costs on a pro forma basis were down 2.7% compared to 2020.
Compensation expense increased $87,873,000 in 2021, or a 36.2% increase compared to 2020. Compensation expense from the Transactions totaled $165,391,000 and $86,121,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Compensation was up 0.1% on a pro forma basis. The modest increase was due to a one time furlough and compensation reductions for all employees in 2020 in response to COVID-19 of approximately $10 million and investments in digital talent made throughout 2021 and the lack of incentive compensation in 2020. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in FTEs due to business transformation initiatives.
Newsprint and ink costs increased $5,532,000 in 2021, or a 22.8% increase compared to 2020. Newsprint and ink costs from the Transactions totaled $19,730,000 and $10,643,000, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a pro forma basis newsprint and ink expense decreased 19.8%. This decrease was attributable to declines in newsprint volume and outsourcing of our printing. See Item 7A, “Commodities”, included herein, for further discussion and analysis of the impact of newsprint on our business.
Other operating expenses increased $66,215,000 in 2021, or a 25.5% increase compared to 2020. Other operating expenses include all operating costs not considered to be compensation, newsprint and ink, depreciation and amortization, or restructuring costs and other. The largest components are costs associated with printing and distribution of our printed products, digital cost of goods sold and facility expenses. Other operating expenses from the Transactions totaled $188,286,000 and $79,948,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a pro forma basis, other operating expenses were down 3.5%. The decrease is attributable to lower delivery and other print-related costs due to lower volumes of our print editions, partially offset by increases in investments to fund our digital growth strategy.
Restructuring costs and other totaled $7,182,000 and $13,751,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2020, restructuring costs and other include an estimate of costs related to withdrawals from certain of our multiemployer pension plans totaling $4,400,000. The remaining restructuring costs in 2021 and 2020 are predominately severance.
Depreciation expense increased $2,597,000, or 16.9%, in 2021. Amortization expense increased $4,111,000, or 19.8%, in 2021. Increases in both are due to the acquired assets from the Transactions.
Assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other was a net expense of $8,214,000 in 2021 compared to a net gain of $5,403,000 in 2020. Impairment in 2021 and 2020 totaled $977,000 and $972,000, respectively. Assets losses and gains are part the Company's ongoing real estate and non-core asset monetization.
Operating Expense Comparison 2020-2019
Total operating expenses were $571,129,000, a 29.1% increase compared to 2019, which included $193,805,000 in operating expenses from the Transactions. Cash Costs were $526,647,000, a 32.1% increase compared to 2019, which included $176,763,000 of acquired Cash Costs.
Compensation expense increased $60,154,000 in 2020, or a 32.9% increase compared to 2019. This increase was attributable to $86,121,000 of acquired compensation expense, partially offset by expense and FTE reductions tied to business transformation initiatives. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we issued furloughs or compensation reductions for all employees resulting in a temporary $10,000,000 reduction in operating expenses.
Newsprint and ink costs increased $2,006,000 in 2020, or a 9% increase compared to 2019. This increase is attributable to acquired newsprint and ink expenses of $10,643,000, offset by declines in newsprint volume and prices and outsourcing of our printing. See Item 7A, "Commodities", included herein, for further discussion and analysis of the impact of newsprint on our business.
Other operating expenses increased $65,673,000 in 2020, or a 33.9% increase compared to 2019. Other operating expenses include all operating costs not considered to be compensation, newsprint and ink, depreciation and amortization, or restructuring costs and other. The largest components are costs associated with printing and distribution of our printed products, digital cost of goods sold and facility expenses. The increase is attributable to $79,948,000 of acquired other operating and increases in digital investments, partially offset by lower delivery and other print-related costs due to lower volumes of our print editions.
Restructuring costs and other totaled $13,751,000 and $11,635,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020 and 2019, restructuring costs and other include an estimate of costs related to withdrawals from certain multiemployer plans totaling $4,400,000 and $3,836,000. The remaining restructuring costs in 2020 and 2019 are predominately severance.
Depreciation expense increased $2,890,000, or 23.1% in 2020. Amortization expense increased $3,911,000, or 23.2%, in 2020. Both increased due to the Transactions.
Assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other was a net gain of $5,403,000 in 2020 compared to net expense of $2,464,000 in 2019.
Equity In Equity Investments
Equity in earnings of TNI and MNI increased $ 3,009,000 in 2021, or 88.4%, compared to 2020. Equity in earnings of TNI and MNI decreased $3,718,000 in 2020.
NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES
Non-operating Income and Expense Comparison 2021-2020
Interest expense decreased $2,970,000, or 6.2%, to $44,773,000 in 2021 due to lower debt balances. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding amortization of debt financing cost, was 9.0% in 2021 and 2020. We recognized no debt financing and administrative costs in 2021 compared to $11,966,000 in 2020. Expenses in the prior year are due to writing off unamortized financing costs paid in conjunction with a prior refinancing.
Included in other non-operating income and expense is income related to our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, which totaled $33,269,000 and $3,830,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognized a non-cash curtailment gain of $23,830,000 and a reduction in our benefit obligation in 2021 by eliminating post-retirement medical coverage for certain employees. We recognized pension withdrawal costs in 2021 of $12,862,000 in connection with the withdrawal from pension plans that covered certain employees. The withdrawal liabilities will be paid over the next 20 years.
As more fully discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, we recorded a liability for the Warrants, issued in connection with the Warrant Agreement. We re-measure the liability to fair value each reporting period, with changes reported in other non-operating income (expenses). Due to the fluctuation in the price of our Common Stock and changes in interest rates, the estimated fair value of the warrant liability can change each period. We recorded non-operating income of $292,000 and $832,000 in 2021 and 2020 respectively, due to the change in fair value of the Warrants.
Non-operating Income and Expense Comparison 2020-2019
Interest expense increased $255,000, or 0.5%, to $47,743,000 in 2020 due to additional debt related to the 2020 acquisition. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding amortization of debt financing cost, was 9% in 2020 and 10% in 2019.
We recognized $11,966,000 of debt financing and administrative costs in 2020 compared to $7,214,000 in 2019. The majority of costs represent accelerated amortization of refinancing costs paid as part of the 2014 Refinancing.
Included in other non-operating income and expense is income related to our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, which totaled $3,830,000 and $2,847,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Other non-operating income/expense also includes a $7,600,000 realized gain on the sale of a private equity investment and a fair value adjustment related to the Warrants. As more fully discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, we recorded a liability for the Warrants, issued in connection with the Warrant Agreement. We re-measure the liability to fair value each reporting period, with changes reported in other non-operating income (expense). Due to the fluctuation in the price of our Common Stock and changes in interest rates, the estimated fair value of the warrant liability can change each period. We recorded non-operating income of $832,000 and $612,000 in 2020 and 2019 respectively, due to the change in fair value of the Warrants.
INCOME TAX EXPENSES
In 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $7,215,000, or 22.5% of pretax income and in 2020, we recorded an income tax expense of $4,104,000, or 144.3% of pretax income. In 2019, we recorded an income tax expense of $7,931,000, or 33.3% of pre-tax income. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for a discussion of the difference between the expected federal income tax rate and the actual tax rates.
NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net income was $24,832,000 in 2021 compared to net loss of $1,261,000 in 2020. The increase in net income is predominately due to the curtailment gain and an increase in operating income, offset by the withdrawal liabilities discussed above. In 2019, net income was $15,909,000.
Diluted earnings per share was $3.91 per share in 2021 compared to diluted losses per share of $0.55 per share in 2020. In 2019, diluted earnings per share were $2.51 per share.
Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, see Note 1
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow are expected to provide sufficient liquidity, together with cash on hand, to meet our requirements, primarily operating expenses, interest expense and capital expenditures. A summary of our cash flows is included in the narrative below.
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $50,078,000 in 2021 compared to $49,869,000 in 2020, an increase of $209,000. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in operating results of $48,590,000 (defined as net income (loss) adjusted for non-working capital items) offset by a decrease in cash from working capital of $48,381,000, primarily related to unfavorable changes in accounts receivable and income taxes payable, partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and pension and postretirement obligations.
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $49,869,000 in 2020 compared to $57,676,000 in 2020 a decrease of $7,807,000. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in operating results of $32,101,000 offset by an increase in cash from working capital of $24,294,000, primarily related to favorable changes in accounts receivable and income taxes payable, partially offset by unfavorable changes in pension and postretirement obligations and accounts payable.
Investing Activities
Cash required for investing activities totaled $2,278,000 in 2021 and $118,176,000 in 2020. 2020 included $130,985,000 in spending related to the Transactions. Capital spending totaled $7,479,000 and $8,096,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Proceeds from sales of assets totaled $4,596,000 and $21,710,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Cash required for investing activities totaled $118,176,000 in 2020 and $10,933,000 in 2019. Capital spending totaled $8,096,000 and $5,901,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Proceeds from sales of assets totaled $21,710,000 in 2020 and $1,501,000 in 2019, respectively.
We anticipate that funds necessary for capital expenditures, which are expected to be $12,000,000 in 2022, and other requirements, will be available from internally generated funds.
Financing Activities
Cash required for financing activities totaled $55,421,000 in 2021 and $43,478,000 in 2019, while cash provided by financing activities totaled $93,395,000 in 2020. Debt reduction accounted for the majority of the usage of funds in 2021 and 2019, while proceeds from the Transactions accounted for the funds provided in the 2020 period.
Excluding payments required from the Company's future excess cash flow (as defined in Note 6), the only required principal payments include payments from net cash proceeds from asset sales (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and payments upon certain instances of change in control. Current maturities of long-term debt are from excess cash flows. There are no other scheduled mandatory principal payments required under the Credit Agreement.
Liquidity
Our liquidity, consisting of cash on the balance sheet, totals $26,112,000 at September 26, 2021. This liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows from operations. Including current maturities of long-term debt of $6,112,000, our liquidity is $20,000,000. We expect all interest and principal payments due in the next twelve months will be satisfied by existing cash and our cash flows, which will allow us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.
The Warrants, as defined in Note 6, if and when exercised, would provide additional liquidity in an amount up to $25,140,000, which is not considered in the calculation of Excess Cash Flow.
At September 26, 2021, the principal amount of our outstanding debt totals $482,616,000. For the last twelve months ending September 26, 2021, the principal amount of our debt, net of cash, is 3.9 times our Adjusted EBITDA.
The 2020 Refinancing as defined in Note 6, significantly extended our debt maturity profile with final maturity of our debt in 2045.
In February 2020 our filing of a replacement Form S-3 registration statement ("Shelf") with the SEC was declared effective and expires February 2023. The Shelf registration gives us the flexibility to issue and publicly distribute various types of securities, including preferred stock, common stock, warrants, secured or unsecured debt securities, purchase contracts and units consisting of any combination of such securities, from time to time, in one or more offerings, up to an aggregate amount of $750,000,000. SEC issuer eligibility rules require us to have a public float of at least $75,000,000 in order to use the Shelf.
Other Matters
None
SEASONALITY
Our largest source of publishing revenue, retail advertising, is seasonal and tends to fluctuate with retail sales in markets served. Historically, retail advertising is higher in the December and June quarters. Advertising and marketing services revenue is lowest in the March quarter.
INFLATION
Price increases (or decreases) for our products are implemented when deemed appropriate by us. We continuously evaluate price increases, productivity improvements, sourcing efficiencies and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of inflation.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at September 26, 2021:
(1)
Maturities of long-term debt are limited to mandatory payments. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.
(2)
Interest expense includes an estimate of interest expense for the Term Note, until its maturity in March 2045. Interest expense under the Term Note is estimated using the 9.0% contractual rate applied to the outstanding balance as reduced by future contractual maturities of such debt. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.
The table above excludes future cash requirements for pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations. The periods in which these obligations will be settled in cash are not readily determinable and are subject to numerous future events and assumptions. See Notes 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.
The contractual obligations above exclude unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. We are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities for such matters. A substantial amount of our deferred income tax liabilities will not result in future cash payments. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.
