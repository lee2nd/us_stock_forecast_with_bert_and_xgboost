Store Acquisitions and New Store Openings
Core to our growth strategy is to expand the number of our retail garden centers throughout North America. The hydroponic retail landscape is fragmented, which allows us to acquire the “best of breed” hydroponic operations. In addition to the 12 states we are currently operating, we have identified new market opportunities in states that include Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Mississippi and Missouri. In 2020, we opened a second hydroponic/gardening center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a 40,000 square feet store operation and fulfillment center, and completed eight (8) acquisitions, adding 14 locations in 2020. To-date, the Company has acquired 14 new locations in the first quarter of 2021 and has an active target pipeline of acquisitions for the remainder of the year.
Commercial Sales Division
Our commercial division is focused on selling end-to-end solutions for large commercial cultivators. When a commercial customer gains a new cultivation license, they will need to purchase lighting, benching, environmental control systems, irrigation, fertigation and other products to outfit their cultivation facility. Commercial customers typically purchase larger amounts and sizes of products. We offer commercial customers volume pricing, terms and financing. Our commercial team manages thousands of commercial accounts across North America. Our commercial division collectively contributed approximately $49 million in revenue for 2020 compared to approximately $17 million for 2019, a 189% year over year increase. We have identified over 15,000 active licensed growers in North America and believe there is significant room for us to expand our base of commercial customers.
E-Commerce/Omni Channel Division
Our digital strategy is focused on capturing the home, craft and commercial growers online. GrowGeneration.com offers over 10,000 hydroponic products all curated by our product team. GrowGeneration.com offer customers the option to have their orders shipped directly to their locations, anywhere in North America or alternatively customers can buy online and pick up in store.

Agron.io offers commercial pricing, real-time inventory, and the largest product catalog in the industry, with over 10,000 products in over 60 categories, including greenhouses, extraction, hemp, and commercial equipment.

CONDENSED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue
Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $193.4 million, compared to approximately $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $113.6 million, or 142.5%. The increase in revenues is due to 1) the addition of 14 new retail stores opened or acquired during 2020 for which revenues were $31 million, 2) 11 stores opened or acquired at various times during 2019 that were open for all of 2020 which had an increase in revenues of $51 million, 3) same store sales which increase 63% comparing 2020 to 2019, which had an increase in revenues of approximately $28 million, 4) an increase in our ecommerce sales of $5.9 million from 2019 to 2020 and 5) revenues of $300,000 from Canopy Crop Management Corp/Power SI, acquired in later December 2020.
While the Company continues to focus on the 11 geographic markets noted below and the growth opportunities that exist in each market, we also are focusing on new store acquisitions, proprietary products, private label products, and developing our online revenues with GrowGeneration.com and Amazon revenues.
Overall revenues in the Colorado market increased approximately $4.2 million or 27%, as noted above, comparing the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenues was due to our continued focus on selling efforts in building growth in this market primarily the commercial market.
Our revenues in the California market have seen growth of approximately $11.4 million or 74% and the increase was primarily from 1) the addition of 8 new stores through acquisitions during 2020 that contributed $5 million in revenues, 2) 3 stores that comprise same store sales that had an increase in revenues of $4.4 million and 3) 1 store acquired in 2019 that had an increase in revenues of $2 million. The California market is the largest market in the US and is a continuous focus of the Company relative to its growth strategy.
Revenues in the Rhode Island market increased approximately $12.6 million or 150%. The primary reason for the increase in revenues in the Rhode Island market was primarily due to an increase in commercial sales with new regional and multi-state commercial customers.
Revenues in the Michigan market increased approximately $22.6 million or 244%. The increase was primarily from 1) increase in same store sales of $4.6 million, 2) two new stores acquired in 2020, that had revenues of $1.9 million, 3) one acquisition in the third quarter of 2019 that resulted in an increase in revenues of $9.7 million and 4) an acquisition of a new store in Lansing in 2020 that was consolidated with an existing store in Lansing that had an increase in revenues of $6.4 million.
Revenues in the Maine market increased approximately $8.9 million or 144%. Maine was a new market in 2019 as a result of a new store opening in February 2019 and the acquisition of two stores in May 2019. 2020 represented a full year of revenues for the three stores.

The ecommerce revenues generated for GrowGeneration.com had an increase in revenue in 2020 of approximately $5.9 million or 123% from $4.8 million in 2019 to $10.6 million in 2020. The ecommerce growth is a result of marketing driving a significant number of new customers to the website.
Same Store Sales
The Company had the same 13 stores (4 in Colorado, 3 in California, 2 in Michigan, 1 in Washington, 1 in Oklahoma, 1 in Rhode Island and 1 in Nevada) opened for the entire year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. These same stores generated $72.3 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $44.3 million in revenues for 2019, an increase of 63%. The increase in revenues in these 13 same store sales was primarily an increase in commercial sales and from an increase in walk in traffic.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased approximately $84.6 million or 146.5%, to approximately $142.3 million, compared to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of goods sold was directly attributable to the 142.5% increase in revenues, as detailed above, comparing the year ended December 31, 2020 to 2019.
Gross profit was $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $29 million or 132%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 26.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the gross profit margin percentage in 2020 was due to a greater percentage of commercial and ecommerce revenues as a percent of total revenue both of which have lower margins than in retail sales. Commercial and ecommerce represented 31% of all revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 28% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are comprised of store operations, primarily payroll, rent and utilities, and corporate overhead. Store operating costs were approximately $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and approximately $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $8.6 million or 85%. The increase in store operating costs was directly attributable to 1) the addition of 14 new retail stores opened or acquired during 2020 and 2) 11 stores opened or acquired at various times during 2019 that were open for all of 2020. The addition of these stores, as discussed above, were the primary reasons for the increase in store operating costs. Store operating costs as a percentage of revenues were 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 24% reduction. Store operating costs were positively impacted by 1) the opening of new and acquired stores throughout 2020 which have lower percentage of operating costs to revenues due to their larger size and higher volume and 2) same store revenues increased 63% comparing the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019, which also contributed significantly to lowering of the store operating costs as a percentage of revenues since the majority of store operating costs are fixed.
Corporate overhead, comprised of general and administrative costs, share based compensation, depreciation and amortization and corporate salaries, was approximately $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Corporate overhead was 12.4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 13% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Corporate overhead, excluding non-cash share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, was 7.0% of revenues compared to 8.5% of revenues for 2019 shows that non-cash expenses was a larger component of overhead cost in 2020 compared to 2019. Non-cash costs included in corporate overhead was 5.3% of revenues for 2020 compared to 4.4% of revenues for 2019. The increase in non-cash expenses in corporate overhead as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to 1) the increase in non-cash share-based compensation from approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.4 million and 2) the increase in depreciation and amortization from approximately $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in non-cash share-based compensation was primarily the result of several new executive employment agreements which became effective January 1, 2020, which resulted in the vesting of common stock and common stock options at the start of the first quarter, as well as options issued in 2018 and 2019 for options vesting in 2020. The share-based awards associated with the new executive employment agreements resulted in approximately one-third of the award being recognized as an expense in the first three months of 2020, due to vesting, and the remaining two-thirds on the share-based awards are being recognized over a 24-month period commencing January 2020 and ending December 2021, based on shared based award vesting in future periods. The vesting of these shares and options was significantly higher in 2020 than they will be in the periods subsequent to 2020. The increase in depreciation and amortization is due to the significant increase in both depreciable assets and acquired intangible assets being amortized over their useful lives. Salaries as a percentage of revenues were 4.4% for 2020 and 4.5% for 2019. The increase in salaries expense from 2019 to 2020, which increased $5.0 million, from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to the increase in corporate staff to support expanding store operations, including management, purchased store integrations, accounting and finance, information systems, purchasing and commercial revenues support staff. It should be noted that when we consummate a new acquisition, purchasing and back-office accounting functions are stripped from the new acquisitions and those functions are absorbed into our existing centralized purchasing and centralized accounting and finance departments, thus delivering cost savings.
General and administrative expenses comprised mainly of marketing, travel & entertainment, professional fees and insurance, was approximately $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, with a majority of the increase related to marketing, insurance (both property and casualty and director and officers liability insurance), professional and legal fees. The increase in professional and legal fees was due to the increase in acquisitions in 2020 and consulting fees for SOX 404 compliance. General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue were 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 4% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net Income
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $5.3 million, compared to net income of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $4 million. Net income for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily impacted by a 142.5% increase in revenues, offset slightly by an increase in cost of goods sold of 147%. Store operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 9.7% in 2020 compared to 12.7% offsetting the increase in cost of goods sold. Store income as a percentage of revenue increased from 14.9% of revenues in 2019 to 16.7 % of revenues in 2020. Income from store operations increased $20.4 million, from $11.9 million in 2019 to $32.3 million in 2020. Corporate overhead, including non-cash costs, increased $13.6 million from $10.3 million in 2019 to $23.9 million in 2020. In addition, net income was impacted by the provision for income taxes which was $3.3 million for 2020 compared to $0 for 2019. The Company had significant net operating loss carryforwards which offset taxable income in 2019 thus resulting in no provision for income taxes.

Highlights of Results of Operations Comparing Q4 2020 to Q4 2019.

● Operating cost, both store operating costs and corporate overhead decreased substantially as a percentage of revenue. Store operating costs were 10% of revenues for Q4 2020 compared to 10.8% for Q4 2019. The decrease is due to a 58% increase in same store sales which reduces stores operating costs as a percentage of revenues.

Cash Flow
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $214,000, compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of approximately $3.1 million. Cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income and adjusted by non-cash items as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share based compensation expense and changes in valuation allowances. Non-cash adjustment totaled approximately $11.1 million and approximately $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, so non-cash adjustments had a greater positive impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 than the same period in 2019. Despite net income of approximately $5.3 million and non-cash adjustments of $11.1 million for 2020, these positive adjustments were offset by increases in inventory of $19.2 million, increases in trade accounts and notes receivable of $3.5 million and increases in prepaids and other current assets of $9 million, offset by increases in trade accounts payable of $10 million, customer deposits of $2.6 million and other current liabilities of $3.3 million. Despite net income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and non-cash adjustments totaling $4.4 million, these positive adjustments were offset by increases in inventory of $10 million, increases in trade receivable of $3.8 million and increases in prepaids and other current assets of $2.1 million, offset by increases in trade accounts payable of $4.2 million, customer deposits of $2 million and other current liabilities of $495,000.
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and approximately $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in 2020 was due to the multiple asset acquisitions throughout 2020, 8 in total, in which we acquired inventory, fixed assets, goodwill and other intangibles of $40.8 million and the purchase of vehicles and store equipment to support new store operations of approximately $4 million. During 2019, we acquired 8 new stores in which we purchased inventory, fixed assets, goodwill and other intangibles of $9.5 million and the purchase of vehicles and store equipment to support new store operations of approximately $2.2 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $211 million and represented proceeds from the sale of Common Stock and exercise of warrants, net of offering costs of $211.2 million, offset by payments of long-term debt of approximately $114,400 and stock redemptions of approximately $118,800. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $13.5 million and was comprised of primarily proceeds from the sales of Common Stock and exercise of warrants, net of offering costs of $13.9 million, net of payments of long-term debt of $460,000.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding certain items in “Adjusted EBITDA,” such as non-cash equity compensation charges, provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures for internal planning and reporting purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or net income per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
As previously note, the Company has not been materially impacted by COVID, as such EBITDA has been adjusted to show the impact of covid costs which we believe to be non-recurring.
Set forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss):
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of approximately $222.9 million, compared to working capital of approximately $29 million as of December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $193.9 million. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was due primarily to the net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock of $207.1 million and exercise of warrants totaling approximately $3.8 million. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $177.9 million. Currently, we have no demands, commitments or uncertainties that would reduce our current working capital. Our core strategy continues to focus on expanding our geographic reach across the United States through organic growth and acquisitions. Based on our strategy we may need to raise additional capital in the future through equity offerings and/or debt financings. We believe that some of our store acquisitions and new store openings can come from cash flow from operations.
We anticipate that we will need additional financing in the future to continue to acquire and open new stores. To date we have financed our operations through the issuance of the sale of Common Stock, warrants and convertible debentures.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
As of January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), which introduces the balance sheet recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The Company has adopted the new lease standard using the new transition option issued under the amendments in ASU 2018-11, Leases, which allowed the Company to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, Leases, in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company made an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet. The Company will recognize those lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The impact of the adoption was an increase to the Company’s operating lease assets and liabilities on January 1, 2019 of $3.2 million.
On January 1, 2019, the Company also adopted ASU 2018-07, “Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” ASU 2018-07 more closely aligns the accounting for employee and nonemployee share-based payments. The amendment is effective commencing in 2019 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our Financial Statements.
In August 2018, the SEC adopted amendments to certain disclosure requirements in Securities Act Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification. These amendments eliminate, modify, or integrate into other SEC requirements certain disclosure rules. Among the amendments is the requirement to present an analysis of changes in stockholders’ equity in the interim financial statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The analysis, which can be presented as a footnote or separate statement, is required for the current and comparative quarter and year-to-date interim periods. The amendments are effective for all filings made on or after November 5, 2018. The Company adopted these amendments in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The new guidance modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. The amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this new guidance, effective January 1, 2020, did not have a material impact on our Financial Statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Pending Adoption
As an emerging growth company, the Company is permitted to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” changing the impairment model for most financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an allowance for expected losses, rather than incurred losses as required currently by the other-than-temporary impairment model. The ASU will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, changing effective dates for the new standards to give implementation relief to certain types of entities. The Company is required to adopt the new standards no later than January 1, 2023 according to ASU 2019-10, with early adoption allowed. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance in ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment. Under the amendments in the new ASU, goodwill impairment testing will be performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and also simplification of areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial statements and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or rate changes. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim reporting periods within those periods. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options: Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. ASU 2020-06 requires entities to provide expanded disclosures about “the terms and features of convertible instruments,” how the instruments have been reported in the entity’s financial statements, and “information about events, conditions, and circumstances that can affect how to assess the amount or timing of an entity’s future cash flows related to those instruments.”
ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that are not smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
