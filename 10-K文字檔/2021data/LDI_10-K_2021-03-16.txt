Overview
loanDepot is a customer-centric and technology-enabled residential mortgage platform. We launched our business in 2010 to provide mortgage loan solutions to consumers who were dissatisfied with the services offered by banks and other traditional market participants. Since our inception, we have significantly expanded our origination platform both in terms of size and capabilities. Our primary sources of revenue are derived from the origination of conventional and government mortgage loans, servicing conventional and government mortgage loans, and providing a growing suite of ancillary services.
On February 11, 2021 we completed the IPO of 3,850,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share, at an offering price of $14.00 per share, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1. We are a publicly traded company whose Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “LDI.”
A summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
Key Factors Influencing Our Results of Operations
Market and Economic Environment
According to the Federal Reserve, residential mortgages represent the largest segment of the broader United States consumer finance market. In 2020, annual one-to-four family residential mortgage origination volume reached $3.7 trillion, with an average volume of $2.3 trillion over the last five years. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, there was approximately $11.1 trillion of residential mortgage debt outstanding in the United States as of December 31, 2020 that is forecasted to increase to $12.4 trillion by the end of 2022.
The consumer lending market and the associated loan origination volumes for mortgage loans are influenced by interest rates and economic conditions. While borrower demand for consumer credit has typically remained strong in most economic environments, general market conditions, including the interest rate environment, unemployment rates, home price appreciation and consumer confidence may affect borrower willingness to seek financing and investor desire and ability to invest in loans. For example, a significant interest rate increase or rise in unemployment could cause potential borrowers to defer seeking financing as they wait for interest rates to stabilize or the general economic environment to improve. Additionally, if the economy weakens and actual or expected default rates increase, loan investors may postpone or reduce their investments in loan products.
The volume of mortgage loan originations associated with home purchases is generally less affected by interest rate fluctuations and more sensitive to broader economic factors as well as the overall strength of the economy and housing prices. Purchase mortgage loan origination volume can be subject to seasonal trends as home sales typically rise during the spring and summer seasons and decline in the fall and winter seasons. This is somewhat offset by purchase loan originations sourced from our joint ventures which experience their highest level of activity during November and December as home builders focus on completing and selling homes prior to year-end. Seasonality has less of an impact on mortgage loan refinancing volumes, which are primarily driven by fluctuations in mortgage loan interest rates.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
While the financial markets have demonstrated significant volatility due to the economic impacts of COVID-19, interest rates have fallen to historic lows resulting in increased mortgage refinance originations and favorable margins. Our efficient and scalable platform has enabled us to respond quickly to the increased market demand. We have highlighted below the key steps we have undertaken since the onset of the pandemic to position our platform for continued success:
•Maintained higher liquidity levels from an increase in cash from retained earnings.
•Increased our total loan funding capacity with our current lending partners.
•Stepped up protocols related to verification of key metrics such as employment and income to ensure the highest quality underwriting standards are maintained.
•Transitioned our workforce to working remotely as of March 19, 2020.
As a servicer, we are required to advance principal and interest to the investor for up to four months on GSE backed mortgages and longer on other government agency backed mortgages on behalf of clients who have entered a forbearance plan. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 2.4%, or $2.4 billion UPB, of our servicing portfolio was in active forbearance. While these advance requirements may be significant at higher levels of forbearance, we believe we are very well-positioned in terms of our liquidity. We will continue evaluating the capital markets as well, which would further supplement our liquidity should the need arise.
Fluctuations in Interest Rates
Our mortgage loan refinancing volumes (and to a lesser degree, our purchase volumes), balance sheet and results of operations are influenced by changes in interest rates and how we effectively manage the related interest rate risk. As interest rates decline, mortgage loan refinance volumes tend to increase, while an increasing interest rate environment may cause a decrease in refinance volumes and purchase volumes. In addition, the majority of our assets are subject to interest rate risk, including LHFS, which consist of mortgage loans held on our consolidated balance sheet for a short period of time after origination until we are able to sell them, IRLCs, servicing rights and mandatory trades, forward sales contracts, interest rate swap futures and put options that we enter into to manage interest rate risk created by IRLCs and uncommitted LHFS. We refer to such mandatory trades, forward sales contracts, interest rate swap futures and put options collectively as “Hedging Instruments.” As interest rates increase, our LHFS and IRLCs generally decrease in value while our Hedging Instruments utilized to hedge against interest rate risk typically increase in value. Rising interest rates cause our expected mortgage loan servicing revenues to increase due to a decline in mortgage loan prepayments which extends the average life of our servicing portfolio and increases the value of our servicing rights. Conversely, as interest rates decline, our LHFS and IRLCs generally increase in value while our Hedging Instruments decrease in value. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers tend to refinance their mortgage loans, which increases prepayment speed and causes our expected mortgage loan servicing revenues to decrease, which reduces the average life of our servicing portfolio and decreases the value of our servicing rights. The changes in fair value of our servicing rights are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in changes in fair value of servicing rights, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.
When interest rates rise, rate and term refinancings become less attractive to consumers after a historically long period of low interest rates. However, rising interest rates are also indicative of overall economic growth and inflation that should create more opportunities with respect to cash-out refinancings. In addition, inflation which may result from increases in asset prices and stronger economic growth (leading to higher consumer confidence) typically should generate more purchase-focused transactions requiring loans and greater opportunities for home equity loans, which we expect may offset, at least in part, any decline in rate and term refinancings in a rising interest rate environment.
Key Performance Indicators
We manage and assess the performance of our business by evaluating a variety of metrics. Selected key performance metrics include loan originations and sales and servicing metrics..
Loan Origination and Sales
Loan originations and sales by volume and units are a measure of how successful we are at growing sales of mortgage loan products and a metric used by management in an attempt to isolate how effectively we are performing. We believe that originations and sales are an indicator of our market penetration in mortgage loans and that this provides useful information because it allows investors to better assess the underlying growth rate of our core business. Loan originations and sales include brokered loan originations not funded by the Company. We enter into IRLCs to originate loans, at specified interest rates, with customers who have applied for a mortgage and meet certain credit and underwriting criteria. We believe the volume of our IRLCs is another measure of our growth in originations.
Gain on sale margin represents the sum of gain on sale and origination of loans, net and origination income, net divided by total loan originations for the period.
Servicing Metrics
Servicing metrics include the unpaid principal balance of our servicing portfolio and servicing portfolio units, which represent the number of mortgage loan customers we service. We believe that the net additions to our portfolio and number of units are indicators of the growth of our mortgage loans serviced and our servicing income, but may be offset by sales, from time to time, of servicing rights.
(1) Refer to the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a discussion and reconciliation of our Non-GAAP financial measures.
(2) Amount represents the fair value of servicing rights, net of servicing liabilities, which are included in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
(3) Amounts represents the fair value of servicing rights, net divided by the weighted average annualized servicing fee.
Results of Operations
Description of Components of Results of Operations
Our primary sources of revenue include gain on the origination and sale of loans, loan origination income, and servicing fee income. Changes in the fair value of our LHFS, servicing rights, and derivatives also impact our revenues. Other income reflects the pro rata share of net earnings from our joint ventures and fee income from title, escrow, and settlement services performed by our consolidated subsidiary, LD Settlement Services, LLC. Net interest income is interest income earned on our LHFS, net of interest expense on amounts borrowed under warehouse lines to finance such loans until sold.
Revenues
Net Interest Income. Net interest income reflects interest earned on LHFS offset by interest expense on amounts borrowed under warehouse lines to finance such loans until sold. For more information regarding our warehouse lines, see “-Liquidity and Capital Resources-warehouse lines” below.
Gain on Origination and Sale of Loans, Net. Gain on origination and sale of loans, net, includes cash and non-cash elements and is comprised of the following components:
•Premiums on loan sales represent the net premium or discount we receive or pay in excess of the loan principal amount and certain fees charged by investors upon sale of the loans;
•Servicing right additions represent the fair value of the servicing rights generated by loans we have sold on a servicing retained basis;
•Unrealized gains or losses on derivative assets and liabilities, interest rate lock commitments (“IRLCs”) represent the change in the fair value of IRLCs;
•Provision for loan loss obligation related to loans sold represents the provision to establish our estimated liability for loan losses that we may experience as a result of a breach of representation or warranty provided to the purchasers or insurers of loans that we have sold;
•Unrealized gains or losses from Hedging Instruments represent the gain or loss on mandatory trades, forward sales contracts, interest rate swap futures and put options hedging LHFS and IRLCs;
•Realized gains or losses from Hedging Instruments represent the gain or loss related to pair-off settlements;
•Mark to market gain or loss on loans held for sale represent the change in fair value of LHFS.
•Discount points, rebates, and lender paid costs represent discount points collected, rebates paid to borrowers, and lender paid costs for the origination of loans (including broker fee compensation paid to independent wholesale brokers and brokerage fees paid to our joint ventures for referred loans).
Origination Income, Net. Origination income, net, reflects the fees that we earn, net of lender credits we pay, from originating loans. Origination income includes loan origination fees, processing fees, underwriting fees and other fees collected from the borrower at the time of funding. Lender credits typically include rebates or concessions to borrowers for certain loan origination costs.
Servicing Fee Income. Servicing fee income reflects contractual servicing fees and ancillary and other fees (including late charges) related to the servicing of mortgage loans.
Change in Fair Value of Servicing Rights, Net. Change in fair value of servicing rights, net reflects both (i) changes in the fair value of servicing rights and (ii) gain or loss on sale of servicing rights. Changes in the fair value of servicing rights are
influenced by borrower prepayment expectations and actual borrower prepayments (including through a mortgage loan refinancing) relating to the underlying loans that are, in turn, primarily influenced by interest rate levels and expectations.
Other Income. Other income reflects our pro rata share of the net earnings from joint ventures, fee income from title, escrow and settlement services for mortgage loan transactions performed by LDSS, a consolidated subsidiary which provides these services to our customers in conjunction with their real estate transactions.
Expenses
Personnel Expense. Personnel expense reflects employee compensation related to salaries, commissions, incentive compensation, benefits and other employee costs.
Marketing and Advertising Expense. Marketing and advertising expense primarily reflects online advertising costs, including fees paid to search engines, television, print and radio, distribution partners, master service agreements with brokers and desk rental agreements with realtors. We expense and do not capitalize any of our marketing spend.
Direct Origination Expense. Direct origination expense reflects the unreimbursed portion of direct out-of-pocket expenses that we incur in the loan origination process, including underwriting, appraisal, credit report, loan document and other expenses paid to non-affiliates.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense reflects professional fees, data processing expense, communications expense and other operating expenses.
Occupancy Expense. Occupancy expense reflects our lease costs, utilities, maintenance and security expenses related to the operation of our facilities.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization reflects depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of software development, amortization of assets under financing leases and amortization of intangible assets.
Subservicing Expense. Subservicing expense reflects the amounts that we pay to our subservicers to service our mortgage loan servicing portfolio.
Other Interest Expense. Other interest expense comprises costs for debt obligations and financing lease obligations. For more information regarding the debt obligations, see “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
The following table sets forth our consolidated financial statement data for the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net income was $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.0 billion, compared to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total originations were $100.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $45.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $55.4 billion or 122.3%. Of the total originations for the year ended December 31, 2020, our Retail and Partner Channels originated $80.3 billion and $20.5 billion, respectively, as compared to $32.7 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. We generated additional revenue and net income growth related to increased IRLCs and mortgage loan originations across all business channels. Our operating results were positively influenced by an attractive mortgage loan origination market during 2020 due to the decline in interest rates as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The decrease in interest rates resulted in an increase in IRLCs and mortgage loan origination volumes.
Revenues
Net Interest Income (Expense). Net interest income was $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net interest expense of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $14.2 million or 512.1%. The increase between periods was comprised of:
• an increase of $15.3 million or 12.0% in interest income from the $1.2 billion increase in average balances of LHFS to $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by a reduction in the yield on LHFS between periods. The increase in average balances was a result of increased originations between periods. The decrease in yield was due to the decline in mortgage interest rates during the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Mortgage interest rates remained relatively flat before increasing toward the end of 2020.
• an increase in interest expense of $1.1 million or 0.8% from a $1.1 billion increase in the average balance of warehouse and other lines of credit to $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by a reduction in the cost of warehouse lines. The increase in average warehouse and other lines of credit balances was the result of increased utilization from higher originations between periods. The decrease in cost of warehouse and other lines of credit was due to decreases in 30-day LIBOR during the first and second quarters of 2020. The 30-day LIBOR remained relatively flat during the remainder of 2020.
Gain on Origination and Sale of Loans, Net. Gain on origination and sale of loans, net, was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $2.9 billion or 259.4%. Gain on origination and sale of loans, net was comprised of the following components:
Changes in the components of gain on origination and sale of loans, net, during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following:
• $3.2 billion in net premiums realized upon the sale of loans to investors for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $905.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $2.3 billion or 251.1%. The increase in net premiums realized upon the sale of loans to investors was a result of increased origination and sale volume as well as improved gain on sale margins. Gain on sale margin for 2020 was 4.27% compared to 2.81% for 2019.
• $986.1 million in servicing rights additions from loans sold to investors on a servicing-retained basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $334.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $651.9 million or 195.1%, which was driven by an increase in volume of loans sold on a servicing-retained basis to $87.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by decreases in estimated servicing multiples and servicing fees between periods. The decreases in servicing multiples was attributable to higher estimated prepayment speeds resulting from
the decreases in mortgage interest rates between periods. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average prepayment speed of our servicing portfolio was 14.0% compared to 13.3% as of December 31, 2019.
• $518.8 million of net unrealized gains from IRLCs for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $451.1 million or 665.9%. The increase was primarily due to the increase in volume of IRLCs of $85.7 billion, or 113.9% to $161.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $75.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019;
• $648.3 million of realized and unrealized losses from Hedging Instruments for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $110.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the overall decline in interest rates during 2020 and the resulting increase in origination volumes and hedging activity during 2020;
• $148.5 million of rebates paid to borrowers and lender paid costs, net of discount points collected from borrowers for the origination of loans for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $72.6 million or 95.6%. The increase is related to the increase in origination volumes between periods;
• $185.9 million of fair value gains on LHFS for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average balance of LHFS during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, coupled with the impact of changes in the mortgage interest rate environment; and
• $26.0 million of provision for loan loss obligations recorded for loans sold during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $17.3 million or 199.5%. The provision for loan loss obligations recorded reflects loan sale volumes which increased to $97.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $43.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019;
Origination Income, Net. Origination income, net, was $258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $149.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $109.3 million or 73.1%. The increase in origination income, net, between periods was primarily the result of an increase in loan originations and other loan fees attributable to the growth in loan origination volumes.
Servicing Fee Income. Servicing fee income was $185.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $67.5 million or 57.0%. The increase in servicing fee income between periods was the result of an increase of $32.0 billion in the average UPB of our servicing portfolio due to an increase in servicing-retained loan sales. Our average servicing portfolio increased to $62.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $30.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Change in Fair Value of Servicing Rights, Net. Change in fair value of servicing rights, net was a loss of $284.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $119.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase in loss of $165.0 million or 138.0%, due to the increase in size of our servicing portfolio which partially contributed to:
• $81.3 million in unrealized fair value losses, net of hedging gains, on servicing rights for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to losses of $30.1 million, net of hedging gains for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to declining interest rates during both the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019;
• $200.5 million in realized losses resulting from increases in fallout and decay of the portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of increased prepayment speeds due to decreases in market interest rates, compared to $85.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average prepayment speed of our servicing portfolio was 14.0% compared to 13.3% as of December 31, 2019; and
• $2.7 million in realized losses on sales of servicing rights associated with the sale of $972.0 million in UPB during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.0 million in realized losses associated with the sale of $12.5 billion in UPB during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Income. Other income was $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $28.7 million or 43.7%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of an increase of $34.6 million in escrow and title fee income due to increased mortgage loan settlement services, partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in income from our investments in joint ventures to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and was primarily attributable to the sale and wind down of two of our joint ventures in 2019 coupled with reductions in net income from a joint venture related to changes in pricing structure, partially offset by increases in loan originations. Additionally, there was a decrease of $2.5 million in other income primarily attributable to sale of trading securities during the fourth quarter of 2019 and resulting decreases in income from trading securities to zero for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Expenses
Personnel Expense. Personnel expense was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $765.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $766.1 million or 100.1%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of an increase of $414.2 million in commissions due to the increase in loan origination volumes, coupled with increases in salaries and benefits expense due to the increase in headcount associated with the growth of our lending operation to support the increased loan origination volumes. As of December 31, 2020, we had 9,892 employees, as compared to 6,592 employees as of December 31, 2019, representing a 50.1% year-over-year increase.
Marketing and Advertising Expense. Marketing and advertising expense was $264.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $76.5 million or 40.7%. The increase was driven by our national brand campaign and additional acquired leads.
Direct Origination Expense. Direct origination expense was $124.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $31.2 million or 33.4%. The increase between periods was directly attributable to increased costs for underwriting, credit reports, appraisals, loan documents and other loan origination costs associated with increased loan origination volumes during the period.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was $171.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $71.2 million or 70.9%.

The increase between periods was primarily the result of additional expansion of our retail locations between periods.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $37.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $1.7 million or 4.6%. The decrease between periods was the result of a higher portion of property and equipment, including technology hardware upgrades and internally developed software, becoming fully amortized.
Subservicing Expense. Subservicing expense was $81.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $40.3 million or 97.4%. The increase between periods was the result of the $32.0 billion increase in our average servicing portfolio to $62.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $30.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Interest Expense. Other interest expense was $48.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $6.7 million or 16.2%. The increase between periods driven by the issuance of $500.0 million Senior Notes in October 2020 and an increase in draws on secured credit facilities, partially offset by decreases of $250.0 million from payoff of the Unsecured Term Loan and $75.0 million from payoff of the Convertible Debt.
Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a benefit of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We generated additional revenue and net income growth related to increased IRLCs and mortgage loan originations across all business channels. Our operating results were positively influenced by an attractive mortgage loan origination market during the year ended December 31, 2019 during which interest rates remained relatively flat during the first half of the year before declining throughout the second half of 2019, resulting in an increase in IRLCs and mortgage loan origination volumes between periods.
Revenues
Net Interest Income (Expense). Net interest expense was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net interest income of $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $20.1 million or 116.0%. The decrease between periods was comprised of:
• an increase of $5.5 million or 4.5% in interest income resulting from the $564.8 million increase in average balances of LHFS from $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by a reduction in the yield on LHFS between periods. The increase in average loan balances was a result of the increases in originations between periods. The decrease in yield on LHFS was due to the decreases in market interest rates throughout 2019.
• an increase in interest expense of $25.6 million or 24.4% resulting from the $562.5 million increase in average warehouse and other lines of credit balances from $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by a reduction in the cost of warehouse and other lines of credit balances between periods.

Gain on Origination and Sale of Loans, Net. Gain on origination and sale of loans, net, was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $799.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $326.3 million or 40.8%. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in loan originations during the period. The components of gain on origination and sale of loans, net, are as follows:
Changes in the components of gain on origination and sale of loans, net, during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were comprised of the following:
• $905.3 million in net premiums realized upon the sale of loans to investors for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $496.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $408.8 million or 82.3%. This increase was a result of the increase in loans sold between periods. During the year ended December 31, 2019, loans sold increased $10.7 billion, or 32.8% to $45.3 billion from $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018;
• $334.2 million in retained servicing rights from loans sold to investors on a servicing-retained basis for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $343.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $8.9 million or 2.6%, which was driven by a decrease in estimated servicing multiples from 3.9x as of December 31, 2018 to 3.6x as of December 31, 2019, coupled with a decrease in volume of loans sold on a servicing-retained basis to $23.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $26.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average prepayment speed of our servicing portfolio was 13.3%, compared to 10.9% at December 31, 2018 and 11.0% at December 31, 2017;
• $67.7 million of unrealized gains from IRLCs for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to unrealized losses of $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $99.1 million or 316.2%. The increase was primarily due to the changes in interest rates and resulting $24.9 billion, or 49.4% increase in volume of IRLCs to $75.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $50.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018;
• $110.7 million of realized and unrealized losses from Hedging Instruments for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $67.9 million of realized and unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2018.

• $75.9 million of rebates paid to borrowers and lender paid costs, net of discount points collected from borrowers for the origination of loans for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $7.4 million or 8.9%;
• $14.0 million of fair value gains on LHFS for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the decreasing interest rate environment near the end of 2019, as compared to the rising interest rate environment near the end of 2018; and
• $8.7 million of provision for loan loss obligations recorded for loans sold during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a reversal of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $12.0 million or 364.4%. The provision for loan loss obligations recorded reflects loan sale volumes which
increased to $43.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $32.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018;
Origination Income, Net. Origination income, net, was $149.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $153.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $3.5 million or 2.3%. The decrease in origination income, net, between periods was primarily the result of decreases in loan origination fees resulting from (i) increased lender credits due to the competitive pricing market for loans in 2019 and (ii) decreases in fees from personal loans due to the discontinuation of consumer lending in 2018, partially offset by the increase in other loan fees attributable to the growth in loan origination volumes.
Servicing Income. Servicing income was $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $141.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $22.8 million or 16.1%. The decrease in servicing income between periods was the result of a decrease of $10.9 billion in the average UPB of our servicing portfolio from a decrease in servicing-retained loan sales and bulk sales of servicing rights during 2019. Our average servicing portfolio decreased to $30.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $41.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Change in Fair Value of Servicing Rights, Net. Change in fair value of servicing rights, net was a loss of $119.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a loss of $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase in loss of $68.1 million or 132.2%. The increase in losses was the result of:
• $30.1 million in fair value losses, net of hedging gains, on servicing rights for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to fair value gains of $20.5 million, net of hedging gains for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decline in interest rates during the second half of 2019;
• $85.4 million in realized losses resulting from increases in fallout and decay of the portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of increased prepayment speeds due to decreases in market interest rates during the second half of 2019, compared to $71.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018; and
• $4.0 million in realized losses on sales of servicing rights associated with the sale of $12.5 billion in UPB during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a $1.1 million loss associated with the sale of $34.8 billion in UPB during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Income.

The increase between periods was primarily the result of an increase in escrow and title fee income due to overall increased mortgage loan settlement services, partially offset by a decrease in income from our investments in joint ventures to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and was primarily attributable to the sale and wind down of two of our joint ventures in 2019 coupled with reductions in net income from a joint venture related to changes in pricing structure, partially offset by increases in loan originations.
Expenses
Personnel Expense. Personnel expense was $765.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $681.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $83.9 million or 12.3%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of an increase in commissions, salaries and benefits expense as a result of the increase in headcount associated with the growth of our lending operation to support increased loan origination volumes. As of December 31, 2019, we had 6,592 employees, as compared to 5,228 employees as of December 31, 2018, representing a 26.1% year-over-year increase.

The increase between periods was primarily the result of an increase of $2.4 million in contingent consideration liability during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a $4.9 million reduction in contingent consideration in the comparable period in 2018. The increase in contingent consideration during 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in Mortgage Master’s estimated pre-tax earnings over the earn-out period, which is a key assumption in the calculation of the contingent consideration amount. The increase was partially offset by reductions in data and communication expense, professional services and consulting expense.
Occupancy Expense. Occupancy expense was $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $1.1 million or 2.9%.

The decrease between periods was the result of the decrease of $10.9 billion in the average UPB of our servicing portfolio, which resulted from a decrease in servicing-retained loan sales and bulk sales of servicing rights during 2019. Our average servicing portfolio decreased to $30.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $41.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Interest Expense. Other interest expense was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.3 million or 0.8%. The decrease between periods was the result of the decrease in interest rates between periods, partially offset by an increase in outstanding debt obligations including additional interest expense from our Convertible Debt and an increase in financing lease obligations.
Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was a benefit of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a benefit of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $1.3 million or 268.2%.

Description of Certain Components of Consolidated Balance Sheets
Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value. Loans held for sale, at fair value, are primarily fixed and variable rate, 15- to 30-year term first-lien loans that are secured by residential property. All loans are reflected at fair value.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities, at Fair Value. Derivative assets and liabilities, at fair value, represent the fair value of IRLCs and Hedging Instruments, which may be positive or negative. We do not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than in support of our risk management activities.
Servicing Rights, at Fair Value. Servicing rights, at fair value, represent the value of a contract that obligates us to service mortgage loans on behalf of the purchaser of the loan in exchange for servicing fees and the right to collect certain ancillary income from the borrower. We recognize servicing rights at our estimate of the fair value of the contract to service the loans.
Warehouse and Other Lines of Credit. Warehouse lines and other lines of credit represent debt that is used to fund, and is secured by mortgage loans. warehouse lines are repaid using proceeds from the sale of loans. Warehouse lines carry base interest rates and may include annual facility fees, commitment fees and non-usage fees.
Debt obligations. Debt obligations consist of secured credit facilities, unsecured term loan, and convertible debt. Secured credit facilities are used for working capital purposes and to finance servicing rights and carry base interest rates plus a margin. Our unsecured term loan has a base interest rate plus a margin. Our Convertible Debt accrues interest at fixed rates that change over time and is used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes.
Loans Eligible for Repurchase/Liability for Loans Eligible for Repurchase. For certain loans guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we (as the servicer) have the unilateral right to repurchase any individual loan in a Ginnie Mae securitization pool if that loan meets defined criteria, including being delinquent greater than 90 days. Once we have the unilateral right to repurchase the delinquent loan, we have effectively gained control over the loan and must re-recognize the loan on our consolidated balance sheet and establish a corresponding liability regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan.

Equity. Prior to the IPO, we completed a reorganization which changed our equity structure to a single class of LLC Units in LD Holdings as opposed to the previous capital structure that consisted of different classes of membership interests held by Continuing LLC Members. The LLC Units were then exchanged on a one-for-one basis for Holdco Units and Class C common stock. The Continuing Members have the right to exchange one Holdco Unit and one share of Class B common stock or Class C common stock, as applicable, together for cash or one share of Class A common stock at the Company’s election, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, and reclassifications. The reorganization is considered a transaction between entities under common control, therefore, the financial statements for the periods prior to the IPO and reorganization have been adjusted to combine the previously separate entities for presentation. The financial results of
LD Holdings and its subsidiaries are consolidated with loanDepot, Inc. and the consolidated net earnings or loss are allocated to the noncontrolling interest to reflect the entitlement of the Continuing LLC Members.

The decrease between periods was primarily the result of depreciation of $36.8 million, partially offset by additions of $11.0 million related to the capitalization of internally developed software costs, $12.0 million in acquisitions of computer hardware, and $3.7 million in capital expenditures associated with the expansion of our proprietary technology and growth of our lending platform.
Operating lease right-of-use assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets were $61.7 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to zero as of December 31, 2018. The $61.7 million increase between periods was related to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019. As a result of the adoption, we recognized $71.9 million in operating lease right-of-use assets. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019 we recognized $13.7 million of new operating lease right-of-use assets in exchange for operating lease liabilities, offset by $23.9 million in amortization. There was no similar activity during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets. Prepaid expenses and other assets were $52.7 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $49.7 million as of December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $3.0 million or 6.0%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of increases in prepaid expenses associated with the growth of our origination platform and servicing portfolio.
Loans Eligible for Repurchase. Loans eligible for repurchase were $197.8 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $183.8 million as of December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $14.0 million or 7.6%. The increase between periods was due to the increase in Ginnie Mae serviced loans that were 90 days or more delinquent as of December 31, 2019, which was attributable to the increase in our Ginnie Mae servicing portfolio.
Investments in Joint Ventures. Investments in joint ventures were $17.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, earnings from joint ventures were $12.9 million, offset by distributions from joint ventures of $12.9 million.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net. Goodwill was $40.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Intangible assets, net, were $2.6 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $3.2 million as of December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.6 million or 19.2%. The decrease between periods was the result of $0.6 million in amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2019 associated with intangible assets acquired in the iMortgage, Mortgage Master and CUSA acquisitions.
Liabilities and Equity
Warehouse and Other Lines of Credit. Warehouse and other lines of credit were $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $1.3 billion or 63.0%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of increased loan originations across all of our channels. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we originated and sold $45.3 billion and $43.5 billion, respectively, in loans. We increased our borrowing capacity with existing lenders under our warehouse lines to $5.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2018.
Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities. Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities were $196.1 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $167.2 million as of December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $28.9 million or 17.3%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of a $32.3 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits associated with the increase in employees and an increase of $20.7 million in accounts payable related to the growth in our businesses. Partially offsetting the increases were decreases in deferred rent related to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019 and decreases in other accrued liabilities.
Derivative Liabilities, at Fair Value. Derivative liabilities, at fair value, were $10.0 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $32.6 million as of December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $22.6 million or 69.4%. The decrease was primarily related to declining market interest rates at the end of 2018, as compared to a relatively flat market interest rate environment at the end of 2019. Although notional amounts for our forward loan sale commitments increased year over year, the interest rate declines experienced at the end of 2018 resulted in a larger hedge liability. At December 31, 2019, the notional
value and fair value of forward loan sale commitments was $7.9 billion and $7.0 million, compared to $4.1 billion and $32.0 million at December 31, 2018.
Liability for Loans Eligible for Repurchase. Liability for loans eligible for repurchase was $197.8 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $183.8 million as of December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $14.0 million or 7.6%. The increase between periods was due to the increase in Ginnie Mae serviced loans that were 90 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2019, which was attributable to the increase in our Ginnie Mae servicing portfolio.
Operating lease liability. Operating lease liability was $80.3 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to zero as of December 31, 2018. The $80.3 million increase between periods was related to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019. As a result of the adoption, we recognized a $94.9 million operating lease liability. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019 we recognized $13.7 million of new operating lease liabilities. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, operating lease liabilities were reduced by $34.0 million in cash payments for operating leases, offset by $5.6 million of interest accretion. There was no similar activity during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Financing Lease Obligations. Financing lease obligations were $33.8 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $29.8 million as of December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $4.0 million or 13.5%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of $7.8 million in proceeds from the financing of previously acquired assets and $14.2 million of purchases of equipment under financing leases to help facilitate the current and future growth of our business, partially offset by payments under financing lease obligations of $18.0 million.
Debt Obligations. Debt obligations were $592.1 million as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $547.9 million as of December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $44.2 million or 8.1%. The increase between periods was primarily the result of the Company entering into an agreement for the Convertible Debt of $50.0 million in August 2019, partially offset by the payoff of the Company's $8.0 million Securities Financing in May 2019.
Equity. Noncontrolling interests was $375.9 million and $348.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 respectively. The $27.0 million or 7.7% increase in equity between periods was primarily the result of $34.4 million of net income generated and $0.2 million in equity-based compensation, partially offset by $7.6 million in dividend payments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Our liquidity reflects our ability to meet our current obligations (including our operating expenses and, when applicable, the retirement of our debt and margin calls relating to our Hedging Instruments, warehouse lines and Secured Credit Facilities), fund new originations and purchases, meet servicing requirements, and make investments as we identify them. We forecast the need to have adequate liquid funds available to operate and grow our business. As of December 31, 2020, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were $284.2 million and committed and uncommitted available capacity under our warehouse lines was $1.5 billion.
We fund substantially all of the mortgage loans we close through borrowings under our warehouse lines. Given the broad impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets, our future ability to borrow money to fund our current and future loan production is unknown. Our mortgage origination liquidity could also be affected as our lenders reassess their exposure to the mortgage origination industry and either curtail access to uncommitted mortgage warehouse financing capacity or impose higher costs to access such capacity. Our liquidity may be further constrained as there may be less demand by investors to acquire our mortgage loans in the secondary market. Even if such demand exists, we face a substantially higher repurchase risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic stemming from our clients inability to repay the underlying loans. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased our cash position and total loan funding capacity with our current and new lending partners.
As a servicer, we are required to advance principal and interest to the investor for up to four months on GSE backed mortgages and longer on other government agency backed mortgages on behalf of clients who have entered a forbearance plan. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 2.4%, or $2.4 billion UPB, of our servicing portfolio was in active forbearance. While these advance requirements may be significant at higher levels of forbearance, we believe we are very well-positioned in
terms of our liquidity. In September 2020, we entered into a variable funding note facility for the financing of servicing advance receivables with respect to residential mortgage loans serviced by us on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We will continue evaluating the capital markets as well, which would further supplement our liquidity should the need arise.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Our primary sources of liquidity have been as follows: (i) funds obtained from our warehouse lines; (ii) proceeds from debt obligations; (iii) proceeds received from the sale and securitization of loans; (iv) proceeds from the sale of servicing rights; (v) loan fees from the origination of loans; (vi) servicing fees; (vii) title and escrow fees from settlement services, (viii) real estate referral fees, and (ix) interest income from LHFS.
Our primary uses of funds for liquidity have included the following: (i) funding mortgage loans; (ii) funding loan origination costs; (iii) payment of warehouse line haircuts required at loan origination; (iv) payment of interest expense on warehouse lines; (v) payment of interest expense under debt obligations; (vi) payment of operating expenses; (vii) repayment of warehouse lines; (viii) repayment of debt obligations; (ix) funding of servicing advances; (x) margin calls on warehouse lines or Hedging Instruments; (xi) payment of distributions and other amounts due to the holders of common units; (xii) payments of cash dividends subject to the discretion of our board of directors, (xiii) repurchases of loans under representation and warranty breaches; (ix) earnout payments from acquisitions, and (x) costs relating to subservicing.
We rely on the secondary mortgage market as a source of long-term capital to support our mortgage lending operations. Approximately 90% of the mortgage loans that we originated during the year ended December 31, 2020 were sold in the secondary mortgage market to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or, in the case of MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, are mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by the FHA or VA. We also sell loans to many private investors.
At this time, we believe that there are no material market trends that would affect our access to long-term or short-term borrowings sufficient to maintain our current operations, or that would likely cause us to cease to be in compliance with applicable covenants for our indebtedness or that would inhibit our ability to fund our loan operations and capital commitments for the next twelve months. However, should those trends change, we believe we could retain less or sell additional servicing rights, scale back growth or take other actions to mitigate any significant increase in demands on our liquidity.
Warehouse Lines and Debt Obligations
Warehouse lines are discussed in Note 12- Warehouse and Other Lines of Credit and debt obligations are discussed in Note 13- Debt Obligations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We finance most of our loan originations on a short-term basis using our warehouse lines. Under our warehouse lines, we agree to transfer certain loans to our counterparties against the transfer of funds by them, with a simultaneous agreement by the counterparties to transfer the loans back to us at the date loans are sold, or on demand by us, against the transfer of funds from us. We do not recognize these transfers as sales for accounting purposes. We typically repurchase the loans within 6 to 15 days of funding. Our warehouse lines are short-term borrowings which mature in less than one year with the exception of our securitization facilities which have terms of two and three years. We utilize both committed and uncommitted loan funding facilities and we evaluate our needs under these facilities based on forecasted volume of loan originations and sales.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $8.1 billion of capacity under our warehouse lines, of which $2.8 billion was committed. Our $8.1 billion of capacity as of December 31, 2020 was comprised of $7.0 billion with maturities staggered throughout 2021, $600.0 million maturing in 2022 and $500.0 million maturing in 2023. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained warehouse lines with fourteen counterparties. Our warehouse lines typically have terms of one year and are routinely renewed annually. As of December 31, 2020, we had $6.6 billion of borrowings outstanding under these facilities and $1.5 billion of additional availability under our facilities.
When we draw on the warehouse lines, we must pledge eligible loan collateral and make a capital investment, or “haircut,” upon financing the loans, which is generally determined by the type of collateral provided and the warehouse line terms. Our warehouse line providers require a haircut based on product types and the market value of the loans. The haircuts are normally recovered from sales proceeds. With the expected future increase in loan origination volumes, we will be required to
use additional capital for haircuts and increase our restricted cash balances with our warehouse lenders. As of December 31, 2020, we had $6.7 million in restricted cash posted as additional collateral with our warehouse lenders, as compared to $4.4 million as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we had $170.4 million in restricted cash posted as additional collateral for our securitization facilities, as compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.
Interest on our warehouse lines varies by facility and depends on the type of loan that is being financed or the period of time that a loan is transferred to our warehouse line counterparty. As of December 31, 2020, interest expense under our warehouse lines was generally based on 30-day LIBOR plus a margin and in some cases a minimum interest rate and certain commitment and utilization fees apply. Interest is generally payable monthly in arrears or on the repurchase date of a loan, and outstanding principal is payable upon receipt of loan sale proceeds or on the repurchase date of a loan. Outstanding principal related to a particular loan must also be repaid after the expiration of a contractual period of time or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of certain events of default with respect to the underlying loan.
Our warehouse lines require us to comply with various financial covenants including tangible net worth, liquidity, leverage ratios and net income. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our warehouse lending covenants. Although these financial covenants limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and affect our liquidity through minimum cash reserve requirements, we believe that these covenants currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to successfully operate our business and obtain the financing necessary to achieve that purpose.
Secured debt obligations as of December 31, 2020 totaled $221.2 million net of $2.4 million of deferred financing costs, as compared to $294.0 million net of $1.9 million of deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2019. Secured debt obligations as of December 31, 2020 included our 2020-VF1 Notes, GMSR VFN, and term notes. Secured debt obligations as of December 31, 2019 included secured credit facilities, GMSR VFN, and term notes. The 2020-VF1 Notes are secured by loanDepot.com, LLC’s rights to reimbursement for advances made pursuant to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements and mature in September 2021 (unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms). The GMSR VFN is secured by Ginnie Mae mortgage servicing rights and matures in October 2021. The Term Notes are secured by certain participation certificates relating to Ginnie Mae mortgage servicing rights pursuant to the terms of a base indenture and mature in October 2023. The 2020-VF1 Notes, GMSR VFN, and term notes accrue interest at 30-day LIBOR plus a margin per annum. Our secured debt obligations require us to satisfy certain financial covenants, we were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Unsecured debt obligations as of December 31, 2020 totaled $491.3 million net of $8.7 million of deferred financing costs, as compared to $298.0 million net of $2.0 million of deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2019. Unsecured debt obligations as of December 31, 2020 consisted of our Senior Notes issued in October 2020. The Senior Notes will mature on November 1, 2025. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at a rate of 6.50% per annum. Unsecured debt obligations as of December 31, 2019 consisted of our unsecured term loan and convertible debt that were repaid in October 2020.
Dividends and Distributions
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid dividends and distributions to holders of LLC Units under LD Holdings of $643.1 million and redeemed LLC Units of $97.6 million.
Beginning with second quarter of 2021, we intend to pay cash dividends subject to the discretion of our board of directors and our compliance with applicable law, and depending on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, including the satisfaction of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement, restrictions in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
Our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization or agreements of our subsidiaries, including agreements governing our indebtedness. Future agreements may also limit our ability to pay dividends.
Financing Lease Transactions
We lease certain equipment under agreements that are classified as financing leases. The cost of equipment under financing leases, net of accumulated amortization, is included in property and equipment, net in our consolidated balance
sheets. At December 31, 2020, financing lease obligations had original lease terms of three years. The transactions have been accounted for as financing arrangements, wherein the property remains on our books and continues to be depreciated. We have the option to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the leases.
Interest expense incurred on financing leases during the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $1.7 million, $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and is included in other interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2020, we decreased our financing lease obligations to $3.4 million as compared to $33.8 million at December 31, 2019 as the result of the early payoff of several financing leases during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Margin Calls
Our warehouse lines, secured credit facilities, and certain derivative financial instruments contain margin call provisions that, under specific market conditions and terms, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. Under our warehouse lines, secured credit facilities and certain derivative financial instruments, a margin deficit will generally result from any decline in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to the related financing agreement. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:
(1) Amounts exclude $11.1 million in deferred financing costs at December 31, 2020.
(2) Represents lease obligations for office space under non-cancelable operation lease agreements.
(3) Represents lease obligations for equipment under non-cancelable financing lease agreements.
In addition to the above contractual obligations, we also had commitments to originate loans of $31.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Commitments to originate loans do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements as some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and, therefore, those commitments have been excluded from the table above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we were party to mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements, pursuant to which we have access to uncommitted facilities that provide liquidity for recently sold MBS up to the MBS settlement date. These facilities, which we refer to as gestation facilities, are a component of our financing strategy and are off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (ii) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.
When reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We use fair value measurements in fair value disclosures and to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis (such as servicing rights, IRLCs, LHFS and Hedging Instruments). We have elected fair value accounting for servicing rights and LHFS, as permitted under current accounting guidance, to more closely align our accounting with our interest rate risk management strategies.
When observable market prices do not exist for our financial instruments, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other valuation models. Our valuation models may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs, such as discount rates, prepayment speeds, default rates and cost of servicing, is generally more subjective and involves a higher degree of management judgment and assumptions than the measurement of fair value using observable inputs. These judgments and assumptions may have a significant effect on our measurements of fair value, and the use of different judgments and assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could have a material effect on our statements of operations as well as our balance sheets.
Loans Held for Sale
Loans that are intended to be sold in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgage loans, are reported as LHFS. We account for LHFS under the fair value option. Fair value of LHFS is typically calculated using observable market information, including pricing from actual market transactions or observable market prices from other loans that have similar collateral, credit, and interest rate characteristics. Gains or losses from the sale of loans are recognized based upon the difference between the selling price and fair value of the related loans upon the sale of such loans.
In order to facilitate the origination and sale of loans, we have entered into various agreements with warehouse lenders. These agreements are in the form of loan participations and repurchase agreements with banks and other financial institutions. LHFS are considered sold when we surrender control over the financial assets and those financial assets are legally isolated from us in the event of our bankruptcy. We account for all repurchase agreements as secured borrowings.
Servicing Rights
Servicing rights are assets that are created when the loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. Servicing of loans includes payment processing, remittance of funds to investors, collection of delinquent payments, and, in the case of mortgage loans, payment of taxes and insurance and disposition of foreclosed properties. In return for these services, we receive servicing fee income and ancillary fee income. The servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value, which is estimated by using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of
the cost of servicing, the discount rate, the float value, the inflation rate, estimated prepayment speeds and default rates. We use a dynamic model to estimate the fair value of our servicing rights. These judgments and assumptions may have a significant effect on our measurements of the servicing rights, and the use of different judgments and assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could have a material effect on our statements of operations as well as our balance sheets
We have elected to account for the measurement of servicing rights using the fair value method, whereby the servicing rights are initially recorded on our balance sheet at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings during the period in which the changes in fair value occur. We believe that accounting for servicing rights at fair value best reflects the impact of current market conditions on our servicing rights, and our investors and other users of our financial statements will have greater insight into management’s views as to the value of our servicing rights at each reporting date. The fair value of the servicing rights is assessed at each reporting date using the methods described above.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into derivative instruments to serve the financial needs of our customers and to reduce our risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. For example, we enter into IRLCs with certain customers to originate residential mortgage loans at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time. IRLCs on loans that are intended to be sold are accounted for as derivatives, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as part of gain on origination and sale of loans, net. The fair value of an IRLC is based upon changes in the fair value of the underlying loans estimated to be realizable upon sale into the secondary market. In estimating the fair value of an IRLC, we also adjust the fair value of the underlying loan to reflect the estimated pull-through rate of commitments that will result in a closed loan; our estimate of this percentage will primarily vary based on the age of the underlying commitment, the underlying loan’s current status in the origination process and changes in loan interest rates.
The primary factor influencing the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC, prior to a loan package being submitted to underwriting, is the change, if any, in interest rates subsequent to the commitment date. In general, the probability of funding increases if interest rates rise and decreases if interest rates fall. This is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current interest rates compared to the applicant’s committed rate. Once a loan package is submitted to underwriting, the current status of the loan in the origination process is the primary factor influencing the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC. Additionally, the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC is influenced by the source of the application, age of the application, purpose of the loan (purchase or non-purchase) and the application approval rate.
We manage the interest rate risk associated with our outstanding IRLCs, LHFS and servicing rights by entering into derivative financial instruments. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, and discounted cash flow methodologies. Fair value estimates also take into account counterparty credit risk and our own credit standing.
Loan Repurchase Reserve
Loans sold to investors by us and which met investor and Agency underwriting guidelines at the time of sale may be subject to repurchase or indemnification in the event of specific default by the borrower or subsequent discovery that underwriting standards were not met. In limited circumstances, the full risk of loss on loans sold is retained to the extent the liquidation of the underlying collateral is insufficient.
We establish a reserve for loan repurchases and indemnifications related to various representations and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Such factors include the type of loan, the channel from which it came, LTV and other loan-related specifics. The process for determining the measurement of the liability involves certain unobservable inputs such as estimated repurchase demand and repurchases, and loss severity and is generally subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. These judgments and assumptions may have a significant effect on our measurements of the liability, and the use of different judgments and assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could have a material effect on our statements of operations as well as our balance sheets.
Equity-Based Compensation
The Company’s 2009 Incentive Equity Plan, 2012 Incentive Equity Plan, and 2015 Incentive Equity Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) provide for awards of various classes of Common Units, as described in the Plans. The Company uses the grant-date fair value of equity awards to determine the compensation cost associated with each award. Grant-date fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model adjusted for unique characteristics of the specific awards. Compensation cost for service-based equity awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for awards with only service conditions that have graded vesting schedules is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award such that compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant-date value of the award that is vested at that date. Expense is reduced for actual forfeitures as they occur. The cost of equity-based compensation is recorded to personnel expense.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income as non-GAAP measures. We believe Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. They facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in hedging strategies, changes in valuations, capital structures (affecting net interest expense), taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the amortization of intangibles, which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance, as well as certain historical cost (benefit) items which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies.
We define “Adjusted Total Revenue” as total revenues, net of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and the related hedging gains and losses. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on non-funding debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of MSRs, net of the related hedging gains and losses, change in fair value of contingent consideration, stock compensation expense and management fees, and IPO related expense. We define “Adjusted Net Income” as tax-effected earnings before stock compensation expense and management fees, IPO expense, and the change in fair value of MSRs, net of the related hedging gains and losses, and the tax effects of those adjustments. Adjustments for income taxes are made to reflect LD Holdings historical results of operations on the basis that it was taxed as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. We exclude from each of these non-GAAP measures the change in fair value of MSRs and related hedging gains and losses as this represents a non-cash non-realized adjustment to our total revenues, reflecting changes in assumptions including discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in market interest rates, which is not indicative of our performance or results of operations. We also exclude stock compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense, management fees and IPO expenses as management does not consider these costs to be indicative of our performance or results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA includes interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of “net interest income (expense)”, as these expenses are a direct operating expense driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and
•they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not intended as alternatives to total revenue, net income (loss), or net income attributable to the Company or as an indicator of our operating performance and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. See below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
