4. Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation: Financial Institutions often use the "efficiency ratio", a non-GAAP ratio, as a measure of expense control. Arrow believes the efficiency ratio provides investors with information that is useful in understanding its financial performance. Arrow defines efficiency ratio as the ratio of noninterest expense to net gross income (which equals tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, as adjusted).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The significant accounting policies, as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are essential in understanding the Management Discussion and Analysis. Many of the significant accounting policies require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. Arrow has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, Arrow has used the factors that are believed to represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from estimates of the key variables could impact the results of operations.
Allowance for loan losses: The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in Arrow's loan portfolio. The process for determining the allowance for loan losses is discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5, Loans, to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Arrow evaluates the allowance at the portfolio segment level and the portfolio segments are commercial, commercial real estate, consumer loans and residential real estate. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio’s inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, and borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for loan losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for loan losses for individual commercial loans include credit quality indicators, collateral values and estimated cash flows for impaired loans. For pools of loans, Arrow considers the historical net loss experience, and as necessary, adjustments to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions. The historical net loss factors incorporate a rolling average annual twelve quarter look-back period of the respective segment that have occurred within each pool of loans over the loss emergence period (LEP), adjusted as necessary based upon consideration of qualitative considerations impacting the inherent risk of loss in the respective loan portfolios. The LEP is an estimate of the average amount of time from the point at which a loss is incurred on a loan to the point at which the loss is recognized in the financial statements. Since the LEP may change under various economic environments, the LEP calculation is updated on an annual basis. The process of determining the level of the allowance for loan losses requires a high degree of judgment. Any downward trend in the economy, regional or national, may require Arrow to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on the results of operations and financial condition.
A. OVERVIEW
The following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews Arrow's results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 and the financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The discussion below should be read in conjunction with the selected quarterly and annual information set forth above and the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this Report. When necessary, prior-year financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
COVID-19 Pandemic:
In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In response, the United States federal government and various state and local governments have, among other actions, imposed travel and business restrictions and required or advised communities in which we do business to adopt stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines, causing some businesses to adjust, reduce or suspend operating activities. Like many businesses, Arrow expects the operations and financial results to continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current pandemic are still uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict.
Arrow continues to manage its COVID-19 response with health and safety concerns as a top priority. Throughout 2020, the Business Continuity Task Force, representing leadership from across the organization, focused on maintaining protocols that have allowed Arrow to continue operations. Arrow actively monitors developments, and if future restrictions are imposed, is confident in its ability to continue to provide essential banking services and meet customer needs.
Arrow provided full access at its facilities or appointment-only access depending on conditions present at that time. Drive-ins and ATMs are open, and Arrow continues to promote digital banking alternatives. Inside Arrow's facilities, safety measures continue to be followed, including required face coverings, social distancing and personal protective equipment such as shields and hand sanitizing stations, along with frequent cleanings. Remote work is encouraged whenever feasible for employees. In addition, work-related travel remains paused and in-person meetings have been minimized. Arrow remains committed to delivering essential financial services to its communities.
Requests for financial hardship assistance were reduced from early pandemic levels. Loans being deferred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic were $15.3 million, or 0.6% of loans outstanding, as of December 31, 2020. Arrow worked closely with small business borrowers from the initial round of PPP loans on the forgiveness process. Arrow is currently helping customers obtain funding through an additional round of PPP support. As of year-end, Arrow had assisted more than 1,400 small businesses, with more than $142.7 million in aggregate PPP loans.
While COVID-19 did not have a material adverse effect on 2020 financial results, Arrow is actively monitoring the impact of the pandemic on the business and results of operations.
As Arrow cannot predict the duration or scope of the pandemic or its impact on economic and financial markets or its impact on the business, Arrow is unable to reasonably estimate the overall impact on the Company. For further discussion of the impact COVID-19 has had and may in the future have on Arrow and its financial results and operations, please refer to the Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A, beginning on page 13 of this Report.
Summary of 2020 Financial Results: For the year ended December 31, 2020, net income was a record $40.8 million, up 8.9% over net income of $37.5 million for 2019. Diluted EPS was $2.64 for 2020, up 8.5% from $2.43 in 2019.
Arrow's profitability ratios remained solid in 2020, as return on average equity and return on average assets were 12.77% and 1.17%, respectively, for the year, as compared to 13.17% and 1.24%, respectively, for 2019.
At December 31, 2020, total loan balances reached $2.6 billion, up $209 million, or 8.8%, from the prior-year level. The consumer loan portfolio grew by $48.6 million, or 6.0%, over the balance at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of continued strength in the indirect automobile lending program. The residential real estate loan portfolio increased $9.2 million, or 1.0%. The increase in the real estate loan portfolio is net of approximately $83.9 million of loans sold in 2020. Commercial loans, including commercial real estate, increased $151.1 million, or 22.9%, over the balances at December 31, 2019. The increase in commercial loans includes $110.4 million in remaining PPP loans.
At December 31, 2020, total deposit balances reached $3.2 billion, up by $618.7 million, or 23.6%, from the prior-year level. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew by $216.4 million, or 44.6%, during 2020, and represented 21.7% of total deposits at year-end as compared to the prior-year level of 18.5%. At December 31, 2020, total time deposits decreased $117.7 million from the prior-year level, including a reduction of $80.6 million in brokered time deposits.
Net interest income for the year ending December 31, 2020 was $99.2 million, an increase of $11.2 million, or 12.7%, from the prior year. Loan growth generated $100.5 million in interest and fees on loans, an increase of 5.3% from the $95.5 million in interest and fees on loans for the year ending December 31, 2019. Interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2020 was $12.7 million. This is a decrease of $9.0 million, or 41.5%, from the $21.7 million in expense for the year ending December 31, 2019. The net interest margin was 2.99% for the year ending December 31, 2020, as compared to 3.05% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net interest margin from the prior year was due to a variety of factors, including lower interest rates, increased cash balances and the impact of participating in the PPP.
Noninterest income was $32.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2020, an increase of 14.4% as compared to $28.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.3 million due to a variety of factors, including strong demand for residential mortgages in our operating markets, favorable market conditions for mortgage sales and strategic balance sheet and interest-rate risk management decisions. Income generated from fiduciary activities as well as fees for other services from customers were flat compared to the prior year. Insurance revenue decreased by $306 thousand from the prior year. Noninterest income represented 24.8% of total revenues in 2020 as compared to 24.5% for the year ending December 31, 2019. Other operating income increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 as a result of several factors, including gain on sale of
fixed assets and other real estate owned, as well as increased income related to interest rate swap agreements and bank owned life insurance.
Noninterest expense for the year ending December 31, 2020 increased by $3.2 million, or 4.8%, to $70.7 million compared to $67.5 million in 2019. The largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and benefits paid to our employees, which totaled $42.1 million in 2020, as compared to $38.4 million in 2019.
In 2020, Arrow opened a 12th Saratoga National Bank Branch, as well as a Capital Region Business Development Office in Latham, New York. Additionally, Glens Falls National Bank consolidated Branches in Queensbury and Greenwich into nearby locations.
Asset quality remained strong in 2020, as evidenced by low levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Net loan losses for the full year 2020 were 0.05% of average loans outstanding, consistent with the 2019 ratio. Nonperforming assets of $6.6 million at December 31, 2020, represented 0.18% of period-end assets, consistent with December 31, 2019.
Arrow's allowance for loan losses was $29.2 million at December 31, 2020, which represented 1.13% of loans outstanding, an increase from 0.89% at year-end 2019. Although credit quality remains strong, the increase in the allowance reflects the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. When expressed as a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan loss coverage ratio was 456.3% at year-end 2020. Arrow adopted the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting standard as of January 1, 2021.
At December 31, 2020, Arrow’s liquidity position was strong. Interest-bearing cash balances at December 31, 2020 were $338.9 million. Arrow continues to be well-prepared to address any unexpected volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may affect cash flow and deposit balances. At December 31, 2020, contingent collateralized lines of credit available through the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Federal Reserve Bank, totaled $1.5 billion. Arrow also has additional liquidity options currently available, including unsecured Fed Funds lines of credit and brokered deposit markets.
The changes in net income, net interest income and net interest margin between the current and prior year are discussed in detail under the heading "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS," beginning on page 32.
Regulatory Capital and Increase in Stockholders' Equity: As of December 31, 2020, Arrow continued to exceed all required minimum capital ratios under the current bank regulatory capital rules as implemented under Dodd-Frank (the "Capital Rules") at both the holding company and bank levels. At that date, both subsidiary banks, as well as the holding company, continued to qualify as "well-capitalized" under the capital classification guidelines as defined by the Capital Rules. Because of continued profitability and strong asset quality, the regulatory capital levels throughout recent years have consistently remained well in excess of the various required regulatory minimums in effect from time to time, as they do at present. Pursuant to the Capital Rules, required minimum regulatory capital levels for insured banks and their parent holding companies increased in 2019.
The federal bank regulators have issued a final rule to implement the “community bank leverage ratio”, introducing an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations ("CBLR"). To qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must satisfy certain requirements, including having a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all the requirements under the CBLR framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the “prompt corrective action” regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital ratios. Subsequently, Section 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act required the federal banking agencies to temporarily lower the threshold for election of the CBLR framework, issuing two interim final rules to set the CBLR at 8% as of the second quarter of 2020 and then gradually re-establish the CBLR at 9%.
Under the final rule, the CBLR remained at 8% through the end of 2020. Community banks that have a leverage ratio of 8% or greater and meet certain other criteria may elect to use the CBLR framework. Beginning in 2021, the CBLR increased to 8.5% for the calendar year. Community banks will have until January 1, 2022, before the leverage ratio requirement to use the CBLR framework will return to 9%.
The final rule also maintains a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than one percentage point below the applicable CBLR requirement.
The CBLR final rule became effective as of January 1, 2020, and Arrow and both subsidiary banks have opted out of utilizing the CBLR framework. Therefore, the Capital Rules promulgated under Dodd-Frank will remain applicable to Arrow.
Total stockholders' equity was $334.4 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $32.7 million, or 10.8%, from the year earlier level. The components of the change in stockholders' equity since year-end 2018 are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity on page 62. Total book value per share increased by 10.3% over the prior year level. At December 31, 2020, tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure calculated based on tangible book value (total stockholders' equity minus intangible assets including goodwill) was $20.02, an increase of $2.01, or 11.2%, over the December 31, 2019 amount. The increase in total stockholders' equity during 2020 principally reflected the following factors: $40.83 million of net income for the year, plus $1.81 million of equity related to various stock-based compensation plans, plus $1.81 million of equity resulting from the dividend reinvestment plan, plus other comprehensive income of $5.54 million reduced by cash dividends of $15.74 million and the repurchases of common stock of $1.58 million. As of December 31, 2020, Arrow's closing stock price was $29.91, resulting in a trading multiple of 1.49 to Arrow's tangible book value. The Board of Directors declared and the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.252 per share for the first three quarters of 2020, as adjusted for a 3% stock dividend distributed September 25, 2020, a cash dividend of $0.26 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, and has declared a $0.26 per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2021.
Loan quality: Nonperforming loans were $6.4 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.0 million, or 45.6%, from year-end 2019. The ratio of nonperforming loans to period-end loans at December 31, 2020 was 0.25%, an increase from 0.18% at December 31, 2019 and less than the Company's peer group ratio of 0.64% at September 30, 2020. Loans charged-off (net of recoveries) against the allowance for loan losses was $1.3 million for 2020, an increase of $186 thousand from 2019. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.05% for 2020 and 2019, compared to the peer group ratio of 0.10% for the period ended September 30, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses was $29.2 million, representing 1.13% of total loans, an increase of 24 basis points from the December 31, 2019 ratio. Although credit quality remains strong, the increase in loan loss provision expense reflects the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Arrow adopted the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") accounting standard as of January 1, 2021.
Loan Segments: As of December 31, 2020, total loans grew $208.9 million, or 8.8%, as compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. The largest increase was in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which increased by $151.1 million or 22.9%, from December 31, 2019. The majority of the increase in commercial loans resulted from the origination of PPP loans, of which $114.6 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2020. The residential real estate loan portfolio increased $9.2 million, or 1.0%. The increase in the real estate loan portfolio is net of approximately $83.9 million of loans sold in 2020. In addition, consumer loans expanded $48.6 million, or 6.0%. The economic factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to restrictions on non-essential businesses, will most likely adversely impact loan growth for all or a portion of 2021.
◦ Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans: Combined, these loans comprise 31.3% of the total loan portfolio at period-end. Commercial property values in the Company’s region have largely remained stable in 2020, however, there remains uncertainty surrounding market conditions due to the pandemic. Appraisals on nonperforming and watched CRE loan properties are updated as deemed necessary, usually when the loan is downgraded or when there has been significant market deterioration since the last appraisal. The temporary closure of nonessential business in New York impacted, and may continue to impact, Arrow's customer base. Government intervention, with programs such as the PPP, may mitigate the economic risk to both Arrow and its customers, however the full impact cannot be determined at this time.
◦ Consumer Loans: These loans (primarily automobile loans) comprised approximately 33.1% of the total loan portfolio at period-end. Consumer automobile loans at December 31, 2020, were $854.7 million, or 99.4% of this portfolio segment. In 2020, Arrow did not experience any significant increase in the delinquency rate or in the percentage of nonperforming loans in this segment. The vast majority of automobile loans are initiated through the purchase of vehicles by consumers with automobile dealers. As of December 31, 2020, the physical sale of vehicles through dealerships is occurring, however, it had been curtailed for a portion of 2020 as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York and Vermont, our primary dealer network.
◦ Residential Real Estate Loans: These loans, including home equity loans, made up 35.6% of the total loan portfolio at period-end. The residential real estate market in the Company's service area has been stable in recent periods. Arrow originated nearly all of the residential real estate loans currently held in the loan portfolio and applies conservative underwriting standards to loan originations. Arrow typically sells a portion of residential real estate mortgage originations into the secondary market. The ratio of the sales of originations to total originations tends to fluctuate from period to period based on market conditions and other factors. Sales increased in 2020, due to a variety of factors, including strong demand for residential mortgages in our operating markets, favorable market conditions for mortgage sales and strategic balance sheet and interest-rate risk management decisions. The rate at which mortgage loan originations are sold in future periods will depend on various circumstances, including prevailing mortgage rates, other lending opportunities, capital and liquidity needs, and the availability of a market for such transactions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not yet possible to determine the long term economic impact on our residential real estate loan portfolio. It should be noted, however, that historically low interest rates led to higher originations in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Liquidity and access to credit markets: Arrow did not experience any liquidity problems or special concerns in recent years or in 2020. Arrow’s liquidity position provides the necessary flexibility to address any unexpected near-term disruptions that may develop as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic such as: reduced cash-flows from the investment and loan portfolios and aggressive funding of programs associated with response efforts. Interest-bearing cash balances at December 31, 2020 were $338.9 million compared to $23.2 million at December 31, 2019. Operating collateralized lines of credit are established and available through the FHLBNY and FRB, totaling $1.5 billion. The terms of Arrow's lines of credit have not changed significantly in recent periods (see the general liquidity discussion on page 48). To address liquidity needs beyond maintaining and growing core deposit balances, Arrow has principally relied on asset-based liquidity (i.e., funds in overnight investments and cash flow from maturing investments and loans) with liability-based liquidity as a secondary source of funds (the main liability-based sources are an overnight borrowing arrangement with correspondent banks, an arrangement for overnight borrowing and term credit advances from the FHLBNY, and an additional arrangement for short-term advances at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window). Regular liquidity stress tests and tests of the contingent liquidity plan are performed to ensure that an adequate amount of available funds can be generated to meet a wide variety of potential liquidity crises including the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Visa Class B Common Stock: Arrow's subsidiary bank, Glens Falls National, like other Visa member banks, bears some indirect contingent liability for Visa's direct liability arising out of certain antitrust claims involving merchant discounts to the extent that Visa's liability might exceed the amount funded in its litigation escrow account. On December 13, 2019 the Court granted final approval to a settlement in this class action lawsuit. But, on January 3, 2020 an appeal of the final-approved order was filed
with the court. It is unknown how long the appeals process will take. When the appeals process is resolved and assuming the balance in the litigation escrow account is sufficient to cover the litigation claims and related expenses, Arrow could potentially realize a gain on the receipt of Visa Class A common stock. At December 31, 2020, Glens Falls National held 27,771 shares of Visa Class B common stock, and utilizing the conversion ratio to Class A common stock at that time, these Class B shares would convert to 45,000 shares of Visa Class A common stock. Since the litigation settlement is not certain, the Company has not recognized any economic value for these shares.
B. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following analysis of net interest income, the provision for loan losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense and income taxes, highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on the results of operations for December 31, 2020 and the prior two years. For a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, see Part II. Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
I. NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income represents the difference between interest, dividends and fees earned on loans, securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds. Changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds (volume) and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid (rate). Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets. Net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin.

Arrow's earnings are derived predominantly from net interest income, which is interest income, net of interest expense. Changes in balance sheet composition, including interest-earning assets, deposits, and borrowings, combined with changes in market interest rates, impact net interest income. Net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Interest-earning assets and funding sources are managed, including noninterest and interest-bearing liabilities, in order to maximize this margin.
2020 Compared to 2019: Net interest income increased $11.2 million, or 12.7%, to $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as the positive impact of continued balance sheet growth outweighed the negative impact of a tighter net interest margin. The net interest margin was 2.99% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 3.05% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net interest margin from the prior year was due to a variety of factors, including historically low interest rates and increased cash balances.
Interest income on investment securities and interest-bearing deposits at banks (cash) decreased $2.9 million, or 20.2%, between the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Cash balances increased sharply for the year, by $169.0 million, but the average rate paid on excess cash balances fell by 253 basis points as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near-zero in March 2020. Average balances on investment securities were higher for the year, but portfolio yields were lower, with fully taxable securities falling by 69 basis points and securities exempt from federal taxes falling by 12 basis points.
Interest income from loans increased $5.0 million, or 5.3%, to $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $95.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Although the Loan portfolio yield dropped by 0.20% in 2020, to 3.98%, continued loan growth pushed interest income higher. Average loan balances increased by $243.1 million, a 10.6% increase over 2019 average balances. Within the loan portfolio, the three principal segments are residential real estate loans, consumer loans
(primarily through the indirect automobile lending program) and commercial loans. The largest increase was in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which increased by $151.1 million or 22.9%, from December 31, 2019. The majority of the increase in commercial loans resulted from the origination of PPP loans, of which $114.6 million remain at December 31, 2020. The residential real estate loan portfolio increased $9.2 million, or 1.0%. The increase in the real estate loan portfolio is net of approximately $83.9 million of loans sold in 2020. In 2020, Arrow originated a higher volume of residential mortgages than in the previous year, and sold a larger volume of these loans to the secondary market. In addition, consumer loans expanded $48.6 million, or 6.0%, reflecting continuing strong automobile sales.
Total interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities decreased $9.0 million, or 41.5%, to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Although average interest bearing deposit balances increased by $383.6 million, the total cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased by 0.38% to 0.51%. In addition, average demand deposits, which are non-interest bearing, increased by $140.9 million. Total deposit growth outpaced loan growth in 2020. As a result, excess deposit balances were utilized to pay-down borrowings, and average borrowings decreased by $133.3 million.
II. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
Arrow considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy, given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and the material effect that such judgments may have on the results of operations. The provision for loan losses for 2020 was $9.3 million, compared to the $2.1 million provision for 2019. The increase in the allowance reflects loan growth and the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the method employed for determining the amount of the loan loss provision is explained in detail in Notes 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and 5, Loans, to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The allowance for loan losses increased to $29.2 million at year-end 2020 from $21.2 million at year-end 2019, an increase of 38.0%. A variety of factors were considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 and the provision for loan losses for the year. See Note 5, Loans, to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete list of all the factors used to calculate the provision for loan losses, including the factors that did not change during the year. Most of the adversely classified loans (special mention and substandard - see the definition for these classifications in Note 5, Loans, to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) continued to perform under their contractual terms.
III. NONINTEREST INCOME
The majority of the noninterest income constitutes fee income from services, principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services, deposit account service charges, insurance commissions, net gains (losses) on securities transactions, net gains on sales of loans and other recurring fee income.

Total Noninterest Income $ 32,658 $ 28,555 $ 28,949 $ 4,103 14.4 % $ (394) (1.4) %
2020 Compared to 2019: Total noninterest income in 2020 was $32.7 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 14.4%, from total noninterest income of $28.6 million for 2019. Income from fiduciary activities increased slightly from 2019 to 2020. Assets under trust administration and investment management at December 31, 2020 were $1.66 billion, an increase of $115.4 million, or 7.5%, from the prior year-end balance of $1.54 billion.
Fees for other services to customers (primarily service charges on deposit accounts, income from debit card transactions, and servicing income on sold loans) were $10.0 million for 2020, decreased slightly as compared to 2019, mostly the result of a decline in overdraft charges.
Insurance commissions decreased by $306 thousand, or 4.3% from 2019 to 2020. The reduction in commissions is due in large part to continued increased competition. Arrow has enacted expense control initiatives related to the insurance business to ensure expenses appropriately correspond to the decreased revenue.
Net loss on securities in 2020 consisted of a change in the fair value of equity investments of $427 thousand and a realized loss of $37 thousand on the sale of securities.
Net gains on the sales of loans increased in 2020 to $3.9 million, from $622 thousand in 2019, an increase of $3.3 million, or 525.2%. Sales increased due to a variety of factors, including strong demand for residential mortgages in our operating markets, favorable market conditions for mortgage sales and strategic balance sheet and interest-rate risk management decisions. The rate at which mortgage loan originations are sold in future periods will depend on various circumstances, including prevailing mortgage rates, other lending opportunities, capital and liquidity needs, and the availability of a market for such transactions. Therefore, Arrow is unable to predict what the retention rate of such loans in future periods may be. Servicing rights are generally retained for loans originated and sold, which also generates additional noninterest income in subsequent periods (fees for other services to customers).
Other operating income increased by $2.0 million, or 134.5% between the two years due to a variety of factors. In 2020, Arrow had a gain on the sale of OREO properties of $192.0 thousand compared to a loss of the sale of OREO properties in 2019 of $242.1 thousand. Fees received as part of interest rate swap agreements increased $781.4 thousand. Arrow purchased additional bank owned life insurance in 2020 which generated an increase in income of $130.6 thousand from the prior year. In 2020, Arrow had a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $16.5 thousand compared to charges related to the disposal of fixed assets of $559.5 thousand in 2019.
IV. NONINTEREST EXPENSE
Noninterest expense is the measure of the delivery cost of services, products and business activities of a company. The key components of noninterest expense are presented in the following table.

Efficiency Ratio 55.69 % 57.09 % 56.60 % (1.40) % (2.5) % 0.49 % 0.9 %
2020 compared to 2019: Noninterest expense for 2020 amounted to $70.7 million, an increase of $3.2 million, or 4.8%, from 2019. For 2020, the efficiency ratio was 55.69%. This ratio, which is a commonly used non-GAAP financial measure in the banking industry, is a comparative measure of a financial institution's operating efficiency. The efficiency ratio (a ratio where lower is better), as defined by Arrow, is the ratio of operating noninterest expense (excluding intangible asset amortization) to net interest income (on a tax-equivalent basis) plus operating noninterest income (excluding net securities gains or losses). See the discussion of the efficiency ratio on page 4 of this Report under the heading “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Salaries and employee benefits expense, which typically represents between 55% and 60% of total noninterest expense, increased $3.7 million or 9.5%, from 2019. A significant portion of the increase, $1.3 million, was the result of a decrease in the reclassification out of salaries and employee benefits into other operating expenses. Under ASU 2017-07, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost and amortization of net loss are required to be reclassified out of salaries and employee benefits. The reclassification is also a factor contributing to the decrease in other operating expense between 2020 and 2019. Salaries and benefits were also impacted by increased overtime, benefit costs, incentive payments and a recognition bonus that was paid to most employees in 2020. Many of these costs were related to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the required response needed to address customer needs.
FDIC assessment increased $906 thousand or 577.1%, from 2019 as the result of the increased assets of Arrow's subsidiaries.
Other operating expense decreased $1.4 million, or (14.2)%, from 2019. In addition to the reclassification described above, the remaining decrease was primarily related to travel, supplies and advertising.
V. INCOME TAXES

The provisions for federal and state income taxes amounted to $11.0 million for 2020, $9.6 million for 2019, and $9.0 million for 2018. The effective income tax rates for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 21.3%, 20.4% and 19.9%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 over 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to the reduction of tax exempt investments held and the related investment income.
C. FINANCIAL CONDITION
I. INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Beginning January 1, 2018, upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01, equity securities with readily determined fair values are stated at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and losses reported in income. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, Arrow held no trading securities.
The available-for-sale securities portfolio, held-to-maturity securities portfolio and the equity securities portfolio are further detailed below.
Securities Available-for-Sale:
The following table sets forth the carrying value of the securities available-for-sale portfolio at year-end December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Corporate and Other Debt Securities 800 800 800
Total $ 365,287 $ 357,334 $ 317,535
In the periods above, Arrow held no investment securities in the securities portfolio that consisted of or included, directly or indirectly, obligations of foreign governments or government agencies of foreign issuers.
In the periods referenced above, Mortgage-Backed Securities consisted solely of mortgage pass-through securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations ("CMOs") issued or guaranteed by U.S. federal agencies. Mortgage pass-through securities provide to the investor monthly portions of principal and interest pursuant to the contractual obligations of the underlying mortgages. CMOs are pools of mortgages, the repayments on which have generally been separated into two or more components (tranches), where each tranche has a separate estimated life and yield. Arrow's practice has been to purchase pass-through securities and CMOs that are issued or guaranteed by U.S. federal agencies, and the tranches of CMOs purchased are generally those having shorter average lives and/or durations. As a result of payment deferrals on underlying loan collateral that make up mortgage-backed securities, some cashflows may be temporarily impacted.
The following table sets forth the maturities of the debt securities in the available-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2020. CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities are included in the table based on their expected average lives.

The yields on obligations of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were computed on a tax-equivalent basis. The yields on other debt securities shown in the table above are calculated by dividing annual interest, including accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, by the amortized cost of the securities at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted average maturity was 2.3 and 4.2 years, respectively, for debt securities in the available-for-sale portfolio.
At December 31, 2020, the net unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale amounted to $7.8 million. The net unrealized gain or loss on such securities, net of tax, is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. The net unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale was $0.6 million at December 31, 2019. For both periods, net unrealized gains were primarily attributable to changes in market rates between the date of purchase and the balance sheet date resulting in higher or lower valuations of the portfolio securities.

Maintenance of High Quality in the Loan Portfolio: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no significant fluctuations in the quality of the loan portfolio or any segment thereof. In general, residential real estate loans have historically been underwritten to secondary market standards for prime loans and Arrow has not engaged in subprime mortgage lending as a business line. Similarly, high underwriting standards have generally been applied to commercial and commercial real estate lending operations and generally in the indirect lending program as well. The economic events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically elevated unemployment and the temporary mandated closure of nonessential business, may impact the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations.
Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans: Over the last three years, commercial and commercial real estate loans have continued to grow. Outstanding balances have increased by $151.1 million, $39.7 million and $48.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans in the loan portfolio were extended to businesses or borrowers located in the Company's regional markets. A portion of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to Prime, LIBOR or FHLBNY rates.
Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans are in industries that have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Arrow originated over 1,400 PPP loans totaling approximately $142.7 million. The PPP loans have an interest rate of 1% and Arrow expects to earn approximately $5.6 million in fees related to the origination of these loans. The original term on the PPP loans is two years, however the borrower will have the option to apply for forgiveness. Subsequent to the funding of certain PPP loans, additional guidance was provided permitting the term of a PPP loan to be extended to five years if both parties agree to the revised terms. Arrow is recognizing the fees earned over the life of the loan and will accelerate recognition of the fees if the loan is forgiven by the Small Business Administration. Additional government intervention, if any, may mitigate the economic risk to both Arrow and its customers, however, the extent of such intervention and its impact cannot be determined at this time.
Consumer Loans: At December 31, 2020, consumer loans (primarily automobile loans originated through dealerships located primarily in upstate New York and Vermont) represented 33% of loans in the loan portfolio, and continue to be a significant component of the Company's business.
Consumer loan originations have remained strong in 2020, with origination volume for the last three years at $386.4 million, $407.4 million and $391.6 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The physical sale of vehicles through dealerships had been curtailed for a portion of the year as part of the New York State and Vermont response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we believe, the volume of originations of consumer loans have been impacted. However, the magnitude of the impact cannot be determined.
For credit quality purposes, Arrow assigns potential automobile loan customers into one of four tiers, ranging from lower to higher quality in terms of anticipated credit risk. Arrow's experienced lending staff not only utilizes credit evaluation software tools but also reviews and evaluates each loan individually prior to the loan being funded. Arrow believes that this disciplined approach to evaluating risk has contributed to maintaining the strong credit quality in this portfolio. The COVID-19 pandemic has created elevated unemployment, which may impact borrowers' ability to satisfy their obligations to Arrow. Government intervention may mitigate a significant portion of the credit risk, however, the extent of such intervention and its impact cannot be determined at this time.
Residential Real Estate Loans: In recent years, residential real estate and home equity loans have represented the largest single segment of the loan portfolio (comprising approximately 36% of the entire portfolio at December 31, 2020), slightly higher than the consumer loan portfolio (33% of the portfolio) and the commercial and commercial real estate loans (31%). Gross originations for residential real estate loans (including refinancings of mortgage loans) were $250.1 million, $164.7 million and $142.9 million for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
During each of these years, gross origination totals have significantly exceeded the sum of repayments and prepayments of such loans previously in the portfolio. Arrow may sell portions of these originations in the secondary market, primarily to Freddie Mac. Sales amounted to $83.9 million, or 43.7%, of the total loans originated in 2020. The increase from previous years was due to a variety of factors, including strong demand for residential mortgages in our operating markets, favorable market
conditions for mortgage sales and strategic balance sheet and interest-rate risk management decisions. Sales of originations amounted to $24.5 million for 2019 and $4.3 million for 2018 which represented 16.9% and 3.3%, respectively of the gross originations for those years.
Arrow expects to continue to sell a portion of mortgage loan originations in upcoming periods if market conditions and strategic balance sheet and interest-rate risk management decisions warrant. It is not currently possible to determine the long term economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had resulted in the temporary closure of non-essential business and elevated unemployment.
The following table indicates the changing mix in the loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for the significant loan segments for the past five quarters. The remaining quarter-by-quarter tables present the percentage of total loans represented by each category and the annualized yield of each category.

The average yield on the loan portfolio decreased from 4.19% for the fourth quarter of 2019 to 3.94% for the fourth quarter of 2020. Market rates declined in 2020, which impacted the new loan yields for fixed rate loans, and variable loan yields as these loans reached their repricing dates. Commercial loan yields were affected by the $142.7 million of PPP loans originated in 2020. Commercial loan yields rose in the 4th quarter due to fees from the Small Business Administration being recognized in full for the $24.8 million loans forgiven in the 4th quarter. Residential real estate yields declined each quarter of 2020 consistent with overall market behavior as well as the effect of variable home equity loans.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created economic uncertainty resulting in elevated unemployment as well as the temporary closure of nonessential businesses. In the table below, loans deferred by industry sector as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented and compared to total loans by sector as of December 31, 2020. In accordance with the CARES Act, the deferrals listed below are not considered troubled debt restructurings. In 2020, Arrow originated $142.7 million of PPP loans. These loans are included in the loan balances by sector as listed below, however, these loans are not considered deferred as of December 31, 2020.

PPP Loans
Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans are in industries that have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Arrow originated over 1,400 PPP loans totaling $142.7 million. The PPP loans have an interest rate of 1% and Arrow expects to earn approximately $5.6 million in fees related to the origination of these loans. The original term on the PPP loans is two years, however the borrower will have the option to apply for forgiveness. Subsequent to the funding of the loans, additional guidance was provided that the term of the loan may be extended to five years if both parties agree to the revised terms. Arrow will recognize the fees earned over the life of the loan and will accelerate recognition of the fees if the loan is forgiven by the Small Business Administration. Arrow expects to fund additional PPP loans in early 2021, subject to the availability of government programs and the needs of the communities Arrow serves.

The following table indicates the respective maturities and interest rate structure of commercial loans and commercial real estate construction loans at December 31, 2020. For purposes of determining relevant maturities, loans are assumed to mature at (but not before) their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms. Demand loans and overdrafts are included in the “Within 1 Year” maturity category. Most of the commercial construction loans are made with a commitment for permanent financing, whether extended by us or unrelated third parties. The maturity distribution below reflects the final maturity of the permanent financing.

COMMITMENTS AND LINES OF CREDIT
Stand-by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business, which are not reflected in the financial statements at a given date because the commitments are not funded at that time. As of December 31, 2020, the total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to $3.7 million. In addition to these instruments, there are lines of credit to customers, including home equity lines of credit, commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit, which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time-to-time. Commercial lines, generally issued for a period of one year, are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower. At December 31, 2020, outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount were approximately $399.9 million.
c. Risk Elements
1. Nonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans
The amounts of nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans at year-end for each of the past five years are presented in the table on page 36 under the heading "Summary of the Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses."
Loans are placed on nonaccrual status either due to the delinquency status of principal and/or interest or a judgment by management that the full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely. Unless already placed on nonaccrual status, loans secured by home equity lines of credit are put on nonaccrual status when 120 days past due and residential real estate loans are put on nonaccrual status when 150 days past due. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are evaluated on a loan-by-loan basis and are placed on nonaccrual status when 90 days past due if the full collection of principal and interest is uncertain. Under the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy established by banking regulators, fixed-maturity consumer loans not secured by real estate must generally be charged-off no later than when 120 days past due. Loans secured with non-real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged-down to the value of the collateral, less cost to sell. Arrow had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are those loans which were contractually past due 90 days or more but because of expected repayments, were still accruing interest.
The balance of loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing interest totaled $9.2 million at December 31, 2020 and represented 0.35% of loans outstanding at that date, as compared to approximately $10.7 million, or 0.45% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2019. These non-current loans at December 31, 2020 were composed of approximately $7.7 million of consumer loans (principally indirect automobile loans), $1.3 million of residential real estate loans and $0.2 million of commercial and commercial real estate loans.
Arrow evaluates nonaccrual loans over $250 thousand and all troubled debt restructured loans individually for impairment. All impaired loans are measured based on either (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, (ii) the loan's observable market price or (iii) the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Arrow determines impairment for collateralized loans based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell. For other impaired loans, impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. Arrow determines the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan-by-loan basis. Based upon the borrowers' payment histories and cash flow projections, interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis. The method for measuring all other loans is described in detail in Notes 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and 5, Loans, to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 5, Loans, to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains detailed information on modified loans and impaired loans.
2. Potential Problem Loans
On at least a quarterly basis, the internal credit quality rating is re-evaluated for commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect well-defined weaknesses. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts, even if such loans are not past due.
Periodically, Arrow reviews the loan portfolio for evidence of potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms, but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower may jeopardize loan repayment and result in a non-performing loan. In the credit monitoring program, Arrow treats loans that are classified as substandard but continue to accrue interest as potential problem loans. At December 31, 2020, Arrow identified 47 commercial loans totaling $38.1 million as potential problem loans. At December 31, 2019, Arrow identified 54 commercial loans totaling $32.0 million as potential problem loans. For these loans, although positive factors such as payment history, value of supporting collateral, and/or personal or government guarantees led Arrow to conclude that accounting for them as non-performing at year-end was not warranted, other factors, specifically, certain risk factors related to the loan or the borrower justified concerns that they may become nonperforming at some point in the future.
The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically unemployment levels and the temporary mandated closure of nonessential businesses, may impact borrowers' ability to satisfy their obligations, and may therefore result in increased delinquencies. Government interventions, on both the federal and state level, have been deployed to mitigate a significant portion of the credit risk. Arrow cannot make a determination as to the overall impact on its business of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time.
3. Foreign Outstandings - None
4. Loan Concentrations
The loan portfolio is well diversified. There are no concentrations of credit that exceed 10% of the portfolio, other than the general categories reported in the preceding Section C.II.a. of this Item 7, beginning on page 42. For further discussion, see Note 1, Risks and Uncertainties, to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
5. Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets
Other real estate owned ("OREO") primarily consists of real property acquired in foreclosure. OREO is carried at fair value less estimated cost to sell. Arrow establishes allowances for OREO losses, which are determined and monitored on a property-by-property basis and reflect the ongoing estimate of the property's estimated fair value less costs to sell. All Repossessed Assets for each of the five years in the table below consist of motor vehicles.

Average total deposit balances increased by $524.5 million, or 21.3% in 2020, mainly in the demand deposit and savings deposit categories.
Arrow used reciprocal deposits for a select group of municipalities to reduce the amount of investment securities required to be pledged as collateral for municipal deposits where municipal deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance coverage limits were transferred to other participating banks, divided into portions so as to qualify such transferred deposits for FDIC insurance coverage at each transferee bank. In return, reciprocal amounts are transferred to Arrow in equal amounts of deposits from the participant banks. The balances of reciprocal deposits were $404.2 million and $256.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters.

The quarterly average balances of both noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing checking and savings accounts have increased significantly in the last three quarters. Time deposits, over $250,000 as well as other time deposits, have decreased over the last three quarters, including $80.6 million of brokered deposits that matured. Market rates, which began to decline prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, reached historic lows in the first quarter and have remained low for the remainder of 2020. Short term interest rates, heavily impacted by Federal Reserve monetary policy, are not expected to change for an extended period.
In general, there is a seasonal pattern to municipal deposits which dip to a low point in August each year. Account balances tend to increase throughout the fall and into early winter from tax deposits, flatten out after the beginning of the ensuing calendar year, and increase again at the end of March from the electronic deposit of NYS Aid payments to school districts. In addition to seasonal behavior, the overall level of municipal deposit balances fluctuates from year-to-year as a result of local economic factors as well as competition from other banks and non-bank entities.
The total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below.

Throughout 2020, the total cost of deposits continued to decrease. The Federal Reserve lowered the Fed Funds target rate to 0.00%-0.25% in response to the economic disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Arrow's balance sheet is well positioned for a variety of rate environments.

D. LIQUIDITY
The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the Company has the ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost. This includes the capability of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to Arrow's customers at any time. Given the uncertain nature of customer demands and the need to maximize earnings, Arrow must have available reasonably priced sources of funds, both on- and off-balance sheet, that can be accessed quickly in time of need. With the COVID-19
pandemic, liquidity management is critical for Arrow. Arrow’s liquidity position provides the necessary flexibility to address any unexpected near-term disruptions that may develop as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic such as: reduced cash-flows from the investment and loan portfolios and aggressive funding of programs associated with response efforts.
Arrow's primary sources of available liquidity are overnight investments in federal funds sold, interest bearing bank balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and cash flow from investment securities and loans. Certain investment securities are categorized as available-for-sale at time of purchase based on their marketability and collateral value, as well as their yield and maturity. The securities available-for-sale portfolio was $365.3 million at year-end 2020, an increase of $8.0 million from the year-end 2019 level. Due to the potential for volatility in market values, Arrow may not always be able to sell securities on short notice at their carrying value, even to provide needed liquidity. Arrow also held interest-bearing cash balances at December 31, 2020 of $338.9 million compared to $23.2 million at December 31, 2019.
In addition to liquidity from cash, short-term investments, investment securities and loans, the Company has supplemented available operating liquidity with additional off-balance sheet sources such as a federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks and credit lines with the FHLBNY. The federal funds lines of credit are with two correspondent banks totaling $52 million which were not drawn on in 2020.
To support the borrowing relationship with the FHLBNY, Arrow has pledged collateral, including residential mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2020, Arrow had outstanding collateralized obligations with the FHLBNY of $45 million; as of that date, the unused borrowing capacity at the FHLBNY was approximately $814 million. Brokered deposits have also been identified as an available source of funding accessible in a relatively short time period. At December 31, 2020, the balance of outstanding brokered deposits totaled $47.5 million. Also, Arrow's two bank subsidiaries have each established a borrowing facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential "discount window" advances, which are maintained for contingency liquidity purposes. At December 31, 2020, the amount available under this facility was approximately $610 million in the aggregate, and there were no advances then outstanding.
Arrow performs regular liquidity stress tests and tests of the contingent liquidity plan to ensure that an adequate amount of available funds can be generated to meet a wide variety of potential liquidity crises including the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Arrow measures and monitors basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to total short-term liabilities, both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements. Based on the level of overnight funds investments, available liquidity from the investment securities portfolio, cash flows from the loan portfolio, the stable core deposit base and the significant borrowing capacity, the Company believes that the available liquidity is sufficient to meet all funding needs that may arise in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or any other reasonably likely events or occurrences, although there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient. At December 31, 2020, Arrow's basic liquidity ratio, including FHLBNY collateralized borrowing capacity, was 32.1% of total assets, or $1.04 billion in excess of Arrow's internally-set minimum target ratio of 4%.
Arrow did not experience any liquidity constraints in 2020 and did not experience any such constraints in recent prior years. Arrow has not at any time during such period been forced to pay above-market rates to obtain retail deposits or other funds from any source.
E. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND DIVIDENDS
Important Regulatory Capital Standards: Dodd-Frank, enacted in 2010, directed U.S. bank regulators to promulgate revised bank organization capital standards, which were required to be at least as strict as the regulatory capital standards for banks then in effect. The Capital Rules under Dodd-Frank were adopted by the Federal bank regulatory agencies in 2013 and became effective for Arrow and its subsidiary banks on January 1, 2015. These Capital Rules are summarized in an earlier section of this Report, "Regulatory Capital Standards," beginning on page 7.
The table below sets forth the various capital ratios achieved by Arrow and its subsidiary banks, Glens Falls National and Saratoga National, as of December 31, 2020, as determined under the bank regulatory capital standards in effect on that date, as well as the minimum levels for such capital ratios that bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain under the Capital Rules (not including the "capital conservation buffer"). As demonstrated in the table, all of Arrow's and the banks' capital ratios at year-end were well in excess of the minimum required levels for such ratios, as established by the regulators. (See Item 1, Section C, under "Regulatory Capital Standards" and Item 8, Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding the "capital conservation buffer.") In addition, on December 31, 2020, Arrow and each of the banks qualified as "well-capitalized", the highest capital classification category under the revised capital classification scheme recently established by the federal bank regulators, that was in effect on that date.
Capital Ratios:
Arrow GFNB SNB Minimum
Required
Ratio
Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 9.1% 8.7% 8.9% 4.0%
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.4% 13.9% 13.0% 4.5%
Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio 14.2% 13.9% 13.0% 6.0%
Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio 15.5% 15.2% 14.2% 8.0%
As reported in the Regulatory Reform section above, the federal bank regulators have issued a final rule to implement the Community Bank Leverage Ratio ("CBLR"), introducing an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banks that satisfy certain requirements, including having a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, less than $10 billion in
total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community bank that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the CBLR framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the “prompt corrective action” regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital ratios. The CBLR is calculated as the ratio of “tier 1 capital” divided by “average total consolidated assets.” This final rule was effective as of January 1, 2020, and qualifying community banks can utilize the CBLR framework for purposes of filing their call reports or Form FR Y-9C, as applicable, for the first quarter of 2020 (i.e., as of March 31, 2020). Arrow elected to opt out of utilizing the CBLR framework. The Capital Rules promulgated under Dodd-Frank will remain applicable to Arrow.
Stockholders' Equity at Year-end 2020: Total stockholders' equity was $334.4 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $32.7 million, or 10.8%, from the year earlier level. The increase in total stockholders' equity during 2020 principally reflected the following factors: $40.83 million of net income for the year, plus $1.81 million of equity related to various stock-based compensation plans, plus $1.81 million of equity resulting from the dividend reinvestment plan, plus other comprehensive income of $5.54 million reduced by cash dividends of $15.74 million and the repurchases of common stock of $1.58 million.
Trust Preferred Securities: In each of 2003 and 2004, Arrow issued $10 million of trust preferred securities (TRUPs) in a private placement. Under the Federal Reserve Board's regulatory capital rules then in effect, TRUPs proceeds typically qualified as Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies such as Arrow, but only in amounts up to 25% of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, any trust preferred securities that Arrow might issue on or after the grandfathering date set forth in Dodd-Frank (May 19, 2010) would not qualify as Tier 1 capital under bank regulatory capital guidelines. For Arrow, TRUPs outstanding prior to the grandfathering cutoff date set forth in Dodd-Frank (May 19, 2010) would continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital until maturity or redemption, subject to limitations. Thus, Arrow's outstanding TRUPs continue to qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital, subject to such limitations.
In the first quarter of 2020, Arrow entered into two interest rate swap agreements to synthetically fix the variable rate interest payments associated with $20 million in outstanding subordinated trust securities. The effective fixed rate is 3.43% until maturity. These agreements are designated as cash flow hedges.
Dividends: The source of funds for the payment by Arrow of cash dividends to stockholders consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to it by its bank subsidiaries. In addition to legal and regulatory limitations on payments of dividends by Arrow (i.e., the need to maintain adequate regulatory capital), there are also legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the bank subsidiaries to Arrow. As of December 31, 2020, under the statutory limitations in national banking law, the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to Arrow, without special regulatory approval, was approximately $71.8 million The ability of Arrow and its banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies, capital guidelines and applicable laws.
See Part II, Item 5, "Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for a recent history of its cash dividend payments.
Stock Repurchase Program: In October 2019, the Board of Directors approved a $5.0 million stock repurchase program. effective January 1, 2020 (the 2020 program), under which management was authorized, in its discretion, to cause Arrow to repurchase up to $5 million of shares of Arrow's common stock during 2020, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, to the extent management believed the Company's stock was reasonably priced and such repurchases appeared to be an attractive use of available capital and in the best interests of its shareholders. This 2020 program replaced a similar repurchase program which was in effect over the period from January 30, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (the 2019 program), which also authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 million of shares of Arrow's common stock. As of December 31, 2020 approximately $1.5 million had been used under the 2020 program to repurchase Arrow shares. This total does not include approximately $1.6 million of Arrow's Common Stock that the Company repurchased during 2020 other than through its repurchase program, i.e., repurchases of Arrow shares on the market utilizing funds accumulated under Arrow's Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the surrender or deemed surrender of Arrow stock to the Company in connection with employees' stock-for-stock exercises of compensatory stock options to buy Arrow stock. The 2020 program expired on December 31, 2020. A similar 2021 program, allowing for stock repurchases of up to $5 million over the period of January 27, 2021 through December 31, 2021, was approved by the Board of Directors in January 2021.
F. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of operations, Arrow may engage in a variety of financial transactions or arrangements, including derivative transactions or arrangements, that in accordance with GAAP are not recorded in the financial statements, or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. These transactions or arrangements involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. Such transactions or arrangements may be used by Arrow or Arrow's customers for general corporate purposes, such as managing credit, interest rate, or liquidity risk or to optimize capital, or may be used by Arrow or Arrow's customers to manage funding needs.
In 2020 and 2019, Arrow entered into interest rate swap agreements with its commercial customers to provide them with a long-term fixed rate, while simultaneously Arrow entered into offsetting interest rate swap agreements with a counterparty to swap the fixed rate to a variable rate to manage interest rate exposure. In the first quarter of 2020, Arrow entered into two interest rate swap agreements to synthetically fix the variable rate interest payments associated with $20 million in outstanding subordinated trust securities.
Arrow's commercial loan interest rate swap agreements are not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. The commercial loan interest rate swap agreements have substantially equivalent and offsetting terms, they do not present any material exposure to Arrow's consolidated statements of income. Arrow records its interest rate swap agreements at fair value and is presented on a gross basis within other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities arising from these derivatives are included, net, in other income in the consolidated statement of income.

H. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The following accounting standards have been issued and become effective for the Company at a future date:
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses" ("CECL") which will change the way financial entities measure expected credit losses for financial assets, primarily loans. Under this ASU, the "incurred loss" model will be replaced with an "expected loss" model which will recognize losses over the life of the instrument and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information. Currently, credit losses on available-for-sale securities reduce the carrying value of the instrument and cannot be reversed. Under CECL, the amount of the credit loss is carried as a valuation allowance and can be reversed. The standard also requires expanded credit quality disclosures. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04 "Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses; Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging; and Topic 825, Financial Instruments," which clarifies that the estimate of expected credit losses should include expected recoveries of financial assets, and that contractual extension or renewal options that are not unconditionally cancellable by the lender are considered when determining the contractual term over which expected credit losses are measured. The Company's loan terms for contractual extensions and renewal options are unconditionally cancellable by the Company (that is, the Company has no obligation to extend or renew existing loans), and therefore are not considered in measuring expected credit losses. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05 "Targeted Transition Relief," which allows entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost, not including held-to-maturity investment securities which will continue to be measured at amortized cost. This will apply to those institutions that elect the fair value option on newly originated or purchased financial assets, to avoid the possibility of dual measurement methodologies for identical or similar financial assets.
As permitted by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act, Arrow deferred the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") methodology in determining credit losses until January 1, 2021. The initial adjustment to the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments recorded as other liabilities was not reported in earnings, but as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and the adoption will require additional disclosures in future periods. To prepare for the adoption of CECL, (a) the Company held CECL working group meetings that included individuals from various functional areas relevant to the implementation of CECL; (b) the CECL working group developed accounting policies for credit losses including, among other things, management’s decisions regarding portfolio segmentation, life of loan considerations, and a reasonable and supportable forecasting methodology; (c) the Company established a CECL governance and approval process, and completed an analysis of the results from a third-party model validation and the results from an internal model validation; and (d) the Company established an internal control framework and finalized the testing of controls related to the adoption of CECL. The CECL pronouncement describes several acceptable methodologies for calculating expected losses on a loan or a pool of loans. Arrow identified the discounted cash flow method for determining losses for the commercial loan portfolios and the residential real estate portfolios, and the vintage method for the consumer indirect loan portfolio. As a result of analyses performed, including the availability of future economic data, the Company will utilize an 18-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, and revert to an historic net loss rate using the straight-line method over a two year reversion period. The Company has identified the economic data that it believes best correlate with expected credit losses through the use of various regression analyses of historical economic information and loan losses. The Company has developed a qualitative factor framework in accordance with this standard that has changed how qualitative factors are determined as compared to the current incurred loss allowance for loan losses model, and has developed a methodology to determine unfunded loan commitments that are recorded as other liabilities. The Company has continued to monitor updates to financial reporting requirements and regulatory guidance, and evaluated the impact on the consolidated financial statements, disclosures, processes and internal controls.
The Company has performed parallel CECL reserve estimated calculations for each quarterly period beginning December 31, 2019 and is completing its final review of the most recent model run including an evaluation of model back-testing and sensitivity analysis results and finalizing certain assumptions primarily related to qualitative factor adjustments. The Company does not expect to incur a material adjustment to the stockholders' equity balance as of January 1, 2021 related to the adoption of CECL for held-to-maturity securities, loans carried at amortized cost and unfunded commitments recorded as other liabilities. In addition, the Company has also evaluated the composition of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio and determined that the changes in ASU 2016-13 will not have a significant effect on the current portfolio.
With the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2021, Arrow expects to remain a well-capitalized financial institution. Regulators have developed a deferral option related to the adoption of CECL and the resulting computation of regulatory capital ratios, the 2019 CECL Rule, which allows a financial institution to elect a three year deferral of the initial CECL adoption amount for the computation of regulatory capital. Arrow is in the process of evaluating this deferral method.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 "Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes" (Topic 740), which removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Arrow adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position or the results of operations in periods subsequent to its adoption.
I. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Arrow reported net income of $12.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.8 million, or 28.3%, from the net income of $9.7 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $0.81, up from $0.63 during the fourth quarter of 2019. The net change in earnings between the two quarters was due to the following: (a) a $2.9 million increase in net interest income, (b) a $2.0 million increase in noninterest income, (c) a $602 thousand increase in the provision for loan losses, (d) a $1.1 million increase in noninterest expense, and (e) a $1.1 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The principal factors contributing to these quarter-to-quarter changes are included in the discussion of the year-to-year changes in net income set forth elsewhere in this Item 7, specifically, in Section B, "Results of Operations," above, as well as in Arrow's Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021, incorporating by reference Arrow's earnings release for the year ended December 31, 2020.
