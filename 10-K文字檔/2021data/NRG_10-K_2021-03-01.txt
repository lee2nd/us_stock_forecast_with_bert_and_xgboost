Executive Summary
NRG is an integrated power company built on dynamic retail brands with diverse generation assets. NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services in major competitive power and gas markets in the U.S. and Canada in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. As of December 31, 2020, the Company sold energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services directly to retail customers under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Green Mountain Energy, Stream, and XOOM Energy, as well as other brand names owned by NRG, supported by approximately 23,000 MW of generation.
For discussion of COVID-19 related considerations refer to Item 1 - Business.
Business Environment
The industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2020 and for the future medium term include:
Commodities Markets - The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2020, the average natural gas prices at Henry Hub was 21% lower than in 2019.
If long-term gas prices increase, the Company is likely to encounter higher realized energy prices, leading to higher energy revenues as lower priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with higher gas and power prices. This impact is partially offset by the retail operations, as NRG's retail gross margins have historically decreased as natural gas prices increase.
NRG's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline. This would be partially offset by lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices. To further mitigate this impact, NRG may increase its percentage of coal and nuclear capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading "Energy-Related Commodities" in Item 15 - Note 6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Natural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand. The low-priced commodity environment has stressed coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production. If multiple parties withdraw from the market, liquidity could be challenged in the short term. Inventory overhang will be utilized to offset production losses. Coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.
Electricity Prices - The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the Company's profitability. An increase in supply cost volatility in the competitive retail markets may result in smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. ERCOT power prices decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the lower power prices in summer and lower gas prices in the first half of the year. Power prices in the East and West/Other decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 due to lower prices associated with lower demand due to COVID-19.
(a) Average on-peak power prices based on real time settlement prices as published by the respective ISOs
(b) Average on-peak power prices based on day-ahead settlement prices as published by the respective ISOs
The following table summarizes average realized power prices for each region in which NRG operates, including the impact of settled hedges, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(a) Average Realized Power Price reflects energy sales from the generation fleet, omitting sales to the retail component of the East Segment. Intercompany financial transactions hedging generation with the retail operations make up $12.18/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2020 and $5.40/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2019.
The average realized power prices were relatively stable year over year due to the Company's hedging program.
Increased Awareness of, and Action to Combat, Climate Change - Diverse groups of stakeholders, including investors, asset managers, financial institutions, non-government organizations, industry coalitions, individual companies, consumer groups and academic institutions, are increasingly engaged in efforts to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to well below 2 degrees Celsius. As a result, policymakers and regulators at regional, national, sub-national and local levels of government, both in the United States and other parts of the world, are increasingly focused on actions to combat climate change.
In the United States, the current Administration has stated that limiting climate change is one of its top priorities. In its early days, the Administration issued an Executive Order on "Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad." This included commitments to reset the United States' greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the Paris Climate Agreement, integrate environmental justice considerations into all aspects of its climate and environmental policy, consider climate change and conservation in federal permitting decisions and align government procurement strategy and standards with climate goals.
To enable climate policy development and implementation, the Administration has pledged to adopt a "whole-of-government" approach and is establishing various new climate-oriented positions and working groups. For example, it created the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, led by the first-ever National Climate Advisor and Deputy National Climate Advisor, which will create a central office in the White House that is charged with coordinating and implementing the President's domestic climate agenda. The newly established National Climate Task Force will assemble representatives from across 21 federal agencies and departments. The Federal Reserve is creating a committee to deepen its understanding of the risks that climate change poses to the financial system. The SEC has created the new role of Senior Policy Advisor for Climate and Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") to oversee and coordinate the agency's efforts related to climate risk and other ESG developments, and to examine how these issues intersect with the regulatory framework across its offices and divisions. An interagency working group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Revitalization will identify and deliver federal resources to revitalize the economics of coal, oil, gas and power plant dependent communities. Outside the United States, a foreign climate agenda will be advanced through the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate in concert with departments including State and Treasury.
NRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate risks and opportunities to stakeholders. The Company became an early supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") recommendations after they were issued in 2017, published a TCFD mapping disclosure in December 2020 and will issue a stand-alone TCFD report in 2021.
Lower Carbon Infrastructure Development - Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported and continue to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other lower carbon infrastructure technologies. In addition, the costs associated with the development of lower carbon infrastructure, such as wind and solar generating facilities, continue to decline. These factors continue to drive increases in the development of lower carbon infrastructure in the markets where the Company participates, which may impact the ability of the Company's generating facilities to participate in those markets. According to ERCOT, Inc., 36% of 2020 energy consumption in the ERCOT market was generated from carbon emission-free resources, with wind power contributing 23%. In addition, subsidies and incentives have contributed to the increase in renewable power sources, and customer awareness and preferences are shifting toward sustainable solutions. Increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.
Digitization and Customization - The electric industry is experiencing major technology changes in the way power is distributed and used by end-use customers. The electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated from limited sources and flows in one direction, to a decentralized multidirectional system, where power can be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage.
Weather - Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG does business influence the Company's financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels and may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG's operations are typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. A significant portion of the Company's business is located within Texas, and extreme weather conditions occurring in Texas may have a material impact on the Company's financial position.
For discussion of the recent weather event in Texas, see Other Significant Events - Extreme Weather Event in Texas During February 2021 below.
Other Factors - A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:
•seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;
•extreme peak demands;
•available supply resources;
•transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;
•location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;
•procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and
•changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.
These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:
•weather conditions;
•market liquidity;
•capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;
•local transportation systems; and
•the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.
Environmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings - Details of environmental matters are presented in Item 15 - Note 26, Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 - Business, Environmental Matters. Details of regulatory matters are presented in Item 15 - Note 25, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 - Business, Regulatory Matters. Details of legal proceedings are presented in Item 15 - Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information relates to costs that may be material to the Company's financial results.
Transformation Plan
NRG completed its three-year Transformation Plan as of December 31, 2020. The Transformation Plan targets were achieved as follows:
•Achieved recurring cost savings and margin enhancement of $1,065 million, including $590 million of cumulative cost savings, a $215 million net margin enhancement program, $50 million annual reduction in maintenance capital expenditures, and $210 million in permanent selling, general and administrative expense reduction associated with asset sales
•Fully realized $370 million of non-recurring working capital improvements and $295 million of one-time costs to achieve
•Completed asset sales of $3.0 billion, accomplishing the planned portfolio optimization
•Initially targeted credit ratio of 3.0x net debt / adjusted EBITDA(a) was achieved. The credit metrics target was subsequently revised and successfully completed, to further strengthen its balance sheet and improve credit ratings by reducing leverage
(a) adjusted EBITDA as defined per the Senior Credit Facility
Other Significant Events
The following additional significant events occurred during 2020 and through the filing date:
Extreme Weather Event in Texas During February 2021
During February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GWs (without load shed). Ahead of the event, NRG launched residential customer communications calling for conservation across all of its brands, and initiated residential and commercial and industrial demand response programs to curtail customer load. The Company maximized available generating capacity and brought in additional resources to supplement in-state staff with technical and operating experts from the rest of its U.S. fleet. NRG is committed to working with all necessary stakeholders on a comprehensive, objective, and exhaustive root cause analysis of the entirety of the energy system.
The estimated financial impact is still preliminary, due to customer meter and settlement data not being finalized, as well as potential customer and counterparty risk and expected ERCOT default allocations. Based on a preliminary analysis, Winter Storm Uri's financial impact is not expected to be adverse to NRG's financial results. The Company separately stress-tested assumptions and although at a lower probability, this stress-test analysis indicated a potential plus or minus $100 million to income from continuing operations in 2021. NRG's integrated platform continues to deliver stable results through unprecedented events.
Direct Energy Acquisition
On January 5, 2021, the Company acquired Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increases NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and complements its integrated model. It also broadens the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it does not currently operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.
The Company paid an aggregate purchase price of $3.625 billion in cash, subject to a purchase price adjustment of $77 million. The Company funded the purchase price using a combination of $715 million of cash on hand, $166 million from a draw on its Revolving Credit Facility (of which $107 million was used to fund acquisition costs and financing fees that are not included in the aggregate purchase price above) as well as approximately $2.9 billion in secured and unsecured corporate debt issued in December 2020. The Company also increased its collective collateral facilities by $3.4 billion through a combination of amending its Revolving Credit Facility, amending its credit default swap facility, entering into a revolving accounts receivable financing facility, entering into an uncommitted repurchase facility and entering into multiple agreements to issue letters of credit. For further discussion on the increase of collateral facilities, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Item 15 - Note 13, Receivables Securitization and Repurchase Facility, and Item 15 - Note 14, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases.
Issuance of 2029 Senior Unsecured Notes and 2031 Senior Unsecured Notes
On December 2, 2020, NRG issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2029 (the "2029 Unsecured Notes") and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% senior notes due 2031 (the "2031 Unsecured Notes, together with the 2029 Unsecured Notes, the "Unsecured Notes").
Issuance of 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes
On December 2, 2020, NRG issued $1.4 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes, consisting of $500 million 2.000% senior secured first lien notes due 2025 (the "2025 Secured Notes") and $900 million 2.450% senior secured first lien notes due 2027 (the "2027 Secured Notes"), at a discount. The 2027 Secured Notes were issued under NRG’s Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which links attractive financing terms with the realization of certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Receivables Securitization and Repurchase Facility
On September 22, 2020, NRG Receivables LLC, a bankruptcy remote, special purpose, indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a revolving accounts receivable financing facility (the "Receivables Facility") for an amount up to $750 million, subject to adjustments on a seasonal basis, with issuers of asset-backed commercial paper and commercial banks (the "Lenders".) As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $198 million in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.
On September 22, 2020, the Company entered into an uncommitted repurchase facility (the “Repurchase Facility”) related to the Receivables Facility. Under the Repurchase Facility, the Company can borrow up to $75 million, collateralized by a subordinated note issued by NRG Receivables LLC to NRG Retail LLC in favor of the originating entities representing a portion of the balance of receivables sold to NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility.
For further discussion on the Receivables Facility and Repurchase Facility, see Note 9, Receivables Securitization and Repurchase Facility.
Midwest Generation Lease Purchase
On September 29, 2020, Midwest Generation acquired all of the ownership interests in the Powerton facility and Units 7 and 8 of the Joliet facility, which were being leased through 2034 and 2030, respectively, for approximately $260 million. The purchase was funded with cash-on-hand. Upon closing, lease expense related to these facilities, which totaled approximately $14 million in 2019, and the operating lease liability of $148 million were eliminated.
Home Solar Disposition
In the third quarter of 2020, the Company concluded its Home Solar business was held for sale and recorded an impairment loss of $29 million. On November 13, 2020, the Company completed the sale of the Home Solar business for cash proceeds of $66 million, resulting in a $2 million loss on the sale. In connection with the sale, the Company extinguished debt of $27 million and recognized a $5 million loss on the extinguishment.
Sale of Agua Caliente
On November 19, 2020, the Company entered an agreement to sell its 35% ownership in Agua Caliente to Clearway Energy, Inc. for $202 million. The sale of the 290 MW solar project closed on February 3, 2021. On October 21, 2019, the Company had repaid the Agua Caliente Borrower 1 notes associated with the project of $83 million.
Sale of 4.8 GW of Fossil Generation Assets
On February 28, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners, to sell approximately 4,850 MWs of fossil generating assets from its East and West regions of operations for total proceeds of $760 million, subject to standard purchase price adjustments and certain other indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG is entering into a tolling agreement for its 866 MW Arthur Kill plant in New York City through April 2025.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, and is subject to various closing conditions, approvals and consents, including FERC, NYSPSC, and antitrust review under Hart-Scott-Rodino.
Share Repurchases
In 2020, the Company completed $224 million of share repurchases at an average price of $33.05 per share, including $27 million of equivalent shares purchased in lieu of tax withholdings on equity compensation issuance.
Renewable Power Purchase Agreements
NRG began execution of its strategy to procure mid to long-term generation through power purchase agreements in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, NRG has entered into PPAs totaling approximately 1,800 MWs with third-party project developers and other counterparties. The tenor of these agreements is an average between eleven and twelve years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, certain of these PPA contracts have been amended to allow for the delay of project completion dates from mid-2021 into 2022. These amendments include improved terms for NRG.
Dividend Increase
In the first quarter of 2020, NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.20 from $0.12 per share, as part of a long-term capital allocation policy adopted in the fourth quarter of 2019 that targets allocating 50% of cash available for allocation generated each year to growth investments and 50% to be returned to shareholders. The return of capital to shareholders is expected to be completed through the increased dividend supplemented by share repurchases. The long-term capital allocation policy targets an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in years subsequent to 2020. In 2021, NRG further increased the annual dividend to $1.30 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2020.
Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table provides selected financial information for the Company:
(a)Includes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions
(b)Includes realized and unrealized trading gains and losses
(c)Includes amortization of SO2 and NOx credits and excludes amortization of RGGI credits
Economic Gross Margin
In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.
The tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 based on the Company's reportable segments:
The table below represents the weather metrics for 2020 and 2019:
(a) The West/Other weather metrics are comprised of the average of the CDD and HDD regional results for the West - California and West - South Central regions
(b) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Climate Prediction Center - A Cooling Degree Day, or CDD, represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. A Heating Degree Day, or HDD, represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period.
Gross margin and economic gross margin
Gross margin increased $83 million and economic gross margin increased $168 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The detail by segment is as follows:
Texas
East
West/Other
Mark-to-market for Economic Hedging Activities
Mark-to-market for economic hedging activities includes asset-backed hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges. Total net mark-to-market results decreased by $99 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.
The breakdown of gains and losses included in operating revenues and operating costs and expenses by segment was as follows:
Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are yet to be settled. The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.
The reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 the $95 million gain in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in New York capacity prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period. The $214 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in ERCOT power prices and heat rate contraction, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period.
For the year ended December 31, 2019 the $33 million gain in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period. The $53 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains, partially offset by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of gains on ERCOT heat rate positions due to heat rate expansion.
In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The realized and unrealized financial and physical trading results are included in operating revenue.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to higher revenues at Ivanpah driven by operational efficiencies and favorable weather.
Impairment Losses on Investments
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses on the Company's investment in Petra Nova Parish Holdings of $18 million, compared to $108 million recorded in the same period in 2019, as further described in Item 15 - Note 11, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Income, Net
Other income increased by $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to income from insurance proceeds received, partially offset by decreases in interest income and dividends received from cost method investments in 2020.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment
A loss on debt extinguishment of $9 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by the debt extinguished in connection with the sale of Home Solar and the redemptions of the Indian River and Dunkirk bonds.
A loss on debt extinguishment of $51 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the redemption of Senior Notes, due 2024, and the repayment of the 2023 Term Loan Facility.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, due to the following:
Income Tax Expense/(Benefit)
For the year ended December 31, 2020, NRG recorded income tax expense of $251 million on pre-tax income of $761 million. For the same period in 2019, NRG recorded an income tax benefit of $3.3 billion on pre-tax income of $786 million. The effective tax rate was 33.0% and (424.2)% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The large benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to a $3.5 billion release of the Company’s valuation allowance. Refer to Item 15 - Note 21, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the release in valuation allowance.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to state tax expense, recognition of state valuation allowance on NOLs, and return to provision adjustments.
The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. These factors and others, including the Company's history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.
Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax
Refer to Item 15 - Note 4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

(a)Includes reserves primarily for debt service, performance obligations and capital expenditures
As of December 31, 2020, total liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, increased by $4.9 billion. The increase was primarily driven by $2.9 billion of newly-issued secured and unsecured corporate debt and a $1.5 billion increase in collateral facilities to fund the Direct Energy acquisition. As of February 26, 2021, NRG had $3.8 billion of liquidity available to continue to support its operations. Changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed under the heading Cash Flow Discussion. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 were predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt.
Management believes that the Company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRG's common stockholders, and to fund other liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.
Credit Ratings
On July 24, 2020, Moody's affirmed NRG's corporate family rating of Ba1, with positive outlook. The agency also affirmed the ratings on all NRG's outstanding debt, including the Ba2 rating on senior unsecured bonds, Baa3 rating on senior secured bonds with fall-away security provisions and Baa2 rating on senior secured bonds without the fall-away feature. On July 27, 2020, S&P upgraded the NRG corporate family rating to BB+ with a stable outlook and senior unsecured rating to BB+.
The following table summarizes the Company's current credit ratings:
Liquidity
The principal sources of liquidity for NRG's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. As described in Item 15 - Note 14, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes.
The Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) market operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 - Note 14, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with return of capital and dividend payments to shareholders as described in Item 15 - Note 17, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, acquisition opportunities, and debt repayments.
Direct Energy Acquisition
On July 24, 2020, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Centrica plc to acquire Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthens its integrated model. It also broadens the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it did not previously operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.
The Company paid an aggregate purchase price of $3.625 billion in cash, subject to a purchase price adjustment of $77 million. The Company funded the purchase price using a combination of $715 million of cash on hand, $166 million from a draw on its Revolving Credit Facility (of which $107 million was used to fund acquisition costs and financing fees that are not included in the aggregate purchase price above) as well as approximately $2.9 billion in secured and unsecured corporate debt issued in December 2020. The Company also increased its liquidity and collateral facilities by $3.4 billion through a combination of new letter of credit facilities and increases to its existing Revolving Credit Facility, as further discussed below.

In connection with the issuance of the P-Caps, on December 2, 2020, NRG entered into a facility agreement for the issuance of letters of credit (the “LC Agreement”) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”) and administrative agent pursuant to which certain financial institutions (the “LC Issuers”) are permitted to join with commitments to provide letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $874 million to support the operations of NRG and its subsidiaries and minority investments, including to replace certain currently outstanding letters of credit and other credit support issued for the account of entities being acquired pursuant to the Acquisition. In addition, on December 2, 2020, the Trust entered into a pledge and control agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”), among NRG, the Trust and the Collateral Agent for the LC Issuers, under which the Trust agreed to grant a pledge over the Eligible Treasury Assets in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the LC Issuers. Pursuant to the LC Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent is entitled to withdraw Eligible Treasury Assets from the Trust’s pledged account, following notice to NRG, in the event NRG has failed to reimburse amounts drawn under any letter of credit issued pursuant to the LC Agreement, and the LC Issuers have the right to instruct the Collateral Agent to enforce the pledge over the Eligible Treasury Assets upon the occurrence of any event of default under the LC Agreement (a “Collateral Enforcement Event”).

The assets of NRG Receivables LLC are first available to satisfy the claims of the Lenders before making payments on the subordinated note and equity issued by NRG Receivables LLC. The assets of NRG Receivables LLC are not available to the Company and its subsidiaries and creditors unless and until distributed by NRG Receivables LLC. Under the Receivables Facility, certain indirect subsidiaries of the Company sell their accounts receivables to NRG Receivables LLC, subject to certain terms and conditions.

Cash flows from the Receivables Facility are reflected as financing activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company will continue to service the receivables sold in exchange for a servicing fee. The Receivables Facility is scheduled to expire on September 21, 2021, unless renewed by the mutual consent of the parties in accordance with its terms. Borrowings by NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility bear interest as defined under the Receivables Financing Agreement.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, and is subject to various closing conditions, approvals and consents, including FERC, NYSPSC, and antitrust review under Hart-Scott-Rodino.
CARES Act
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which provides, among other things, the option to defer payments of certain 2019 employer payroll taxes incurred after the date of enactment and pension contributions due in 2020, as well as claim a refund now for AMT credits from the IRS that were previously refundable over several years. As a result, the Company (i) deferred the payment of $17 million for the employer share of social security taxes that would otherwise have been due in 2020, with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due by December 31, 2022 and (ii) received $34 million of refundable AMT credits on August 4, 2020, inclusive of $17 million that was originally scheduled to be received in 2021. Of the amount received, $22 million was paid to GenOn for its share of the AMT credits received during the year of 2020.
Pension Plan Contribution
In the Company's 2019 Form 10-K, NRG had anticipated making contributions of $63 million to its pension plans, including STP, in 2020. Cash contributions of $18 million were made during 2020, of which $7 million was related to STP. The remaining planned contributions for 2020 were satisfied by available pre-funded pension balances (previous contributions in excess of required pension contributions).
Debt Service Obligations
Principal payments on debt and finance leases as of December 31, 2020 are due in the following periods:
The Company plans to reduce debt by nearly $1.2 billion during 2021 to maintain its targeted investment grade credit metrics. The Company intends to fund the repurchase from cash from operations. NRG continues to look at optimizing its debt structure and seeking out lower interest rates.
Market Operations
The Company's market operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development. As of December 31, 2020, market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $50 million and $768 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities for both wholesale and retail transactions. As of December 31, 2020, total funds deposited by counterparties was $19 million in cash and $75 million of letters of credit.
Future liquidity requirements, including those related to the acquisition of Direct Energy, may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, power purchases and sales, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.
First Lien Structure
NRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors of its senior debt. NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or gas used as a proxy for power. To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to NRG, the counterparty would have a claim under the first lien program. The first lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within the first lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its coal and nuclear capacity and 10% of its other assets with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.
The Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2020, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.
The following table summarizes the amount of MW hedged against the Company's coal and nuclear assets and as a percentage relative to the Company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as of December 31, 2020:
(a)Equivalent Net Sales include natural gas swaps converted using a weighted average heat rate by region
(b)Net coal and nuclear capacity represents 80% of the Company's total coal and nuclear assets eligible under the first lien, which excludes coal assets acquired in the Midwest Generation acquisition
Small Book Acquisitions
During 2020, the Company acquired multiple books of customers totaling approximately 56,000 customers for $22 million.

Growth investments in East for the year ended December 31, 2020 include the Astoria generating facility, for which the Company has proposed to replace existing units with a single, new state-of-the-art Simple Cycle Combustion Turbine having a total generating capacity of 437 MW. The Company is working to obtain the permits and regulatory approvals necessary to commence construction of the project. NRG is targeting 2023 for commercial operation. Additionally, included in other investments are expenditures for Encina site improvements classified as ARO payments. Demolition at the Encina site is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022. The Company expects to initiate the planning and marketing process of the Encina site in 2021.
Environmental Capital Expenditures Estimate
NRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2021 through 2025 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $61 million. These costs are primarily associated with the cost of complying with the federal CCR rule and ash storage projects.

See Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.
NRG conducts much of its business through and derives much of its income from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Non-Guarantors”). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.
In March 2020, the SEC adopted final rules that amend the financial disclosure requirements for subsidiary issuers and guarantees of registered debt securities under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, permitting registrants to disclose summarized financial information for each subsidiary issuer and guarantor. These final rules were codified in Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X.
In compliance thereof, the Company is including summarized financial information for NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors on a combined basis after transactions and balances within the combined entities have been eliminated.
The tables below present summarized financial information of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the SEC's Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
NRG may enter into power purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at power plants or retail load obligations.
NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.
The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2020, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2020. For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see Derivative Fair Value Measurements in Item 15 - Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio.
