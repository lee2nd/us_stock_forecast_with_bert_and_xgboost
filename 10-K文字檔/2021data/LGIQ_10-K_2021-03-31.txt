Our sources of liquidity and cash flows are used to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products and technologies, and provide ongoing support services for our customers. Over the next two fiscal years, we anticipate that we will use our liquidity and cash flows from our operations to fund our growth, particularly to grow our data sales. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and minority equity investments. Accordingly, a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses or minority equity investments. Such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, complete acquisitions or investments, integrate acquired businesses into our current operations, or expand into new markets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurances that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
As of December 31, 2020, we currently have material commitments for capital expenditures. Our capex & R&D plans are dependent on the availability of working capital and is able to be scaled back as required.
We know of no material trends in our capital trends aside from the funds to be raised in future offerings. We have focused our resources behind a plan to grow our data sales, where we have a technology advantage and higher margins. If we are successful in implementing our plan, we expect to return to a positive cash flow from operations. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve this objective.
We know of no trends or demands reasonably likely to affect liquidity other than those listed as Risk Factors.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, loss from operations used $(14,509,669), compared to $(6,541,686) for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did use cash $3,697,068 for investing activities in the Company’s financial asset investment portfolio based and managed in the US.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $8,687,759 from financing activities, compared to $11,888,037 of cash generated for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year, we issued Convertible promissory notes of $2,911,000, private placements in aggregate of $8,607,691, and DATALogiq received from the US Government notes payable loan of $503,700 under the CARES Act.
We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, that our available cash and the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up to 12 months. We have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. However, we shall continue to evaluate our capital expenditure needs based upon factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing, the timing of new product introductions, and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank, or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain expanded credit facilities to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, diversify our geographical reach, and grow our company. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. However, if cash flows from operations become insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing were obtained, then management would restructure the Company in a way to preserve its business while maintaining expenses within operating cash flows.
Known Trends or Uncertainties
We have seen some consolidation in the mobile applications industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward.
We believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new and enhanced PaaS applications will continue to result in SMBs utilizing our products and services. New product developments could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets; however, there can be no assurances that new products will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose all of our new product development activities.
The potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere.
Inflation
We have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented, and no material effect is expected in the near future.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have no material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020.

Our recently issued or newly adopted accounting standards are included in Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
We do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationship with us or our related parties.
