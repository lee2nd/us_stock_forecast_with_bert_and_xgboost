ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Introduction
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto. Our fiscal year ends December 31. This Report contains certain forward-looking statements including, among others, anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations and our business strategy. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please see “Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors". Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Important factors to consider in evaluating such forward-looking statements include changes in external factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations; unanticipated working capital or other cash requirements; changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the industries in which we operate; and various competitive market factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace. Forward-looking statements do not represent our views as of any date other than the date of this Report.
﻿
Business
﻿
We design, develop, manufacture and market organic light emitting diode, or OLED miniature displays, which we refer to as OLED-on-silicon microdisplays, virtual imaging products that utilize OLED microdisplays, and related products. We also perform research in the OLED field. Our virtual imaging products integrate OLED technology with silicon chips to produce high-resolution microdisplays which, when viewed through a magnifying headset, create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. Our products enable our original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers in the military and commercial markets to develop and market improved or new electronic products.
﻿
We believe that our OLED microdisplays offer a number of significant advantages over comparable liquid crystal microdisplays, including higher contrast, greater power efficiency, less weight, more compact size, and negligible image smearing. Using our active matrix OLED technology, many computer and electronic system functions can be built directly into the OLED microdisplays silicon backplane, resulting in compact, high resolution and power efficient systems. Already proven in military and commercial systems, our product portfolio of OLED microdisplays deliver high-resolution, virtual images that perform effectively even in extreme temperatures and high-vibration conditions.
﻿
We have been deemed to be an essential business in the State of New York and have continued to produce and ship products during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented employee health and safety measures per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, guidelines, including mandating use of personal protective equipment, employee temperature checking, daily location tracking and employee surveys, observing social distancing guidelines and enhanced facility cleaning. We continue to supply products to our customers as well as maintain continuity in our supply chain and expect to continue our operations throughout the duration of the pandemic and beyond. To date we have experienced disruptions in supply, had several employees test positive for the COVID-19 virus and had to close our facilities for cleaning purposes. There is no assurance that our operations will not be disrupted in the future by additional impacts of the COVID-19 virus or resurgences, on either our internal operations or those of our suppliers or customers, including the possible impact on state or international quarantine requirements on shipments or vendor support personnel. In addition, please review the various risk factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Report.
﻿
Operating expenses for 2020, including R&D expenses, increased approximately $1.0 million compared to 2019. The majority of the increase was due to higher legal costs and investments in R&D expenses for company-funded work related to our high-brightness dPd product and XLE process development, along with resources expended on improving manufacturing processes
﻿
﻿
We are continually making improvements in production processes, however the majority of our equipment is older and malfunctions in single point of failure equipment has the potential to delay our production until repairs can be made. We experienced equipment issues in 2019, and recently experienced some equipment issues during 2020, and also had delays in getting vendor support personnel due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Equipment to be purchased during fiscal 2021 and 2022 under our government awards programs is expected to reduce our single point of failure risk and improve manufacturing yields and throughput. We are in the process of implementing some of the processes from our yield improvement efforts and we have initiated an effort to explore an overall productivity improvement in the operations area that we believe has the potential to improve our results of operations. Our backlog at December 31, 2020 was $10.9 million compared to backlog of $11.7 million at December 31, 2019.
﻿
We believe that our U.S.-based design and manufacturing, combined with in-house advanced backplane design, and our dPd technology give us a competitive advantage. Our direct patterning equipment is operational. We have fabricated full color displays using the newly upgraded and installed dPd tool in the second quarter and shipped small quantities to customers in the second half of 2020.
﻿
We received a validation of our products and technology during fiscal 2020 from the U.S. government. In the past two quarters, we received two Department of Defense awards totaling $39.1 million. We believe we are the only U.S. manufacturer of OLED microdisplays and our displays are used in many U.S. Military programs.
﻿
Consumer, medical, and military customers are increasingly turning to us because of our technological leadership in display brightness and resolution. This leadership in brightness is further demonstrated by our proprietary dPd capability. Unlike traditional OLEDs that produce colors by using a white source with filters that eliminate about 80% of the emitted light, with dPd, we make full color displays by directly depositing each of the primary color materials on respective sub-pixels, without the use of filters. This advanced technology gives us an increase in brightness of over 10X versus the competition and we are close to achieving 10,000 cd/m2 and expect to achieve a brightness level of over 28,000 cd/m2 ready for mass production of full color displays by 2023. We achieved the highest monochrome brightness levels in the market years ago and are continuing our leadership with color displays. Display brightness is critical for AR/VR devices because of optics inefficiency and the need to eliminate motion artifacts. This is especially important for heads up displays used in bright, daylight environments.
Liquidity and Going Concern
﻿
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes we will continue to operate as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. However, due to continuing losses, uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial position, and uncertainty regarding our ability to borrow under the ABL Facility, and the expiration of our at At The Market (“ATM”) facility in July 2020 when the remaining amount available under the facility was used, we may not be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due without additional financing or sources of capital.
﻿
The pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is possible that the current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19, including any vaccine resistant strains, or any resurgence will cause the economic slowdown to continue, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Although vaccines are becoming more widely available, here is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of the pandemic and related slowdowns or economic trends. If either were prolonged, demand for our products will be significantly harmed. Although many jurisdictions are now open with social distancing measures implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19, but we cannot predict the length of time that it will take for any meaningful economic recovery to take place. We also cannot predict whether vaccine resistant strains will lead to additional surges in new cases of COVID-19, or the severity of such surges if/when they occur, such that governmental authorities decide to reimpose quarantines, lockdowns or travel restrictions, which could further materially and adversely affect our results and financial condition.
﻿
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, and we are subject to its continued listing requirements, including maintaining certain share prices and a minimum amount of shareholder’s equity. If we are unable to comply with the NYSE American continued listing requirements, including its trading price requirements, our common stock may be suspended from trading on and/or delisted from the NYSE American.
﻿
Results of Operations
﻿
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands)
Revenues
﻿
﻿
Revenues increased $2.7 million to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 10% increase.
﻿
Product revenues are comprised primarily of sales of displays as well as sales of other components. In 2020, product revenues increased $0.5 million to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from revenues of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 2% increase. The increase in product revenues in 2020 was primarily due to timing of orders from large defense contractors. Revenues in 2019 were impacted by manufacturing challenges that began in the fourth quarter of 2018, which affected yields and throughput and resulted in lower than planned shipments. These challenges continued during the first six months of 2019 but were resolved in the third quarter, resulting in increased revenues during the last six months of 2019.
﻿
Contract revenues are comprised of revenues from research and development, or R&D, and non-recurring engineering or NRE contracts. In 2020, contract revenues increased $2.2 million to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from revenues of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 105% increase. Higher contract revenues of $4.4 million in 2020 primarily reflected development work for a tier-one consumer company for an advanced display design and proof of concept for a consumer AR/VR device, which work is ongoing through 2021. The work with this customer is currently in the development and proof of concept stages. If this customer were to terminate its development process with us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
﻿
Cost of Revenues
﻿
﻿
﻿
Total cost of revenues is comprised of costs of product revenues and contract revenues. Cost of product revenue includes materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, warranty costs and depreciation related to our products. Cost of contract revenue includes direct and allocated indirect costs associated with performance on the contracts, primarily engineering resources and materials. Total cost of revenues increased by $3.1 million to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
﻿
Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 78% and 75%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
﻿
The following table outlines product, contract and total gross profit and related gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
﻿
﻿
﻿
Total gross profit is a function of revenues less cost of revenues. In fiscal 2020, total gross profit decreased approximately $0.4 million
or 5% from gross profit of $6.7 million in fiscal 2019. Total gross margin was 22% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, down from 25% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross margin for 2020 was impacted by issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including employee absences, stricter cleaning requirements, and longer than normal repair times as a result of travel restrictions for vendor personnel. Additionally, a key organic deposition tool was offline due to a scheduled overhaul.
﻿
Contract gross margin is dependent upon the mix of internal versus external third-party costs and materials, and the proportion of military and commercial revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, contract revenue gross profit was $2.4 million compared to $0.9 million for the prior year period. The increase in contract revenue gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to increased, higher margin consumer contract revenues during 2020.
﻿
Operating Expenses
﻿
﻿
﻿
Research and Development Expenses
﻿
R&D expenses are company funded and are primarily comprised of salaries and related benefits, development materials and other costs specifically allocated to the development of new microdisplay products, OLED technologies and production processes. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5.7 million as compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $0.7 million. The increase in R&D costs during 2020 reflects investments in company-funded work related to our high-brightness dPd product and XLE process development, along with resources expended on improving manufacturing processes.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
﻿
Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A expenses, consist primarily of personnel expenses, professional services fees, as well as other marketing, general corporate and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.6 million as compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $0.3 million. The increase was primarily due to higher spending on professional services and legal fees related to negotiations with prospective consumer electronics, volume manufacturer partners and arbitration of a dispute with a former contract manufacturer, offset by lower senior management salary expenses in 2020 due to the impact of the work status reduction adopted in October 2019.
﻿
Other Income (Expense)
﻿
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of changes in the fair value of a warrant liability as well as interest expense and interest income on cash balances. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.5 million compared to other income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
﻿
Expense related to the change in fair value of warrant liability was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This expense in fiscal year 2020 is associated with the increase of a liability related to registered warrants issued in May 2017 and January 2018, and the income in fiscal 2019 is associated with decreases in this liability. We are required to revalue warrants classified on our balance sheet as a liability at the end of each reporting period and reflect a gain or loss from the change in fair value in the period in which the change occurred. We calculate the fair value of the warrants outstanding using the Black-Scholes model.
﻿
In addition, during 2020 we recognized other income of $0.1 million related to deferred income and capitalization of internal costs related to equipment purchased under our government awards.
﻿
Other expense for the year December 31, 2020 reflects net interest expense of $0.1 million as compared to net interest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These amounts represent interest expense on our borrowing under our ABL Facility.
﻿
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
﻿
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no income tax expense. We have a full valuation allowance as we recognize
the effect of income tax positions, which are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. We have determined that it was not likely that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.
﻿
Net Loss
﻿
As a result of the above, net loss was approximately $11.4 million and $4.3 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
﻿
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
﻿
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had $8.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, working capital of $12.1 million and borrowing outstanding and borrowing availability under the ABL Facility of $1.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively. In addition, we have $1.9 million outstanding under a PPP loan, see below, which may be forgiven if the loan is used for eligible expenses and meets PPP criteria for forgiveness. This is in comparison with $3.5 million in cash, working capital $8.8 million and borrowings outstanding and borrowing availability under the ABL Facility of $ 2.9 million and $1.2 million December 31, 2019. The $4.8 million increase in cash was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of $4.9 million and investing activities of $2.5 million, offset by cash provided by financing activities of $14.3 million.
﻿
On June 11, 2020, we were granted a $5.5 million award from IBAS. We received these funds for procurement and installation of capital equipment in our NY-based manufacturing facility. This award will be managed under the Cornerstone Other Transaction Authority, or Cornerstone OTA, and fully funds Phase I of a three-phase agreement. This award was created to focus on strengthening the U.S. Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base. The release of funds to us began in August 2020 in accordance with down payments and progress payment schedules of the various capital equipment vendors.
﻿
On July 28, 2020, we received a $33.6 million award for the purchase of capital equipment over the next 33 months from the U.S. Department of Defense to sustain and enhance U.S. domestic capability for high resolution, high brightness OLED microdisplays that will be based on the Company’s proprietary direct patterning technology (“dPd”). This investment is in addition to the $5.5 million award announced on June 11, 2020, under the IBAS Program for OLED Supply Chain Assurance and will be used to increase capacity and sustain operations at eMagin’s Hopewell Junction, New York headquarters.
﻿
During 2020, the Company used $1.4 million of funds received to make down payments on equipment.
﻿
On June 8, 2020, the Company received a PPP loan from KeyBank National Association related to the COVID-19 crisis in the amount of $1.9 million. The PPP loan has a fixed interest rate of 1% per annum, a maturity date two years from the date of the funding of the loan, and deferral of payments for first six months. Pursuant to the terms of the loan, we may apply for forgiveness for an amount equal to the sum of the following costs incurred by us during period beginning on the date of first disbursement of the loan and ending on the earlier of (a) the date that is 24 weeks after the date of funding or (b) December 31, 2020, payroll costs, any payment of interest on a covered mortgage obligation, payment on a covered rent obligation, and any covered utility payment. The amount of loan forgiveness shall be calculated in accordance with the requirements of the PPP, including the provisions of Section 1106 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, although no more than 40% of the amount forgiven can be attributable to non-payroll costs. We have used the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP and filed an application for forgiveness with the Small Business Administration in December 2020. While we believe that our use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause us to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part.
﻿
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used by operating activities were $4.9 million, which was attributable to our net loss of $11.4 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(1.0) million partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $7.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used by operating activities were $5.1 million, which was primarily attributable to our net loss of $4.3 million and the effect of net non-cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
﻿
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash used by investing activities were $2.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, primarily due to less equipment purchases for upgrading and expanding the capacity of our production line during 2020.
﻿
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities were $14.3 million of which $9.8 million were from the net proceeds from a public offering and associated private placement of our common stock offset by the repayment of $1.0 million in borrowings under our ABL Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities were $6.4 million of
which $3.5 million were from the net proceeds from a public offering and associated private placement of our common stock and $2.9 million in net borrowings under our ABL Facility.
﻿
Going Concern
﻿
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue to operate as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
﻿
The pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is possible that the current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19, including any vaccine resistant strains, or any resurgence will cause the economic slowdown to continue, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Although vaccines are becoming more widely available, here is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of the pandemic and related slowdowns or economic trends. If either were prolonged, demand for our products will be significantly harmed. Although many jurisdictions are now open with social distancing measures implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19, but we cannot predict the length of time that it will take for any meaningful economic recovery to take place. We also cannot predict whether vaccine resistant strains will lead to additional surges in new cases of COVID-19, or the severity of such surges if/when they occur, such that governmental authorities decide to reimpose quarantines, lockdowns or travel restrictions, which could further materially and adversely affect our results and financial condition.
﻿
Due to continuing losses, the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty regarding our need or ability to borrow under our ABL Facility, and the expiration of the Company’s ATM facility in July 2020 when the remaining amount available under the facility was used, the Company may not be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due without additional financing or sources of capital. Therefore, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and based on the Company’s current financial condition and availability of funds, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through twelve months from the date these financial statements were issued.
﻿
We have taken actions to increase revenues and to reduce expenses and is considering financing alternatives. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we borrowed $1.9 million under the PPP loan program and raised $9.8 million of funds under our ATM Facility. Our plans with regard to these matters include the following actions:
﻿
·
focus production and engineering resources on improving manufacturing yields and increasing production volumes;
·
continue the Work Status Reduction program that began in October 2019 wherein senior management work status was reduced by approximately 20%;
·
reduce headcount and not replace departed employees, subject to PPP loan restrictions;
·
reduce discretionary and other expenses;
·
seek to enter new markets; and
·
consider additional financing and/or strategic alternatives.
﻿
We are reassessing our business plan and forecasts over the next two years. Based on our known cash needs as of February 2021, and the anticipated availability of its ABL facility, we have developed plans to extend our liquidity to support its working capital requirements through the first quarter of 2022. However, there can be no assurance our plans will be achieved, or that we will be able to continue to borrow under its ABL Facility, mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, secure additional financing, and/or pursue strategic alternatives on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.
﻿
In addition, even if we successfully generate additional funds through the sale of additional equity securities, borrowings or alternative financing, there can be no assurances that the revenue or capital infusion will be sufficient to enable us to develop our business to a level where it will be profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, a substantial portion of its operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our operational business activities. The terms of any debt securities issued could also impose significant restrictions on our operations. In addition, broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of its operating performance, and may adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds.
﻿
Equity Raises
﻿
On November 22, 2019, we entered into an ATM offering agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC or Wainwright relating to shares of our common stock. On June 10, 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement to update and amend the aggregate amount of shares we could sell pursuant to the ATM agreement.
﻿
During 2020, we raised $9.8 million, net of offering expenses, through the sale of shares under the ATM facility which represented the remaining amount available under the facility. We used and intend to use the net proceeds from sales made under the ATM offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes.
﻿
ABL Facility
﻿
On December 21, 2016, we entered into an asset based revolving credit facility with a lender that provides for up to a maximum amount of $5 million based on a borrowing base equivalent of 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of $2 million or 50% of eligible inventory. The interest on the ABL Facility is equal to the Prime Rate plus 3% but may not be less than 6.5% with a minimum monthly interest payment of $2,000. We are obligated to pay the lender a monthly administrative fee of $1,000 and an annual facility fee equal to 1% of the maximum amount borrowable under the facility.
﻿
The ABL Facility renewed on December 31, 2020 and will automatically renew on December 31, 2021 for a one-year term unless written notice to terminate the Financing Agreement is provided by either party.
The ABL Facility is secured by a lien on all receivables, property and the proceeds thereof, credit insurance policies and other insurance relating to the collateral, books, records and other general intangibles, inventory and equipment, proceeds of the collateral and accounts, instruments, chattel paper, and documents. The ABL Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including a provision that we maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $13 million and a minimum working capital balance of $4 million. As of December 31, 2020, there were $1.9 million net borrowings outstanding under the Financing Agreement, the interest rate was 6.5% and had unused borrowing availability of $2.1 million. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants as of December 31, 2020.
﻿
Change in Control Agreements
﻿
The Company entered into change in control agreements with certain of its executive officers, non-executive officers and managers. The agreements specify various employment-related matters, including annual compensation, performance incentive bonuses, and severance benefits in the event of termination with or without cause.
﻿
Dividends
﻿
In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no dividends were declared or paid. It is our intention to retain any future profits for use in the development and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes. Future decisions to pay cash dividends are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
﻿
Critical Accounting Policies
The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. However, the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the SEC definition.
﻿
Revenue and Cost Recognition
All of our revenues are earned from contracts with customers and are classified as either product or contract revenues. Contracts include written agreements and purchase orders, as well as arrangements that are implied by customary practices or law.
﻿
Product revenue is generated primarily from contracts to produce, ship and deliver OLED microdisplays. Our performance obligations are satisfied, control of our products is transferred, and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when control transfers to our customer for product shipped. Our customary terms are FOB our factory and control is deemed to transfer upon shipment. Shipping and other transportation costs charged to customers are treated as fulfillment activities and are recorded in both revenue and cost of sales at the time control is transferred to the customer. As customers are invoiced at the time control transfers and the right to consideration is unconditional at that time, we do not maintain contract asset balances for product revenue. Additionally, we do not maintain contract liability balances for product revenues, as performance obligations are satisfied prior to customer payment for product. We offer generally a one-year product warranty, for replacement of product only, and do not allow returns. We offer industry standard payment terms that typically require payment from our customers from 30 to 60 days after title transfer.
﻿
We also recognize revenues under the over-time method from certain R&D activities (contract revenues) under both firm fixed-price contracts and cost-type contracts. Progress and revenues from research and development activities relating to firm fixed-price contracts and cost-type contracts are generally recognized on an input method of accounting as costs are incurred. Under the input method, revenue is recognized based on efforts expended to date (e.g., the costs of resources consumed or labor hours worked, or machine hours used) relative to total efforts intended to be expended. Contract costs include all direct material, labor and subcontractor costs and an allocation of allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract, as periodically adjusted to reflect revised agreed upon rates. These rates are subject to audit by the other party. Any changes in estimate related to contract accounting are accounted for prospectively over the
remaining life of the contract. Under the over-time method, billings may not correlate directly to the revenue recognized. Based upon the terms of the specific contract, billings may be in excess of the revenue recognized, in which case the amounts are included in deferred revenues as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Likewise, revenue recognized may exceed customer billings in which case the amounts are reported as unbilled receivables. Unbilled revenues are expected to be billed and collected within one year. The incidental costs related to obtaining product sales contracts are non-recoverable from customers; and accordingly, are expensed as incurred.
Product Warranty
We offer generally a one-year product replacement warranty. In general, our standard policy is to repair or replace the defective products. We accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized based on historical activity as well as for specific known product issues. The determination of these accruals requires us to make estimates of the frequency and extent of warranty activity and estimate future costs to replace the products under warranty. If the actual warranty activity and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from these estimates, adjustments to cost of revenue may be required in future periods.
Inventory Valuation
﻿
Inventories are stated on a standard cost basis adjusted to approximate the lower of cost (as determined by the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the production of OLED displays. The standard cost for our products is subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter, depending primarily on the number of displays produced, fluctuations in manufacturing overhead and labor hours incurred, and the yields experienced in the manufacturing process. We regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of the inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, the inventory is reduced to a new cost basis.
﻿
Leases
﻿
We account for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842: Leases, which we adopted on January 1, 2019. As a lessee, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
﻿
Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, and use the implicit rate when readily determinable. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on a yield curve analysis, utilizing the interest rate derived from the fair value analysis of our credit facility and adjusting it for factors that appropriately reflect the profile of secured borrowing over the expected term of the lease. Some of our leases include the option to extend or terminate the lease. We include these options in the recognition of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
﻿
We enter into lease agreements for the use of office space, manufacturing facilities, and phone equipment, under both operating and finance leases.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term investments, accounts payable are stated at cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of our ABL Facility approximates our carrying value because the interest rate moves with a market-based rate plus a margin. The fair value of the liability for common stock purchase warrants is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model based on the market value of the underlying common stock at the measurement date, the contractual term of the warrant, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends and expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock.
﻿
The PPP loan is presented on the balance sheet, at cost which equals fair market value due to the loan’s short-term maturity, as the current portion of long-term debt, and long-term payables based upon the schedule of repayments and excluding any possible forgiveness of the loans.
﻿
Stock-based Compensation
﻿
We account for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors by estimating the fair value of stock awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Stock-based
compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures and is amortized over the vesting period using the straight-line method. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements- Stock Compensation for a further discussion on stock-based compensation.
﻿
Derivative Financial Instruments
﻿
We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features qualifying as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks.
