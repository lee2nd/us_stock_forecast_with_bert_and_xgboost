Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.
Overview
Denny’s restaurants are operated in 49 states, the District of Columbia, two U.S. territories and 11 foreign countries with principal concentrations in California (23% of total restaurants), Texas (12%) and Florida (8%). At December 30, 2020, the Denny’s brand consisted of 1,650 franchised, licensed and company restaurants. Of this amount, 1,585 of our restaurants were franchised or licensed, representing 96% of the total restaurants, and 65 were company restaurants.
Our revenues are derived primarily from two sales channels, which we operate as one segment: company restaurants and franchised and licensed restaurants. The primary sources of revenues are the sale of food and beverages at our company restaurants and the collection of royalties, advertising revenue, initial and other fees and occupancy revenue from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the Denny’s name. Sales and customer traffic at both company and franchised restaurants are affected by the success of our marketing campaigns, new product introductions, product quality enhancements, customer service, availability of off-premise dining options, and menu pricing, as well as external factors including competition, economic conditions affecting consumer spending and changes in guests’ tastes and preferences. Sales at company restaurants and royalty, advertising and fee income from franchised restaurants are also impacted by the opening of new restaurants, the closing of existing restaurants, the sale of company restaurants to franchisees and the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees.
Costs of company restaurant sales are exposed to volatility in two main areas: payroll and benefit costs and product costs. The volatility of payroll and benefit costs results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses, such as medical benefit costs and workers’ compensation costs. Additionally, changes in guest counts and investments in store-level labor impact payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales. Many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are, therefore, subject to price volatility. This volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable. In general, we purchase food products based on market prices or we set firm prices in purchase agreements with our vendors. In an inflationary commodity environment, our ability to lock in prices on certain key commodities is imperative to controlling food costs. In addition, our continued success with menu management helps us offer menu items that provide a compelling value to our customers while maintaining attractive product costs and profitability. Packaging costs also fluctuate with changes in delivery and off-premise sales.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Wednesday in December. As a result, a fifty-third week is added to a fiscal year every five or six years. Fiscal 2020 included 53 weeks of operations, whereas 2019 and 2018 each included 52 weeks of operations. We estimate that the additional operating week added approximately $6.3 million of operating revenue in 2020.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Sales Trends
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our sales during 2020. In 2019, prior to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our average annual restaurant sales were $2.5 million for company restaurants and $1.7 million for domestic franchised restaurants. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our average annual restaurant sales declined to $1.8 million for company restaurants and $1.2 million for domestic franchised restaurants. Additionally, average unit volumes of off-premise sales have more than doubled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, supported by temporarily waived delivery fees, curbside service programs and shareable family meal packs.
The following table presents monthly sales results compared to the equivalent fiscal periods in 2019:

Total 100%
Franchise and License Revenue Reductions
In addition to the impacts that reduced sales had on franchise and licenses revenues, certain forms of franchise support resulted in reductions to these revenues throughout 2020 including:
•abatement of $6.0 million of royalties including $1.9 million in the first quarter, $3.1 million in the second quarter and $1.0 in the fourth quarter;
•abatement of $1.3 million of advertising fees in the first quarter.
Cost Savings Initiatives
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also implemented the following cost savings initiatives:
•suspended travel and canceled in-person field meetings;
•placed holds on all open corporate and field positions;
•significantly reduced restaurant level staffing across the company restaurant portfolio;
•meaningfully reduced compensation for our Board of Directors and multiple levels of management; and
•furloughed over 25% of the employees at our corporate office, approximately half of which were subsequently separated from the Company.
We subsequently eased certain of these cost savings measures. For example, we have resumed recruiting for certain corporate and field positions, and the compensation reductions expired on June 25, 2020.
We also secured $2.6 million of federal tax credits in connection with wages paid to retained employees during the crisis under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Liquidity Actions Taken
Effective February 27, 2020, we suspended share repurchases, and effective March 16, 2020 terminated our Rule 10b5-1 Plan in both cases in light of uncertain market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective May 13, 2020 and December 15, 2020, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a second and third amendment, respectively, to the current credit facility which amended the credit agreement dated as of October 26, 2017. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility. As of December 30, 2020, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants related to the amended credit facility.
On July 6, 2020, we closed on the issuance and sale of 8,000,000 shares of common stock. Net proceeds of $69.6 million were received after deducting the underwriters’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company and disbursed to pay down the outstanding balance on the credit facility.
Growing and Revitalizing the Brand
Over the last five years, our growth initiatives have led to 169 new restaurant openings. During 2020, our franchisees opened 20 restaurants, of which eight are international franchised locations, including four in Canada, two in Mexico, and one each in Indonesia and Central America. Our goal is to increase net restaurant growth through both domestic and international avenues. Domestic growth will continue to focus on markets in which we have modest penetration. Development agreements related to the sale of 113 of our company restaurants during 2018 and 2019 and recently enhanced development agreements in Canada and the Philippines are expected to stimulate both domestic and international growth over the next several years.
A total of 22 remodels were completed during 2020, consisting of 20 at franchised restaurants and two at company restaurants. Eleven of these remodels were in our Heritage image, which we launched in late 2013. This updated look reflects a more contemporary diner feel to further reinforce our America’s Diner positioning. The remaining 11 restaurants updated to our Heritage 2.0 image which features more attention-grabbing exterior elements while extending the relaxing interior elements from the original Heritage program. As of the end of 2020, approximately 91% of the restaurants in the system have been remodeled to one of our two Heritage images.
Balancing the Use of Cash
Though certain strategies have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are still focused in the longer term on balancing the use of cash between reinvesting in our base of company restaurants, growing and strengthening the brand and returning cash to shareholders. During 2020, cash capital expenditures were $7.0 million. Our real estate strategy is to redeploy proceeds from the sale of certain pieces of our owned real estate to acquire higher quality real estate underlying company and franchised restaurants. During 2020, we generated $9.4 million of cash proceeds from the sale of real estate.
Prior to suspending share repurchases, during 2020, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $34.2 million. Since initiating our share repurchase program in November 2010, we have repurchased a total of 54.0 million shares of our common stock for $553.9 million. The Company is prohibited from paying dividends and making stock repurchases and other general investments until the date of delivery of our financial statements for the fiscal quarter ending September 29, 2021. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility.
In December 2019, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization for $250 million. As of December 30, 2020, there was approximately $248.0 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization.
Other Factors Impacting Comparability
For 2020, 2019 and 2018, the following items impacted the comparability of our results:
•Company restaurant sales decreased from $411.9 million in 2018 to $118.2 million in 2020, primarily from the impact of the sale of 113 company restaurants to franchisees during 2019 and 2018 and, in 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Royalty income, which is included as a component of franchise and license revenue, increased from $101.6 million in 2018 to $108.8 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of company restaurants to franchisees, increases in same-store sales and a higher average royalty rate. The subsequent decrease to $67.5 million in 2020 was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
•Occupancy revenues, included as a component of franchise and license revenue, result from leasing or subleasing restaurants to franchisees. When restaurants are sold and leased or subleased to franchisees, the occupancy costs related to these restaurants move from costs of company restaurant sales to costs of franchise and license revenue to match the
related occupancy revenue. Additionally, as leases or subleases with franchisees expire, franchise occupancy revenue and costs could decrease if franchisees enter into direct leases with landlords. Occupancy revenue has increased from $32.0 million in 2018 to $41.9 million in 2020 as a result of the sale of restaurants to franchisees, partially offset by the impact of lease expirations. At the end of 2020, we had 265 franchised restaurants that were leased or subleased from Denny’s, compared to 243 at the end of 2018.
______________
(1) Domestic system-wide same-store sales include sales at company restaurants and non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that were open the same period in noted prior period. While we do not record franchise and licensed sales as revenue in our consolidated financial statements, we believe system-wide same-store sales information is useful to investors in understanding our financial performance, as our royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. Accordingly, system-wide same-store sales should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, our results as reported under GAAP.
Statements of Operations
(a)Costs of company restaurant sales percentages are as a percentage of company restaurant sales. Costs of franchise and license revenue percentages are as a percentage of franchise and license revenue. All other percentages are as a percentage of total operating revenue.
(b)Equivalent units are calculated as the weighted average number of units outstanding during a defined time period.
(c)Same-store sales include sales from company restaurants or non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that were open the same period in the prior year. While we do not record franchise and licensed sales as revenue in our consolidated financial statements, we believe domestic franchised same-store sales information is useful to investors in understanding our financial performance, as our royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. Accordingly, domestic franchised same-store sales should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, our results as reported under GAAP.
(d)Prior year amounts have not been restated for 2020 comparable restaurants.
Unit Activity
Company Restaurant Operations
Company same-store sales decreased 36.7% in 2020 and increased 1.9% in 2019 compared with the respective prior year. Company restaurant sales for 2020 decreased $188.2 million, or 61.4%, primarily resulting from a 59 equivalent unit decrease in company restaurants and a 36.7% decrease in company same-store sales caused primarily by dine-in restrictions and temporary closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Company restaurant sales for 2019 decreased $105.6 million, or 25.6%, primarily resulting from a 55 equivalent unit decrease in company restaurants, partially offset by the increase in same-store sales.
Total costs of company restaurant sales as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 97.0% in 2020, 84.3% in 2019 and 84.7% in 2018 consisting of the following:
Product costs were 25.2% in 2020 and 24.4% in 2019 and 2018. For 2020, the increase was due to increases in paper products due to the increase in delivery and to-go orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2019, leverage gained from increased pricing offset the impacts of commodity price increases.
Payroll and benefits were 43.7% in 2020, 38.8% in 2019 and 39.9% in 2018. The 2020 increase as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of sales deleveraging caused by lower sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 increase included a 3.2 percentage point increase in management labor, 0.8 percentage point increase in team labor, and 0.3 percentage point increase in fringe benefits. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to a 0.4 percentage point decrease in payroll taxes and fringe benefits, a 0.5 percentage point decrease in labor resulting from the impact of refranchising restaurants and a 0.1 percentage point decrease in workers' compensation costs related to claims development.
Occupancy costs were 9.5% in 2020, 6.1% in 2019 and 5.6% in 2018. For 2020, the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sales deleveraging effect caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the impact of refranchising of restaurants during 2019 where we owned the real estate contributed to the rate increase. The 2019 increase was related to a 0.3 percentage point increase in rental costs primarily due to the impact of refranchising restaurants and a 0.2 percentage point increase in general liability costs primarily due to higher property insurance costs.
Other operating expenses consisted of the following amounts and percentages of company restaurant sales:
Other direct costs were higher as a percentage of sales for 2020 due to the deleveraging effect of lower sales as well as higher delivery costs due to the increase in delivery sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2019, the increases in repairs and maintenance as a percentage of company restaurant sales were primarily due to additional costs related to the sale of company restaurants sold to franchisees as part of our refranchising and development strategy.
Franchise Operations
Franchise and license revenue and costs of franchise and license revenue consisted of the following amounts and percentages of franchise and license revenue for the periods indicated:
Royalties decreased by $41.3 million, or 38.0%, in 2020 primarily resulting from a 30.9% decrease in domestic same-store sales. Additionally, we abated $6.0 million of royalties during the year to help our franchisees weather the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 36 equivalent units resulting from our refranchising and development strategy in 2019. Royalties increased by $7.3 million, or 7.1%, in 2019 primarily resulting from a 40 equivalent unit increase from the impact of our refranchising and development strategy and a 2.0% increase in domestic same-store sales. The average domestic royalty rate, including the impact of abatements, was 3.86%, 4.22% and 4.17% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Advertising revenue decreased $27.4 million, or 33.8%, in 2020 resulting from the decrease in same-store sales. Additionally, we abated $1.3 million of advertising fees during the year. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 36 equivalent units resulting from our refranchising and development strategy in 2019. Advertising revenue increased $2.8 million, or 3.6%, in 2019 resulting from the the increase in equivalent units and impact of the increase in same-store sales. Initial and other fees increased $0.1 million, or 1.9%, as the recognition of revenue on additional franchised units from the sale of restaurants to franchisees exceeded the impact of less accelerated revenue recognition during 2019 as a result of fewer franchised unit closures compared to 2018.
Occupancy revenue increased $3.4 million, or 8.7%, in 2020 primarily resulting from additional leases and subleases to franchisees as a result of our refranchising and development strategy in 2019. Occupancy revenue increased by $6.6 million, or 20.5%, in 2019 primarily resulting from the sale of restaurants to franchisees.
Costs of franchise and license revenue decreased $26.0 million, or 21.6%, in 2020. The decreases were primarily related to lower advertising costs, which corresponds to the related advertising revenue decreases noted above. Occupancy costs increased $0.9 million, or 3.6%, in 2020, primarily related to the sale of leased company units to franchisees in the prior year, partially offset by lower percentage rent expense as a result of the sales decreases. Other direct costs increased $0.5 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to $1.5 million of bad debt allowances resulting from actual and expected losses on franchise related receivables due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, costs of franchise and license revenue as a percentage of franchise and license revenue increased to 55.4% for 2020 from 51.2% in 2019.
Costs of franchise and license revenue increased $6.0 million, or 5.3%, in 2019. Advertising costs increased $2.8 million, or 3.6%. Occupancy costs increased $3.5 million, or 15.8%. The changes to advertising costs and occupancy costs were a result of the changes in the related revenues noted above. Other direct costs decreased $0.3 million, or 2.4%. The decrease resulted primarily from lower franchise administration costs. As a result, costs of franchise and license revenue as a percentage of franchise and license revenue decreased to 51.2% in 2019 from 52.4% in 2018.
Other Operating Costs and Expenses
Other operating costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense relate to both company and franchise operations.
General and administrative expenses are comprised of the following:
Total general and administrative expenses decreased by $14.0 million, or 20.3%, in 2020 and increased by $5.2 million, or 8.1%, in 2019. Corporate administrative expenses decreased by $9.2 million in 2020 and decreased by $2.1 million in 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax credits related to the CARES Act of approximately $1.7 million and the rationalization of certain business costs in connection with our refranchising and development strategy. The 2019 decrease was primarily due to the rationalization of certain business costs in connection with our refranchising and development strategy. Share-based compensation increased by $1.3 million and $0.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Incentive compensation decreased by $5.1 million in 2020 and increased by $3.0 million in 2019. The changes in share-based compensation and incentive compensation for both periods primarily resulted from our performance against plan metrics and as the result of modifications to certain 2018 and 2019 share-based compensation awards during the fourth quarter of 2020. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the modifications. Changes in deferred compensation valuation adjustments have offsetting gains or losses on the underlying nonqualified deferred plan investments included as a component of other nonoperating (income) expense, net.
Depreciation and amortization is comprised of the following:
In 2020 and 2019, the decrease in total depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of the sale of owned company units to franchisees as part of our refranchising and development strategy during 2019.
Operating (gains), losses and other charges, net are comprised of the following:
Gains on sales of assets and other, net of $4.7 million for 2020 primarily related to the sale of real estate. Gains on sales of assets and other, net of $93.6 million for 2019 related to the sale of restaurants and real estate to franchisees. Gains on sales of assets and other, net of $0.5 million for 2018 primarily related to $1.2 million of insurance settlement gains on fire-damaged and hurricane-damaged restaurants, partially offset by $0.7 million of losses on sales of company owned units to franchisees. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details on refranchisings.
Restructuring charges and exit costs were comprised of the following:
During the year ended December 30, 2020, the Company permanently separated approximately 50 support center staff resulting in increased severance and other restructuring charges for the year. Severance and other restructuring charges for 2019 and 2018 were primarily the result of positions eliminated as part of our refranchising and development strategy.
Impairment charges of $4.1 million for 2020 were the result of assessments of the recoverability of assets resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Impairment charges of $1.6 million for 2018 primarily related to the impairment of an underperforming unit.
Operating income was $6.7 million in 2020, $165.0 million in 2019 and $73.6 million in 2018.
Interest expense, net is comprised of the following:
Interest expense, net decreased during 2020 and 2019 primarily due to a reduction in financing lease interest resulting from the sales of restaurants to franchisees during 2019.
Other nonoperating (income) expense, net was income of $4.2 million for 2020, income of $2.8 million for 2019 and expense of $0.6 million for 2018. The income for 2020 includes losses on interest rate swaps of $7.4 million resulting from the discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment on a portion of our interest rate swaps and income of $10.3 million related to interest rate swap valuation adjustments on dedesignated interest rate swaps subsequent to the discontinuation of hedge accounting and $1.8 million in gains on deferred compensation plan investments. The income for 2019 primarily resulted from gains on deferred compensation plan investments. The expense for 2018 was primarily the result of losses on deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by gains on lease terminations. For additional details related to the interest rate swaps, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The provision for (benefit from) income taxes was a benefit of $2.0 million for 2020, expense of $31.8 million for 2019 and expense of $8.6 million for 2018. The effective tax rate was 28.1% for 2020, 21.3% for 2019 and 16.4% for 2018.
For 2020, the difference in the overall effective rate from the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to state and foreign taxes and the generation of employment credits. The 2020 rate was also impacted by a $0.9 million benefit from the statutory rate differential due to a net operating loss carryback to a prior year and an expense of $1.0 million from disallowed compensation deductions.
For 2019, there was no significant difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate of 21%. The impact of state taxes on the statutory rate was partially offset by the generation of employment and foreign tax credits. In addition, the 2019 rate benefited $2.0 million related to share-based compensation and $2.0 million related to the completion of an Internal Revenue Service federal income audit of the 2016 tax year.
The 2018 rate was primarily impacted by the statutory tax rate reduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For 2018, the difference in the overall effective rate from the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to state taxes and the generation of employment and foreign tax credits. In addition, the 2018 rate benefited $1.4 million related to share-based compensation.
Net income (loss) was a loss of $5.1 million for 2020, income of $117.4 million for 2019 and income of $43.7 million for 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Summary of Cash Flows
Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility (as described below). Principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures and, prior to the second quarter of 2020, the repurchase of shares of our common stock.
The following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated:
Net cash flows used in operating activities were $3.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2020 compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of $43.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2019. The decrease in cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of prior year accrual payments. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $43.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2019 compared to $73.7 million for the year ended December 26, 2018. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the reduction in equivalent units and the related runoff of liabilities resulting from the sale of company restaurants. We believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for 2021, combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility, will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next twelve months.
Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $4.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2020. These cash flows are primarily proceeds from the sale of real estate of $9.4 million and proceeds from the sale of investments of $2.9 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $7.0 million and investment purchases of $1.4 million. Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $105.0 million for the year ended December 25, 2019. These cash flows are primarily comprised of $129.7 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, including $119.0 million from the sale of 105 restaurants and $10.7 million from the sale of real estate. These cash flows are offset by capital expenditures of $14.0 million and acquisitions of real estate of $11.3 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $32.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2018. These cash flows are primarily comprised of capital expenditures of $22.0 million and acquisitions of restaurants and real estate of $10.4 million. Cash flows for acquisitions include $8.1 million for the reacquisition of six franchised restaurants, $1.8 million for real estate and $0.5 million related to a prior year acquisition.
Our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the following:
Cash flows used in financing activities were $1.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2020, which included net debt repayments of $31.6 million, cash payments for stock repurchases of $36.0 million offset by proceeds of $69.6 million from the issuance of common stock. Cash flows used in financing activities were $150.0 million for the year ended December 25, 2019, which included stock repurchases of $94.5 million and net debt repayments of $49.0 million. Cash flows used in financing activities were $41.6 million for the year ended December 26, 2018, which included stock repurchases of $61.2 million and the purchase of a $6.8 million equity forward contract related to an accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into in 2018, partially offset by net debt borrowings of $24.3 million.
Our working capital deficit was $28.5 million at December 30, 2020 compared with $42.8 million at December 25, 2019. The decrease in working capital deficit was primarily related to lower payables and accruals resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because (1) restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable, (2) rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories and (3) accounts payable for food, beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales.
Credit Facility
We have a $375 million senior secured revolver due October, 26, 2022. As of December 30, 2020, we had outstanding revolver loans of $210.0 million and outstanding letters of credit under the senior secured revolver of $17.3 million. These balances resulted in availability of $147.7 million under the credit facility prior to considering the liquidity covenant in our credit facility. Factoring in the liquidity covenant, our availability was $81.6 million. The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility is guaranteed by Denny's and its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of Denny's and its subsidiaries, including the stock of its subsidiaries (other than our insurance captive subsidiary). During the year, we executed two amendments to our credit agreement, which modified the agreement as described below.
On May 13, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the "Second Amendment") to our credit agreement. As a result of the Second
Amendment, beginning May 13, 2020 until the date of delivery of our financial statements for the fiscal quarter ending June 30,
2021, the interest rate of the amended credit agreement was increased to LIBOR plus 3.00% and the commitment fee, paid on the unused portion of the credit facility, was increased to 0.40%. During this period, we also had supplemental monthly reporting obligations to our lenders and were prohibited from paying dividends and making stock repurchases and other general investments. Additionally, capital expenditures were to be restricted to $10 million in the aggregate from May 13, 2020 through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021.
The Second Amendment temporarily waived certain financial covenants. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was
waived until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021, at which point the covenant level was to revert to a minimum of 1.50x. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant was waived until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021, at which point the covenant level was to increase from 4.00x to 4.50x, stepping down to 4.25x in the second quarter of 2021 and 4.00x in the third fiscal quarter of 2021 and thereafter. In addition, the Second Amendment added a monthly minimum liquidity covenant, defined as the sum of unrestricted cash and revolver availability, ranging from $60 million to $70 million, commencing on May 13, 2020 to May 26, 2021.
On December 15, 2020, we executed an additional amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to our credit agreement.
