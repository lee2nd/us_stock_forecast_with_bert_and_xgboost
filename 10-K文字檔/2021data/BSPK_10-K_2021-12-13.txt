Overview
We sell a proprietary line of specially-formulated, premium quality, hemp-derived CBD products direct to consumers through our ecommerce store, found at www.bespokeextracts.com. Information on our website is not part of this report.
Under our expanded operating plan, we intend to methodically expand our product offerings to include new flavors, including manuka honey; and introduce additional form factors for our CBD formulations, including lotions and balms, depending on customer feedback and evolving consumer demand.
In November 2021, new management of the Company was appointed and the Company began to focus on other complimentary lines of business to its CBD offerings. Under our new management team, we plan to expand the Company’s focus to regulated cannabis markets in the United States.
Results of Operations for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020
Sales
Sales during the year ended August 31, 2021 were $35,566 compared to $8,054 for the year ended August 31, 2020. The increase in sales was primarily a result of increased marketing of the Company’s new line-up of hemp-derived CBD products and sales of older products at reduced prices.
Operating Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 were $640,880 and $3,647,610, respectively. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses, option and warrant expense for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 was $0 and $3,467,440, respectively which was primarily due to the fair value re-measurement of warrants and options, and the issuance of options to our then-President and CEO. Stock-based compensation for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 were $0 and $40,500, respectively which was a result of common stock issued for services. Professional fees were $105,950 and $185,603, respectively for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020. The decrease in expenses was due to reduced legal and accounting fees as the Company streamlined operations. Consulting expense was $237,500 and $184,062, for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively. The increase was primarily due to additional consulting agreements for sales and marketing during the year ended August 31, 2021. Amortization expense of domain names for the year ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 was $3,244 and $2,797, respectively.
Loss on settlement of debt
On December 24, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Repayment Agreement”) with the holder of the amended and restated original issue discount convertible debenture issued by the Company on November 11, 2019, in the original principal amount of $200,000 (the “November 2019 Debenture”). Pursuant to the Repayment Agreement, the Company paid the holder $120,000, and transferred certain URLs valued at $5,282 to the holder, and the November 2019 Debenture was deemed paid in full. The Company recognized a loss on settlement of debt of $89,595 during the year ended August 31, 2020.
Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount
Interest expense on promissory notes for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 was $0 and $535,688 respectively. The decrease in interest expense was due to the amortization expense for the warrants and beneficial conversion associated with those notes that had been converted to common stock or fully amortized during the year ended August 31, 2020.
Net Loss
For the reasons stated above, our net loss for the year ended August 31, 2021 was $965,577, or $0.00 per share, compared to a net loss for the year ended August 31, 2020 of $4,640,806, or $0.04 per share.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of August 31, 2021, we had cash of $11,177. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended August 31, 2021 was $1,040,965. Our current liabilities as of August 31, 2021 were $542,762 and consisted of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $42,228, notes payable- related party of $534 and a convertible note payable of $500,000. As of August 31, 2020, we had cash of $126,603. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended August 31, 2020 was $465,240. The increase in net cash used in operating activities during the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to August 31, 2020 was a result of the Company purchasing new inventory and an increase in prepaid expenses, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
During the year ended August 31, 2021, the Company raised $800,000 from the sale of common stock. During the year ended August 31, 2021 the Company received a total of $130,534 of loans from our then-Chief Executive Officer. During the year ended August 31, 2020, the Company raised $125,000 from the sale of common stock. During the year ended August 31, 2020, the Company received a total of $400,000, net of original issue discounts, from the sale of a convertible note and repaid $120,000. During the year ended August 31, 2020 the Company repurchased $27,500 of common stock and received $84,000 from the exercise of stock options.
The financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming a continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company had negative cash flows from operations for the year ended August 31, 2021 and had a working capital deficit at August 31, 2021. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Our primary source of capital has been from the sale of equity and convertible debt securities. Our primary use of capital has been for professional fees and selling, general and administrative costs. We have no committed sources of capital and will need to raise additional capital to continue and expand our operations. Additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations, including by limiting access to our facilities, customers, management, and professional advisors, and by causing delays and constraints in manufacturing and shipping of our products. These factors, in turn, may negatively impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our products, and our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms, or at all.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described below and in Note 1 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at fair value on the date revenue is recognized. The Company provides allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to repay their obligation. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay, additional allowances may be required. The Company provides for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on specific customer identification and historical collection experience adjusted for existing market conditions. If market conditions decline, actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in decreased cash flows and increased bad debt expense.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as sales price less cost of completion, disposition and transportation and a normal profit margin.
Income Taxes
We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable. We have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period. If we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination. We expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets.
