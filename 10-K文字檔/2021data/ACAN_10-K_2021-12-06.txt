ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Select Quarterly Financial Information
Quarter Ended September 30, 2021 compared to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2020
The Company achieved four consecutive quarters of increased operating revenue, culminating in positive net income for the quarter ending September 2021. Our revenue from operations increased approximately 303% for the year ended September 2021 relative to the year ended September 2020, an increase of $1,525,039. The operating revenue for the quarter ended September 2021 was approximately 156% greater than the September quarter in 2020.
The increase in financial performance is attributable to greater revenue received from products produced and manufactured at Building 1, the Company's initial development at its Massachusetts Cannabis Center in Freetown, Massachusetts.
Results of Operations
Year Ended September 30, 2021 compared to the Year Ended September 30, 2020
Total Revenues
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we generated $2,028,551 in revenue, as compared to $503,512 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in revenue is due to the rental revenue and participation fee revenue due to completion of Building 1.
Cost of Revenues
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we incurred $38,149 of costs of revenue, as compared to $22,500 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in costs is due to increased building maintenance costs.
Advertising and Marketing Expenses
Advertising and marketing expenses were $42,417 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $38,179 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase is due to an increase in social media costs.
Professional Fees
Professional fees were $311,288 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $405,920 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in professional fees is primarily due a decrease in legal and consulting fees.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $1,592,404 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $1,985,142 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in stock compensation expense offset by an increase in licenses and fees.
Recovery of Provision for Doubtful Accounts
(Recovery) of provision for doubtful accounts was $0 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $(1,761,675) for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase is a result of a reversal of the reserve on the receivable balance with WGP, as the payment was received in February 2020.
Interest Income
Interest income was $18,305 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $333,681 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease is a result of the collection of the receivable balance from WGP during 2020.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $925,491 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $856,470 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to interest on the $4,500,000 loan and the amortization of debt discounts.
Net Loss
We had a net loss of $862,893 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $709,343 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in net loss is primarily the result of a reversal of the reserve on the receivable balance with WGP. If it were not for the reversal of this reserve, our net loss for the year ended September 30, 2020 would have been $2,471,018 and our net loss for the year ended September 30, 2021 would have been less than our net loss for the year ended September 30, 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Loans
In February 2021, we borrowed $300,000 from an unrelated party. The loan was unsecured, had an interest rate of 11% per year and was due and payable on August 2, 2021. The loan was fully paid in July 2021.
In August 2020, we borrowed $153,000 from an unrelated party, inclusive of $3,000 of debt issuance costs. The loan bore an interest rate of 10% per year and was due on August 21, 2021. The loan was repaid in February 2021.
On September 30, 2019, we amended and modified two notes payable due to Strategic Capital Partners, LLC, a company controlled by Benjamin J. Barton, one of our officers and directors, with balances of $1,000,000 and $756,646 into one note, in the principal amount of $1,756,646, bearing interest of 9% per year and maturing on December 31, 2022. Additionally, the conversion option in the first note was eliminated. As additional consideration for the modification of the notes, the note holder received warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The warrants are exercisable at a price of $1.25 per share and expire on December 31, 2022. The fair value of the 1,500,000 warrants was $977,110 and was recognized as loss on extinguishment of debt.
On August 2, 2019 we secured a $4,000,000 loan from an unrelated third party. The loan was evidenced by a note which bears interest at the rate of 11% per year, is due and payable on August 2, 2022 and is secured by a first lien on Building 1 at the MCC.
The note holder also received a warrant which allows the holder to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $1.50 per share. The warrant will expire on the earlier of (i) August 2, 2024 or (ii) twenty days after written notice to the holder that the daily Volume Weighted Average Price of the Company’s common stock was at least $4.00 for twenty consecutive trading days and the average daily volume of trades of the Company’s common stock during the twenty trading days was at least 150,000 shares.
On December 4, 2020, the loan was modified and increased by $500,000. The maturity date of the loan was extended to August 1, 2023. All other provisions of the original loan remain the same.
Sale of Common Stock and Warrants
Currently the company has 7,666,650 warrants issued and outstanding with exercise prices ranging from $1.00 to $1.50 and expiration dates ranging from October 21, 2021 to August 2, 2024 associated with transactions prior to October 1, 2019.
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we did not issue stock for services.
During the year ended September 30, 2020, we issued 191,490 shares of stock for services valued $90,000.
Contractual obligations
The Company leases land under an operating lease commencing October 17, 2016, for an initial term of fifty (50) years. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for four (4) additional ten (10) year periods. The lease is a triple net lease, with the Company paying all real estate taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance. The lease payments are the greater of (a) $30,000 per month; (b) $0.38 per square foot per month of any structure built on the property; or (c) 1.5% of all gross monthly sales of products sold by the Company, any assignee of the Company, or any subtenant of the Company. The Company received a credit for the $925,000 paid towards the purchase price of the land in the form of discounted lease payments. For the initial fifty (50) year term of the lease, the lease payments are reduced by $1,542 each month.
Analysis of Cash Flows
During the year ended September 30, 2021, cash flows used in operations were $275,153 as compared to net cash flows provided by operations of $518,333 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the collection of an arbitration award and timing of working capital payments and stock-based compensation during the year ended September 30, 2020.
Cash flows used in investing activities were $58,637 for the year ended September 30, 2021, consisting primarily of additions to construction in progress. Cash flows used in investing activities was $357,236 for the year ended September 30, 2020, consisting primarily of additions to property, plant and equipment.
Cash flows provided by financing activities were $847,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, consisting primarily of proceeds from note payable and the exercise of warrants, partially offset by payments on notes payable. Cash flows used by financing activities was $1,260,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020, consisting primarily of payments on notes payable, partially offset by proceeds from note payable.
Going concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $19,585,445 and $18,722,552 at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and had a net loss of $862,893 for the year ended September 30, 2021.
Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement the Company’s business plan and generate additional revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate additional revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to further implement its business plan and generate additional revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Trends
The factors that will most significantly affect our future operating results, liquidity and capital resources will be:
●
Government regulation of the cannabis industry;
●
Revision of Federal banking regulations for the cannabis industry; and
●
Legalization of the use of cannabi for medical or recreational use in other states.
Other than the foregoing, we do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material impact on:
●
revenues or expenses;
●
any material increase or decrease in liquidity; or
●
expected sources and uses of cash.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recent accounting pronouncements which may be applicable to us are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this report.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our significant accounting policies are set forth below. We have consistently applied these policies in all material respects.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates and assumptions made by management are valuation of equity instruments, deferred tax asset valuation and allowance and collectability of long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates as the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposit accounts and temporary cash investments with maturities of ninety days or less at the date of purchase.
Income Taxes
In accordance with ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. The liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the consolidated financial statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities have been adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
We expect to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a "more-likely-than-not" threshold, the amount to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had no uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative expenses. We currently have no federal or state tax examinations nor have we had any federal or state examinations since our inception. To date, we have not incurred any interest or tax penalties.
For federal tax purposes, our 2018 through 2020 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the normal three-year statute of limitations.
Concentration of Credit Risks and Significant Customers
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, notes receivables, deposits, and tenant receivables. We place our cash with high credit quality financial institutions. As of September 30, 2021, we had outstanding notes receivable of $84,749 and a tenant receivable of $258,854 with a related party.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 requires the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure concerning such fair value measurements.
ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2:
Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.
The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. We had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. We had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a recurring basis during the reporting periods. The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash, tenant and notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments. The long-term borrowings approximate fair value since the related rates of interest approximates current market rates.
Derivative Liabilities
We evaluate stock options, stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40, Derivative Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity. The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each consolidated balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. We determined that none of our financial instruments meet the criteria for derivative accounting as of September 30, 2021 and 2020.
Operating leases
Effective October 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842 Lease Accounting using the effective date method. Under the method, periods prior to adoption remain unchanged. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
Right of Use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability due to uncertainty of the payment amount and are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Under the available practical expedient, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets as both a lessee and lessor. Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy on all classes of underlying assets, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less).
Long-lived assets
Our long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of the Topic ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. We test for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairment evaluations involve management's estimates on asset useful lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management which could have a material effect on our reporting results and financial positions. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. There were no impairment losses recognized for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment begins in the month following the month when the asset is placed into service and is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives range from three to twenty years.
Non-Cash Equity Transactions
Shares of equity instruments issued for noncash consideration are recorded at the estimated fair market value of the consideration granted based on the estimated fair market value of the equity instrument, or at the estimated fair market value of the goods or services received, whichever is more readily determinable.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for share-based awards to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. Under this guidance, stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line attribute method. Share-based awards to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASU 2018-07 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-based Payment Accounting, which aligns the accounting for nonemployee share-based payments with accounting of share-based payments to employees,
Related Parties
A party is considered to be related to us if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. Related parties also include our principal owners, our management, members of the immediate families of our principal owners and our management and other parties with which we may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties, or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests, is also a related party.
Revenue Recognition
Effective October 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under the new standard, we recognize revenues when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of a contract with a customer exists, (ii) identifiable performance obligations under the contract exist, (iii) the transaction price is determinable for each performance obligation, (iv) the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation, and (v) when the performance obligations are satisfied. Currently, we derive all of our revenues from property leases. Property leases are not within the scope of ASC 606.
Property lease revenue is earned through annual leases for facilities used in agricultural/manufacturing activities and the Company records revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of these leases. Property lease revenues from these sources are recurring on an annual basis. Unearned property lease revenues were $0 at both September 30, 2021 and 2020.
The Company also receives a revenue participation fee which is considered a variable payment and thus is recorded in the period earned in accordance with ASC 842.
Advertising Expense
Advertising, promotional and selling expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses, and promotional activity expenses. Expenses are recognized when incurred.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist of professional service fees, rent and utility expenses, meals, travel and entertainment expenses, and other general and administrative overhead costs. Expenses are recognized when incurred.
Loss per Share
We compute net loss per share in accordance with the ASC Topic 260. The ASC specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for loss per share for entities with publicly held common stock.
Basic loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issuable upon the exercise of equity instruments such as warrants and options were not included in the loss per share calculations for 2021 and 2020 because the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of September 30, 2021, we did not have any off-consolidated balance sheet arrangements.
