Liquidity and Capital Resources
Primary sources of liquidity since the Company became a “public shell” following the March 31, 2004 Net Asset Sale have been cash balances that have been used to pay administrative expenses. Operating expenses of the Company have been funded with $30,000 of available cash retained from the Net Asset Sale and from $50,000 of cash generated by the sale of additional shares of common stock to Dorman Industries on April 1, 2004. Subsequent thereto, the Company sold shares of unregistered securities through private placement in the following amounts:
As reflected in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2020, cash totals $203. Based on such balance and management’s forecast of activity levels during the period that it may remain a “public shell” corporation, management will have to again sell through private placement a number of additional shares of common stock to generate sufficient cash to pay its current liabilities and its administrative expenses as such expenses become due in 2021. The Company has not identified as yet potential acquisition candidates, the acquisition of which would mean that the Company would cease being a “public shell” and begin operating activities.
While it is the Company’s objective to ultimately be able to use the securities of the Company as a currency in the acquisition of portfolio businesses, the initial acquisitions of portfolio businesses may require the Company to be infused with additional capital thereby diluting the Company’s shareholders, including Dorman Industries to the extent that it does not participate in the capital infusion.
