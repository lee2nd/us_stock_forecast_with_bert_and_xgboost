Overview
MassRoots, Inc. was formed in April 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry. In March 2021, we relaunched our website, MassRoots.com, which aims to enable cannabis consumers to find the best products, connect with other enthusiasts, and deliver fresh content that both delights and informs our audience. Additionally, we plan to monetize our YouTube Channel, which has 273,000 subscribers, through product placements and sponsorships. Management believes that our YouTube Channel has one of the largest followings in the regulated cannabis industry while our Instagram account is followed by 378,000 users.
Competitors
We compete with other cannabis information platforms such as WeedMaps and Leafly, which provide information with respect to dispensary locations, strain information, and news relating to the cannabis industry.
Blockchain Technology
In December 2017, we formed MassRoots Blockchain Technologies, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, to explore how blockchain technology may be utilized in the cannabis industry.

Results of Operations For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Since inception on April 26, 2013, and during the year ended December 31, 2020, our business operations have been primarily focused developing our mobile applications, web platform and blockchain features for our products, and increasing our User-base.
Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $6,964 in revenues, as compared to $23,703 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $16,739. This decrease is primarily related to service interruptions on our platform and downsizing of our sales and corporate staff.
Operating Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our operating expenses were $1,167,175 and $3,469,139, respectively, a decrease of $2,301,964. The decrease was mainly attributed to stock-based compensation to our employees and key consultants which, for 2020, was $0 as compared to $222,700 for 2019, a non-cash decrease of $222,700. In addition, impairment expense decreased by $196,315 as impairment expense was $0 in 2020 as compared to $196,315 in 2019, which was mainly attributed to impairment expenses associated with our business portal. There was an decrease in payroll and related expenses of $853,064 as payroll and related expenses were $303,850 for 2020 as compared to $1,156,914 for the same period in 2019, which was the result of a decrease in our labor force. Advertising expense increased by $29,197 to $58,961 for 2020 as compared to $29,764 for 2019 due to a re-focus on the Company’s YouTube channnel. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded amortization of software costs of $0 and $38,549, respectively.
Our other general and administrative expenses decreased to $803,081 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,460,867 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $657,786. This decrease was mainly attributed to the following:
● Consulting and accounting expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $355,963 from $452,477 during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily a result of us having fewer consulting projects with firms in fiscal year 2020.
● Independent contractor expenses decreased from $284,328 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $51,442 during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to us engaging fewer individual consultants.
● Travel and related expenses decreased to $3,372 during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $21,506 during the year ended December 31, 2019. This was a result of our team attending fewer conferences and meetings with cannabis related businesses in 2020 as compared to 2019.
The decrease of these expenditures resulted in our total operating expenses declining to $1,167,175 during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3,469,139 during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2,301,964.
Loss from Operations
Our loss from operations decreased $2,285,225 to $1,160,211 during the year ended December 31, 2020, from $3,445,436 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other (Expense)
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred other (expense) of $(13,550,249), as compared to $(30,823,476) for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $17,273,227. This decrease is primarily due to a gain of the forgiveness of debt of $250,000 and a gain on settlement of convertible notes payable and accrued interest, warrants and accounts payable of $162,109,131 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s derivative liability for authorized shares shortfall expense increased by $(151,398,053) to $(170,319,590) in fiscal year 2020 from ($18,921,537) during fiscal year 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,037,843 and $1,797,227, respectively. The decrease in 2020 resulted primarily from the net loss of $14,710,460, partially offset by non-cash items including derivative liability for authorized shares shortfall of $170,319,590, gain on settlement of convertible notes payable and accrued interest, warrants and accounts payable of $162,109,131, interest and amortization of debt discount of $5,139,321, change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $451,351, gain on forgiveness of debt of $250,000 and gain on conversion of convertible notes payable of $882, as well as an increase in accrued payroll and related expenses of $140,005 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $77,520. The decrease in 2019 resulted primarily from the net loss of $34,268,912, partially offset by non-cash items including derivative liability for authorized shares shortfall of $18,921,537, preferred stock issuance costs of $5,585,594, interest and amortization of debt discount of $4,716,970, change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $685,415, and loss on conversion of convertible notes payable of $603,529, as well as an increase in accrued payroll and related expenses of $732,027 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $557,360.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,038,208 and $1,677,798, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these funds came mainly from the sale of Series X Preferred Stock amounting to $321,000, proceeds from issuance of convertible debt of $637,000, proceeds from issuance of non-convertible notes payable of $82,911, proceeds from the issuance of a $50,000 PPP loan, offset by repayment of advances in the amount of $3,009, repayment of non-convertible notes in the amount of $39,641, and the repayment of $13,749 in bank overdrafts. Comparatively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, these funds came mainly from the sale of Series B Preferred Stock and warrants amounting to $1,407,500, proceeds from issuance of convertible debt of $549,000 and proceeds from issuance of non-convertible notes payable of $175,000, offset by repayment of advances in the amount of $595,000.
Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash on hand of $1,485. We currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital.
We are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations, and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs; however, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
Fundraising
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received proceeds of $637,000, $132,911, and $321,000 from the issuance of convertible notes, non-convertible notes, and Series X preferred shares, respectively.
Required Capital over the Next Fiscal Year
We do not believe that we have sufficient capital to become cash-flow positive from operations. We expect that we will need to raise additional funds to continue to fund operations.
We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain adequate capital to fund operating losses until we generate adequate cash flows from operations to fund our operating costs and obligations. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations.
We depend upon our ability to secure equity and/or debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which simplifies the guidance on accounting for convertible debt instruments by removing the separation models for: (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature; and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, the Company will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature in such debt. Instead, we will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt, unless certain other conditions are met. We expect the elimination of these models will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for the Company’s convertible instruments falling under the scope of those models before the adoption of ASU 2020-06. Also, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The provisions of ASU 2020-06 are applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement” (“ASU 2018-13”). ASU 2018-13 removes certain disclosure requirements, including the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 also adds disclosure requirements, including changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. ASU 2018-13 became effective for us on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
There are other various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
