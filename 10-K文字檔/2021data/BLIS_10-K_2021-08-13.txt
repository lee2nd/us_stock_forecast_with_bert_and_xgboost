Liquidity and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements
At April 30, 2021, the Company had cash of $197,761. Furthermore, the Company had working capital of $91,841 as compared to a working capital deficit of $120,675 at April 30, 2020. The Company’s working capital balance increased in 2021 due to the receipt of financing from two convertible promissory notes.
During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company used $368,872 of cash in operating activities. This is a decrease compared to $444,782 used in 2020. This decrease is due to a decrease in net loss and accounts payable, an increase in stock based compensation, depreciation and other expenses associated with the expansion of the business.
During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company did not use any cash in investing activities. This is a decrease compared to the year ended April 30, 2020 during which the Company used $60,390 of cash in investing activities. In 2020 the Company purchased a diving vessel and a magnetometer which were capitalized on the balance sheet as fixed assets.
During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company had $559,955 of cash from financing activities from the sale of stock and an increase in short term loans. This was an increase compared to the $511,850 of cash from financing activities in 2020.
As of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. At April 30, 2021, the Company’s working capital was $91,841. The Company is in immediate need of further working capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. Based on its historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than six months from August 12, 2021.
The Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent auditors for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020 raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditors believe, based on our financial results as of April 30, 2021, that such results raised substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is highly likely that all capital invested in the Company will be lost.
Additionally, it is possible that the Company may face additional challenges in obtaining financing due to COVID-19’s effects on the general economy and the capital markets. If the Company is not able to obtain financing due to COVID-19 then it is highly likely it will be forced to cease operations and shut down its business, which would likely result in a complete loss of all capital invested in the Company.
Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company’s success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement its business plan and impede the speed of its operations.
Limited operating history; need for additional capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated very negligible revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
