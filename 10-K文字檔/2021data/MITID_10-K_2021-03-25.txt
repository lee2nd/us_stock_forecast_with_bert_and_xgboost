ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.
We are working to open primary care clinics around the US that are located in residential centers and leverage the expertise, training and license of Nurse Practitioners. We are focusing on wellness as a core of the practice. Mitesco’s mission is to increase convenience and access to care, improve the quality of care, and reduce its cost. Technology is a key part to our approach to deliver on thee three goals. We recognize the essential nature of the clinician client relationship and its importance to achieving these superior outcomes. Our view is that technology must enhance these human interactions, not operate independently. As such, we are seeking innovative technologies that enable both consumers and clinicians to achieve more convenient and better outcomes with greater efficiency.
We have opened our flagship primary care clinic in North East Minneapolis, MN. We plan to open an additional 5 to 7 clinics in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota and then continue expansion in the Denver, Colorado area. We target to open clinic in residential concentrations of population to enhance the convenience, especially timely due to the changes in community travel patterns resulting from the pandemic. Our clinicians use both telehealth (virtual) and in-person visits to treat and coach the clients along their journey to better health and quality of life. Our clinics are led by Nurse Practitioners that use their license, extensive training, expertise and empathy to help people remain stable or improve their health. We emphasize wellness, beginning with a client‘s co-developed plan that identifies from where a person is starting and constructs a plan for how they can achieve their goals. The practice uses an integrated health approach that includes an assessment of both the individual’s behavioral and physical health and combines this with their activation level and their goals. The clinic offers wellness coaching, behavioral health care, episodic care, dermatologic services, and supplements. We seek to care for the whole person’s needs.
Like the first clinic, we seek to locate clinics convenient to residential centers. In pursuit of this approach, we will continue to expand our relationship with Lennar Corporation and other developers. Already, our clinic is being viewed as an amenity for the high-rise development in which we are located. We plan to mirror this approach within the two Lennar locations with which we have signed letters of intent to build clinics in these residential developments in Denver. By locating in in close proximity we expect to be able to build the client panel more quickly than typical for primary care practices.
Additionally, we have implemented a corporate structure that we believe allows us to expand into international markets. We have a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, Acelerar Healthcare Holdings, Ltd. We intend to use this location as a base for European operations. In the European community the investment in healthcare technology has been significant. In many cases, even more robust than in the North American markets. We believe that as a result of expected low economic growth in the European community, a number of technology businesses based there may become our targets for acquisition at attractive valuations. We believe that these businesses may benefit from the larger markets found in North America and elsewhere in the world.
We also see the European community as an opportunity for capital as we expand our business. The interest rates in this area of the world are currently very low or even at zero. As such, raising funds in the European market may prove attractive when compared to local alternatives. Further, there are equity and debt markets based in Europe that may provide liquidity to our investors, should we be able to list and trade our financial instruments in those marketplaces. We may seek a dual listing for our common stock to trade there. We believe this avenue may increase both the size and liquidity of the shareholder base.
Results of Operations
The following period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of results for the current period of any future periods. Further, as a result of any acquisitions of other businesses, and any additional pharmacy acquisitions or other such transactions we may pursue, we may experience large expenditures specific to the transactions that are not incident to our operations.

Business Development Agreement
On March 2, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with four senior executives from Minute Clinic James Woodburn, Kevin Lee Smith, Michael Howe and Rebecca Hafner-Fogarty ( the “Sellers”) with the skills and know-how to assist the Company in the establishment of a series of clinics utilizing nurse practitioners and telemedicine technology in States where full practice authority for nurse practitioners is supported (the “Business Development Agreement”). We issued 4,800 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to these individuals as compensation. We valued the 4,800 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at $71,558 or approximately $14.91 per share based upon an analysis performed by an independent valuation consultant. Subsequent to year end the Company cancelled the Series A Preferred Shares issued in this transaction and instead issued a total of 600,000 shares of restricted stock to satisfy this obligation.
Critical Accounting Policies
We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve the use of more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and any changes in the assumptions used in making the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606. The impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to our financial statements and there was no adjustment to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2018.
Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
●
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
●
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
●
Determination of the transaction price;
●
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
●
Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation costs to employees under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Under FASB ASC 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation cost for stock options are estimated at the grant date based on each option’s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model. Share-based compensation arrangements may include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.
Equity instruments issued to other than employees are recorded pursuant to the guidance contained in ASU 2018-07 (“ASU 2018-07”), Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplified the accounting for share-based payments granted to non-employees for goods and services. Under the ASU 2018-07, most of the guidance on such payments to non-employees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees.
Common Stock Purchase Warrants
The Company accounts for common stock purchase warrants in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“ASC 815”). As is consistent with its handling of stock compensation and embedded derivative instruments, the Company’s cost for stock warrants is estimated at the grant date based on each warrant’s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model value method for valuing the impact of the expense associated with these warrants. All warrants for the Company have been canceled at this time.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our actual current tax liabilities and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the balance sheet. We must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, the impact will be included in income tax expense in the statement of operations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet, if material.
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets, estimated contingent consideration payments and pre-acquisition contingencies. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
●future expected cash flows from product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies and patents
●discount rates utilized in valuation estimates
●Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
Additionally, any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes in our estimates of relevant revenue or other targets, will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change. A change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration or the occurrence of events that cause results to differ from our estimates or assumptions could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations or cash flows in the period of the change in the estimate.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Plan of Operations
We intend to acquire a series of early-stage companies in the healthcare industry into a portfolio using a “incubator” model. These will feature proven technology and services that generally has not yet scaled to size and needs resources to do so. We expect that these will be both domestic, and international and will see growth primarily from expanded marketing into new marketplaces. There is a small universe of healthcare providers. For all these people to get the services and products they need, the cost must come down, the quality must improve and access to care must increase. Core to achieving these three targets are:
1)
As efficiency and accuracy of information-sharing for an individual’s healthcare status, diagnostics and maintenance improves, the correct care will be delivered the first time and, therefore, reduce costs;
2)
Innovative technology needs to be developed and funded in order to improve care quality to treat people with a fewer number of interactions within the health care system;
3)
Increasing the scope of care for a provider, allowing them to serve up to their full training, expertise and license, and then make those services available via in-person visits, by phone, by text, by email and by video, all to increase access to services with the least amount of delay.
We are seeing many excellent examples of how technology can improve healthcare:
●
Empowering people to manage their own care so that they need fewer resources from the shrinking pool of healthcare professionals;
●
Gathering and sharing data about a person’s healthcare needs more effectively among the relevant healthcare professionals and suppliers;
●
Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics to allow the healthcare professionals to work more effectively, spreading their talents across a larger pool of those who need their insights.
Many available innovative healthcare technology companies are small. Recently founded startups lack marketing and operational knowledge to grow. We believe our technology can be applicable, but are short in teams who can scale, integrate and deploy the new technology and services. This is our opportunity.
We have assembled a team with deep experience in the application of healthcare, technology and service, to find, evaluate, integrate and grow selected businesses that fit our demanding requirements. First, they must have proof of results; tangible and measurable. Second, their technology or services must be appropriate for a segment of the population that is sizeable, and in many cases, where the population is underserved. Lastly, the companies must show an ability to grow their capabilities and their market reach, including geographically. Integrated solutions are most always more effective than those that can only operate stand-alone.
We are seeking to start with 5 or 6 in the near term and create sufficient cash flows to support both our public company overhead, and to fund operations and growth from acquired businesses.
All of our plans are contingent on recruiting sufficient capital to provide for both our public company overhead, and to fund the acquisitions and growth needs of the target acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our funding efforts, the plans may stall, and even the limited overhead of the Company may require reductions.
Recent Developments
Change in Headquarters
On January 30, 2020 we announced a change in our corporate headquarters from Atlanta, Georgia to Denver, Colorado. In February 2021 the Company relocated its headquarters to Minneapolis, Minnesota to be closer to its clinic operations.

The 2020 Directors Advisory Agreement
On December 30, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved Director Advisory Agreements for each Company Director (each an “Agreement,” collectively the “Agreements”). Each Agreement is for one (1) year and is effective immediately.
Each Agreement has three (3) components: (i) per the Agreement, each Director shall receive a $2,500 per month stipend, except that in any month in which there is a physical meeting of all of the Board of Directors it shall be $5,000. All fees and stipends will accrue until the Company has sufficient funding to pay it in total, of which $1,000 of the stipend will get priority treatment, along with other conventional payroll obligations; (ii) each Director will receive a restricted stock allocation of 1 million shares that shall be immediately issued to the Director on his appointment (or to his assignee(s)) with certain reverse vesting provisions subject to the Directors continued standing as a Board member, such that: 1/6th of the shares shall be fully vested within 180 days, 1/6th shall be fully vested as of 6 months, 1/6th shall be fully vested as of 12 months, 1/6th shall fully vest as of 24 months, 1/6th shall fully vest as of 30 months and 1/6th shall fully vest as of 36 months. If the Director has remained a member of the Board continuously through 36 months, the individual shall own 1 million shares of restricted stock with no further reverse vesting provisions. The restricted common stock issuances are considered appropriate additional annual compensation for active Board duties. All share grants will be subject to Rule 144 and will have a six-month holding period according to the Securities Act. If the Director leaves the Board during this 6-month holding period, then any shares not previously relieved of the reverse vesting provisions will be rescinded. The Company retains the right to issue these shares via a Stock Option program upon filing of the S-8 rather than issue restricted stock.
The Agreements further provide that any of the Directors may be removed on a vote of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors, as well as the terms of the Company's Bylaws, as amended, Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and under the Delaware General Corporate Law (DGCL).

We issued 4,800 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to these individuals as compensation.
