Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for neurotology. We pioneered the application of drug delivery technology to the ear in order to develop products that achieve sustained drug exposure from a single local administration. This approach is covered by a broad patent estate and has been utilized to develop a pipeline of product candidates including three clinical-stage programs (OTIVIDEX for Ménière’s disease, OTO-313 for tinnitus, and OTO-413 for hearing loss) as well as several preclinical development programs including a gene therapy collaboration targeting the most common form of congenital hearing loss. We estimate, based on an external market report commissioned by us, that approximately 39 million patients in the United States suffer from the hearing and balance disorders that we are targeting in our clinical and preclinical programs, including moderate or severe vertigo (approximately 11 million), tinnitus (approximately 8 million) or hearing loss (approximately over 20 million). We also developed, registered and commercialized in the United States an otic antibiotic called OTIPRIO that is being marketed by a co-promotion partner, ALK.
OTIVIDEX is a sustained-exposure formulation of the steroid dexamethasone in development for the treatment of Ménière’s disease. Two Phase 3 trials in Ménière’s disease patients were completed in the second half of 2017. The AVERTS-2 trial, conducted in Europe, achieved its primary endpoint (p value = 0.029), while the AVERTS-1 trial, conducted in the United States, did not (p value = 0.62). Based on a Type C meeting with the FDA, we believe that one additional successful pivotal trial is sufficient to support the United States registration of OTIVIDEX in Ménière’s disease. We have completed enrollment in such additional Phase 3 trial with top-line results expected by the end of February 2021.
OTO-313 is a sustained-exposure formulation of gacyclidine, a potent and selective NMDA receptor antagonist, in development for the treatment of tinnitus. In July 2020, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OTO-313 in patients with persistent tinnitus of at least moderate severity. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for OTO-313 in the first quarter of 2021, with top-line results expected in mid-2022.
OTO-413 is a sustained-exposure formulation of BDNF in development for the repair of cochlear synaptopathy, an underlying pathology in age-related and noise-induced hearing loss. In December 2020, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OTO-413, demonstrating that a single intratympanic injection of OTO-413 was well-tolerated and showed therapeutic activity across multiple speech-in-noise hearing tests. We plan to initiate an expansion of the Phase 1/2 trial in the second quarter of 2021 to evaluate a refined study protocol in additional hearing loss patients, with top-line results expected in mid-2022.
We also have multiple preclinical stage programs addressing additional hearing loss pathologies including a gene therapy for treatment of congenital hearing loss (OTO-825), an otoprotectant for prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss (OTO-510), and a hair cell repair and regeneration program for treatment of severe hearing loss (OTO-6XX). In October 2019, we entered into a strategic collaboration with AGTC to co-develop and co-commercialize an AAV-based gene therapy to restore hearing in patients with congenital hearing loss caused by a mutation in the GJB2 gene. In July 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyorin that provides us with exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a novel compound from Kyorin for our OTO-6XX program.
In addition, we developed, received FDA approval for and commercially launched OTIPRIO (ciprofloxacin otic suspension) for use during TTP surgery in pediatric patients. OTIPRIO was also approved by the FDA for the
treatment of AOE. In June 2020, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with ALK to support the promotion of OTIPRIO for the treatment of AOE in physician offices in the United States, which was amended in October 2020 to include promotion of OTIPRIO for use during TTP surgery in pediatric patients.
We have a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2008, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to developing and commercializing OTIPRIO, developing our current product candidates, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. In July 2020, we sold in a public offering 17,275,000 shares of our common stock, which includes the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, and we sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,000,000 shares of our common stock for $64.2 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $86.3 million and an outstanding debt balance of $15.2 million.
We have never been profitable, and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $504.6 million. Our net losses were $44.7 million, $44.7 million and $50.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 2019 and 2018, respectively. Substantially all our net losses have resulted from research and development expenses related to our clinical trials and product development activities, commercialization expenses to launch OTIPRIO in the U.S. market, and other general and administrative expenses.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop, seek regulatory approval, and, if approved, commercialize our product candidates. In the near term, we anticipate our expenses will continue to be substantial as we:
•
conduct clinical development of OTIVIDEX, OTO-313 and OTO-413;
•
conduct nonclinical development of OTO-825, OTO-510 and OTO-6XX;
•
contract to manufacture our product candidates;
•
evaluate opportunities for development of additional product candidates;
•
maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional staff as necessary to execute our product development plan; and
•
operate as a public company.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When additional financing is required, we anticipate we will seek funding through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration arrangements. We may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to raise capital could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies.
In November 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents of the University of California (UC). Under the license agreement, UC granted us an exclusive license under their rights to patents and applications that are co-developed and co-owned with us for the treatment of human otic diseases. Our financial obligations under the license agreement include development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $2.7 million per licensed product, of which $1.9 million has been paid for OTIPRIO, $0.8 million has been paid for OTIVIDEX, $0.4 million has been paid for OTO-413, and $0.1 million has been paid for OTO-311 (but such milestone payments are reduced by 75% for any orphan indication product), and a low single-digit royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of licensed products. In addition, for each sublicense we grant we are obligated to pay UC a fixed percentage of all royalties as well as a sliding-scale percentage of non-royalty sublicense fees received by us under such sublicense, with such percentage depending on the licensed product’s stage of development when sublicensed to such third party. We have the right to offset a certain amount of third-party royalties, milestone fees or sublicense fees against the foregoing financial obligations, provided such third-party royalties or fees are paid by us in consideration for intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize a licensed product.
In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with DURECT Corporation (Durect), as part of an asset transfer agreement between us and IncuMed LLC, an affiliate of the NeuroSystec Corporation. Under this license agreement, Durect granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under Durect’s rights to certain patents and applications covering our OTO-313 product candidate, as well as certain related know-how. Under this license agreement and the asset transfer agreement, we are obligated to make one-time milestone payments of up to $7.5 million for the first licensed product. Upon commercializing a licensed product, we are obligated to pay Durect tiered, low single-digit royalties on annual net sales by us or our affiliates or sublicensees of the licensed products, and we have the right to offset a certain amount of third-party license fees or royalties against such royalty payments to Durect. In addition, each sublicense we grant to a third party is subject to payment to Durect of a low double-digit percentage of all non-royalty payments we receive under such sublicense. Additionally, we are also obligated to pay the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), on behalf of Durect, for a low single-digit royalty payment on net sales by us or our affiliates or sublicensees upon commercialization of the licensed product. The foregoing royalty payment obligation to Durect would continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until expiration or determination of invalidity of the last valid claim within the licensed patents that cover the licensed product, and the payment obligation to INSERM would continue so long as Durect’s license from INSERM remains in effect.
Given the unprecedented and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the progression and ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business operations. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trials, including developing processes to ensure the integrity of data collection from enrolled patients and supporting the increasing number of sites able to enroll new patients, among other activity. Nonetheless, we do not know the full extent of potential future delays or impacts on our business operations, our preclinical programs and clinical trials, healthcare systems, our financial condition, or the global economy as a whole resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
In December 2015, OTIPRIO was approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing TTP surgery. In March 2016, we began sales of OTIPRIO in the United States to our network of specialty distributors who fill orders received from hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers who are the primary end user customers of OTIPRIO for use during TTP surgery. We also entered into co-promotion partnerships to support the promotion of OTIPRIO for the treatment of AOE in physician offices and in October 2020 amended the current co-promotion agreement with ALK to include promotion of OTIPRIO for use during TTP surgery in pediatric patients.
We recognize revenue on sales of OTIPRIO upon delivery to our distributors. Product sales are recorded net of estimated chargebacks, government rebates and distributor fees.
Prior to March 2016 we had not generated revenue. We do not expect to generate any revenue from any of our product candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our products or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties.
Operating Expenses
Cost of product sales
Cost of product sales consists primarily of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing of OTIPRIO, including third-party manufacturing costs, allocation of overhead costs and royalty payments based on OTIPRIO sales.
Research and development expenses
Our research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.
Our research and development expenses include:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;
•
external development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as fees paid to CROs in connection with nonclinical studies and clinical trials, costs of acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data such as investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis, and fees paid to consultants;
•
costs to acquire, develop and manufacture clinical trial materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;
•
payments related to licensed product candidates and technologies;
•
costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements; and
•
facilities expenses which include allocated expenses for amortization of ROU assets, depreciation and other overhead expenses, and direct costs for laboratory and other supplies.
We expense our internal and third-party research and development expenses as incurred.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses (in thousands):
We expect our research and development expenses to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through their respective development programs. The process of conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The probability of success will be affected by numerous factors, including nonclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We are responsible for all of the research and development costs for our programs.
Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each of our clinical development programs and are difficult to predict. We therefore cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the costs we will incur in connection with development of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future clinical trials, regulatory developments, and our ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidate’s commercial potential. We may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to complete the development of and, if approved, commercialize, our product candidates. We may enter into collaborative agreements in the future in order to conduct clinical trials and gain regulatory approval of our product candidates, particularly in markets outside of the United States. We cannot forecast which programs or product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and overall capital requirements.
The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a program owing to the following:
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
changes in regulatory and legal requirements for clinical trials;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient follow-up;
•
the phase of development of the product candidate;
•
the manufacturing process and complexity of, expiration of, and amount of the drug product required for the clinical trials;
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate; and
•
the impacts of COVID-19.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense, as well as other related costs for our employees and consultants in executive, administrative, finance and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development, costs associated with prosecuting and maintaining our patent portfolio and corporate legal expenses, costs required for public company activities and infrastructure necessary for the general conduct of our business, and OTIPRIO product support expenses and profit-sharing fees payable to our co-promotion partners, which are reduced by payments received from them.
We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to be substantial as we support development of our product candidates, and as we incur ongoing expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premiums, and investor relations-related expenses.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) primarily consists of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and interest expense related to our long-term debt and finance leases.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to net product sales, accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on our historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Clinical Trial Expense Accruals
We estimate expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, CROs and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts vary and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided.
We record clinical trial expenses in the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. We accrue for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We estimate accruals through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress of trials. During the course of a clinical trial, we may adjust our clinical accruals if actual results differ from our estimates. We estimate accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Our clinical trial accruals are dependent upon accurate reporting by CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to differ materially from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 there were no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials.
Stock-based Compensation
We recognize non-cash expense for the fair value of all stock options and other share-based awards. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options, using the single-option award approach and straight-line attribution method. For options granted to employees and directors, we recognize the resulting fair value as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each respective stock option, generally four years.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.
Other Information
Net Operating Loss and Research and Development Tax Credit Carryforwards
As of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal and state NOLs of approximately $382.8 million and $124.8 million, respectively. Of the federal NOLs, approximately $142.2 million were generated after January 1, 2018, and therefore do not expire. Our U.S. federal and state NOLs will expire in various years beginning in 2030, if not utilized. Under the 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), as modified by the CARES Act, the deductibility of our federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 will be limited to 80% of taxable income in such years. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards expire in various years beginning in 2030, if not utilized. The California research credit will carry forward indefinitely. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change federal NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its future post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5% shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We believe we have experienced certain ownership changes in the past
and have reduced our deferred tax assets related to NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards accordingly. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced additional ownership changes, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn in the event that we attain profitability. Any such limitations on the ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in the event that we attain profitability.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.
Reduced Reporting Requirements
We are a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. For as long as we remain a “smaller reporting company,” we are permitted and intend to continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “smaller reporting companies.” These exemptions include:
•
being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” disclosure; and
•
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
Additionally, we intend to rely on certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements available to us as a non-accelerated filer, including those relating to providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Research and development expenses. The decrease of $4.8 million in research and development expenses resulted from a number of activities including: (i) a decrease of $3.3 million in OTIVIDEX clinical trial and development costs primarily due to lower activity during 2020 as a result of COVID-19 related delays; (ii) a decrease of $2.2 million in development costs for our OTO-413 hearing loss program due to the completion of manufacturing and nonclinical studies in 2019, partially offset by an increase in clinical trial and development costs in 2020; and (iii) a decrease of $1.4 million in OTO-313 clinical trial and development costs primarily due to the completion of enrollment in the quarter ended March 31, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million in personnel costs and other operating expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase of $2.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase of $1.9 million in professional services due to the discontinuation of cost reimbursement received from our OTIPRIO co-promotion partners in 2019 and an increase of $1.0 million in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and other operating expenses.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
The following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
Research and development expenses. The increase of $1.0 million in research and development expenses resulted from a number of activities including: (i) a $2.5 million increase in OTIVIDEX clinical trial and development costs related to the Phase 3 trial initiated in the third quarter of 2018; (ii) a $0.7 million increase in OTO-313 clinical trial and development costs related to the Phase 1/2 trial initiated in the second quarter of 2019; and (iii) an increase of $0.5 million in other research and development costs, including professional services. These increases were partially offset by: (i) a decrease of $0.7 million in clinical trial and development costs for our OTO-413 hearing loss program; and (ii) a $2.0 million net decrease in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense associated with the Option Exchange in 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease of $8.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses was a result of a $5.3 million reduction in personnel costs, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense associated with the Option Exchange in 2018, and a $3.0 million decrease in outside service expense as a result of OTIPRIO cost reimbursement recognized from our co-promotion partners in 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $504.6 million and we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more public or private equity or debt financings, or other sources such as potential collaboration arrangements.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $86.3 million. We have principally financed our operations through sales and issuances of our equity securities, debt financing as well as private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible notes.
The following table sets forth a summary of the primary sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
Operating activities. The primary uses of cash were to fund increased levels of development activities for our product candidates and to support the commercialization of OTIPRIO. We expect to continue the use of cash for development of our product candidates for the foreseeable future.
Net cash used in operating activities was $38.9 million in 2020 compared to $36.9 million in 2019. The increase in the utilization of cash was primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses compared to an increase in the
prior year. Net cash used in operating activities was $36.9 million in 2019 compared to $38.4 million in 2018. The decrease in the utilization of cash was primarily due to a decrease in operating losses compared to the prior year.
Investing activities. The primary source of cash from investing activities was from maturities of short-term investments and the primary use of cash from investing activities was for purchases of short-term investments and capital expenditures.
Net cash used in investing activities was $20.2 million in 2020 compared to net cash provided of $28.3 million in 2019 and net cash provided of $38.0 million in 2018. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to net maturities of short-term investments used to fund operations.
Financing activities. The primary source of net cash provided by financing activities was net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $64.7 million in 2020 compared to $0.2 million in 2019 and $15.2 million in 2018. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 consisted of $64.2 million related to the issuance of common stock and pre-funded warrants and $0.5 million in net proceeds for shares issued for stock option exercises and under our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 consisted of $0.2 million in net proceeds for shares issued for stock option exercises and under our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of net proceeds of $14.8 million from a loan and $0.4 million in net proceeds for shares issued for stock option exercises and under our employee stock purchase plan.
At the Market Offering Program
In August 2019, we entered into a sales agreement (Sales Agreement) with Cowen to sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $40.0 million, from time to time, through an “at the market” equity offering program under which Cowen will act as sales agent or principal. Under the Sales Agreement, we set the parameters for the sale of shares, including the number or dollar value of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made. The Sales Agreement provides that Cowen will be entitled to compensation for its services that will equal 3.0% of the gross sales price per share of all shares sold through Cowen under the Sales Agreement. The Sales Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the issuance and sale of placement shares equaling sales proceeds of $40.0 million and may be terminated earlier by either us or Cowen upon five days’ notice. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreement. Through December 31, 2020, we have not sold any shares under the Sales Agreement.
Term Loan
Oxford Loan
On December 31, 2018 (the Closing Date), we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC (the Loan Agreement). The Loan Agreement provides for a $15.0 million secured term loan credit facility (the Term Loan). The proceeds of the Term Loan may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. We have the right to prepay the Term Loan in whole or in part at any time, subject to a prepayment fee of 1.00%. Amounts prepaid or repaid under the Term Loan may not be reborrowed. The Term Loan was fully funded on the Closing Date and matures on December 1, 2023 (the Maturity Date). We paid a facility fee of 0.75% and customary closing fees on the Closing Date.
The Term Loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of 5.25% and the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal from time to time, plus 3.75% (9.0% as of December 31, 2020, the minimum interest rate). Interest on the Term Loan is payable monthly in arrears. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the terms of the Term Loan were amended to extend the interest-only period from 24 months to 36 months following the Closing Date, followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal and interest in arrears through the Maturity Date. The extension was accounted for as a modification, with no material effect on our financial statements or financial position. The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on December 1, 2023. The net outstanding Term Loan balance was $15.2 million as of December 31, 2020.
Upon repayment or acceleration of the Term Loan, a final payment fee equal to 4.00% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Term Loan is payable (the Final Payment). The Final Payment of $0.6 million, as well as the initial facility fee and all other direct fees and costs associated with the Loan Agreement, was recognized as a debt discount. The debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest method.
Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property and subject to certain other exceptions and limitations.
The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding compliance with applicable laws and regulations, reporting requirements, payment of taxes and other obligations, and maintenance of insurance. Further, subject to certain exceptions, the Loan Agreement contains customary negative covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, sell assets, allow a change of control to occur (if the Term Loan is not repaid), make acquisitions, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends or repurchase stock. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the lenders may declare all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the Loan Agreement immediately due and payable, increase the applicable rate of interest by 5.00%, and exercise the other rights and remedies provided for under the Loan Agreement and related loan documents. The events of default under the Loan Agreement include payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, material adverse changes, certain bankruptcy events, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, and judgment defaults.
Funding Requirements
We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we: (i) develop and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates OTIVIDEX, OTO-313 and OTO-413; and (ii) work to develop additional product candidates through research and development programs. We are subject to all the risks incident in the development of new therapeutic products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that include proceeds from our long-term debt will be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When additional financing is required, we anticipate that we will seek funding through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration arrangements. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any collaboration agreements we enter into may provide capital in the near-term but limit our potential cash flow and revenue in the future. Any of the foregoing could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.
Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:
•
the timing and costs of completing the remaining clinical development and obtaining regulatory approval for OTIVIDEX in Ménière’s disease;
•
the design, initiation, progress, size, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates, including OTO-313 and OTO-413;
•
the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect;
•
the revenue generated by OTIPRIO and our product candidates, if approved;
•
the costs related to manufacturing commercial supplies of OTIPRIO;
•
the timing and costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials, nonclinical studies and for commercial sale;
•
the cost of building and maintaining sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any products for which we may receive regulatory approval and commercialize, including related facilities expansion costs;
•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;
•
the potential acquisition and in-licensing of other technologies, products or assets;
•
the extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our in-license agreements and the timing of such payments;
•
the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;
•
the cost associated with legal and regulatory compliance;
•
our need to expand our development activities, including our need and ability to hire and adequately compensate additional employees;
•
the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the costs associated with being a public company;
•
the effect of competing technological and market developments; and
•
the cost of litigation, including potential patent litigation.
If we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
