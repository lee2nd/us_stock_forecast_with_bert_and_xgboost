ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Planet Fitness, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are one of the largest and fastest-growing franchisors and operators of fitness centers in the United States by number of members and locations, with a highly recognized national brand. Our mission is to enhance people’s lives by providing a high-quality fitness experience in a welcoming, non-intimidating environment, which we call the Judgement Free Zone, where anyone-and we mean anyone-can feel they belong. Our bright, clean stores are typically 20,000 square feet, with a large selection of high-quality, purple and yellow Planet Fitness-branded cardio, circuit- and weight-training equipment and friendly staff trainers who offer unlimited free fitness instruction to all our members in small groups through our PE@PF program. We offer this differentiated fitness experience at only $10 per month for our standard membership. This exceptional value proposition is designed to appeal to a broad population, including occasional gym users and the approximately 80% of the U.S. and Canadian populations over age 14 who are not gym members, particularly those who find the traditional fitness club setting intimidating and expensive. We and our franchisees fiercely protect Planet Fitness’ community atmosphere-a place where you do not need to be fit before joining and where progress toward achieving your fitness goals (big or small) is supported and applauded by our staff and fellow members.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 13.5 million members and 2,124 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, Panama, Mexico and Australia. Of our 2,124 stores, 2,021 are franchised and 103 are corporate-owned.
As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments to open more than 1,000 new stores under existing ADAs.
COVID-19 Impact
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic has caused unprecedented economic volatility and uncertainty, which has negatively impacted our recent operating results. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively closed all of our stores system wide in March 2020. Our stores began reopening in early May as local guidelines allowed, and as of December 31, 2020, 1,760 of our stores were open and operating, of which 1,682 were franchisee-owned stores and 78 were corporate-owned stores. Many of these stores remain subject to local capacity restrictions as of December 31, 2020. As COVID-19 continues to impact areas in which our stores operate, certain of our stores have had to re-close or operate subject to capacity restrictions, and additional stores may have to re-close or further reduce capacity, pursuant to local guidelines. As previously announced, members will not be charged monthly membership dues or annual fees while our stores are closed and will be credited for any monthly membership dues paid for periods when our stores were closed. We have experienced and continue to expect to experience decreased new store development and remodels, as well as decreased replacement equipment sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have provided our franchisees 12-month and 18-month extensions for all new store development and re-equipment investment obligations, respectively.
We continue to reopen stores as local authorities issue guidelines authorizing the reopening of fitness centers and we determine it is safe to do so. As stores reopened we have recognized franchise revenue and corporate-owned store revenue associated with any March membership dues collected prior to store closures. We continue to defer revenue for stores that have not yet reopened or which had to re-close. We may have to defer further revenue in the future for stores that are required to re-close.
The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its impact on our business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our operating results in future periods. As a result of COVID-19 we have experienced to date, and may continue to experience, a decrease in our net membership base. We previously withdrew our 2020 full-year guidance and are not providing 2021 guidance at this time due to continued uncertainty around the duration and impact of COVID-19.
We have taken the following actions to efficiently manage the business, as well as increase liquidity and financial flexibility in order to mitigate the current and anticipated future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business:
•Board of Director and Executive Compensation: In March 2020, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial and Chief Digital and Information Officers significantly reduced their base salaries, and the base salaries of other members of senior management were reduced in graduated amounts. These salaries were reinstated beginning in September. The Board of Directors suspended payment of the annual retainer to non-employee directors during the second and third quarters of 2020, and resumed payment in the fourth quarter.
•Corporate-owned stores: We temporarily furloughed all employees except the store manager at each corporate-owned store location for a portion of the time period in which the stores were closed. These employees were able to continue
receiving benefits from the Company during store closures. As of December 31, 2020, 78 of our 103 corporate-owned stores have reopened.
•Corporate Office: Our corporate headquarters closed in March 2020 and reopened in June 2020, allowing employees to continue working remotely if they chose to do so. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we completed a reduction in force of approximately 15% of our corporate headquarters employees.
•Credit Facility: We fully drew down our $75.0 million Variable Funding Notes in March to provide additional liquidity and flexibility.
•Share Repurchase: We suspended share repurchases in March 2020 to preserve liquidity and flexibility.
Although we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to negatively impact the Company’s operations and cash flows, based on management’s current expectations and currently available information, the Company believes current cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures and interest and principal payments for at least the next twelve months.
Composition of Revenues, Expenses and Cash Flows
Revenues
We generate revenue from three primary sources:
•Franchise segment revenue: Franchise segment revenue relates to services we provide to support our franchisees and includes royalty revenue, NAF revenue, franchise fees, placement revenue, other fees and commission income associated with our franchisee-owned stores. Franchise segment revenue does not include the sale of tangible products by us to our franchisees. Our franchise segment revenue comprised 51%, 40% and 39% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•Corporate-owned store segment revenue: Includes monthly membership dues, enrollment fees, annual fees and prepaid fees paid by our members as well as retail sales. This source of revenue comprised 29%, 23%, and 24% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, over 90% of our members paid their monthly dues by EFT, while the remainder prepaid annually in advance.
•Equipment segment revenue: Includes equipment revenue for new U.S. franchisee-owned stores as well as replacement equipment for U.S. existing franchisee-owned stores. Franchisee-owned stores are generally required to replace their equipment every five to seven years. This source of revenue comprised 20%, 37% and 37% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
See Item 7: Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for further discussion on our revenue streams and revenue recognition policies.
Expenses
We primarily incur the following expenses:
•Cost of revenue: Primarily includes the direct costs associated with equipment sales to new and existing franchisee-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada as well as direct costs related to our point-of-sale system. Cost of revenue also includes the cost of retail sales at our corporate-owned stores, which is immaterial. Our cost of revenue changes primarily based on equipment sales volume.
•Store operations: Includes the direct costs associated with our corporate-owned stores, primarily rent, utilities, payroll, marketing, maintenance and supplies. The components of store operations remain relatively stable for each store and change primarily based on the number of corporate-owned stores. Our statements of operations do not include, and we are not responsible for, any costs associated with operating franchisee-owned stores.
•Selling, general and administrative expenses: Consists of costs associated with administrative and franchisee support functions related to our existing business as well as growth and development activities, including costs to support equipment placement and assembly services. These costs primarily consist of payroll, IT-related, marketing, legal and accounting expenses.
•NAF Expense: Consists of expenses incurred on behalf of the NAF. The use of amounts received by the NAF is restricted to advertising, product development, public relations, merchandising, and administrative expenses and programs to increase sales and further enhance the public reputation of the Planet Fitness brand.
Cash flows
We generate a significant portion of our cash flows from monthly membership dues, royalties, NAF revenue and various fees and commissions related to transactions involving our franchisee-owned stores. We oversee the membership billing process, as well as the collection of our royalties, NAF revenue and certain other fees, through our third-party hosted point-of-sale systems. We collect monthly dues from our corporate-owned store members on or around the 17th of each month, while annual fees are collected on or around the 1st day of the second month following the month in which the membership agreement was signed, provided our stores are open. Through our point-of-sale system, we oversee the processing of membership billings for franchisee-owned stores. Our royalties and certain other fees are deducted on or around the 17th of each month from these membership billings by the processor prior to the net billings being remitted to the franchisees. Our franchisees are responsible for maintaining the membership billing records and collection of member dues for their respective stores through the point-of-sale system. Our royalties are based on monthly and annual membership billings for the franchisee-owned stores without regard to the collections of those billings by our franchisees. The amount and timing of the collection of royalties and membership dues and fees at corporate-owned stores is, therefore, generally fairly predictable.
Our corporate-owned stores also historically generate strong operating margins and cash flows, as a significant portion of our costs are fixed or semi-fixed such as rent and labor.
Equipment sales to new and existing franchisee-owned stores also generate significant cash flows. Franchisees either pay in advance or provide evidence of a committed financing arrangement for such equipment.
Each of these cash flows have been negatively impacted, we believe temporarily, by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Recent Transactions
On March 20, 2020, we drew down on the full $75.0 million of borrowing capacity under our Variable Funding Notes in order to increase the cash on our balance sheet during temporary store closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Seasonality
Our results are subject to seasonality fluctuations in that member joins are typically higher in January as compared to other months of the year. In addition, our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including the timing of store openings, timing of price increases for enrollment fees and monthly membership dues and general economic conditions.
See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for our total revenues, income from operations and net income for each of the quarters during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Our Segments
We operate and manage our business in three business segments: Franchise, Corporate-owned stores and Equipment. Our Franchise segment includes operations related to our franchising business in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Panama, Mexico and Australia. Our Corporate-owned stores segment includes operations with respect to all corporate-owned stores throughout the United States and Canada. The Equipment segment includes the sale of equipment to franchisee-owned stores in the U.S. We evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources to them based on revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to as Segment EBITDA. Revenue and Segment EBITDA for all operating segments include only transactions with unaffiliated customers and do not include intersegment transactions. The tables below summarize the financial information for our segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. “Corporate and other,” as it relates to Segment EBITDA, primarily includes corporate overhead costs, such as payroll and related benefit costs and professional services that are not directly attributable to any individual segment.
(1)Total Segment EBITDA is equal to EBITDA, which is a metric that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Refer to “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
A reconciliation of income from operations to Segment EBITDA is set forth below:
(1)Total Segment EBITDA is equal to EBITDA, which is a metric that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Refer to “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Business
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing include total monthly dues and annual fees from members (which we refer to as system-wide sales), the number of new store openings, same store sales for both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned stores, average royalty fee percentages for franchisee-owned stores, monthly PF Black Card membership penetration percentage, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA, four-wall EBITDA, royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted net income per share, diluted. See “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for our definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, four-wall EBITDA, royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted net income per share, diluted and why we present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, four-wall EBITDA, royalty-adjusted four-wall EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, and for a reconciliation of our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and a reconciliation of adjusted net income per share, diluted to net income per share, diluted, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Total monthly dues and annual fees from members (system-wide sales)
We review the total amount of dues we collect from our members on a monthly basis, which allows us to assess changes in the performance of our corporate-owned and franchisee-owned stores from period to period, any competitive pressures, local or regional membership traffic patterns and general market conditions that might impact our store performance. System-wide sales is an operating measure that includes sales by franchisees that are not revenue realized by the Company in accordance with GAAP, as well as sales by the Company’s corporate-owned stores. While the Company does not record sales by franchisees as revenue, and such sales are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company believes that this operating measure aids in understanding how the Company derives its royalty revenue and is important in evaluating its performance. Provided our stores are open, we collect monthly dues on or around the 17th of every month and collect annual fees once per year from each member based upon when the member signed his or her membership agreement. System-wide sales were $2.4 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.8 billion, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Number of new store openings
The number of new store openings reflects stores opened during a particular reporting period for both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned stores. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy and we expect the majority of our future new stores will be franchisee-owned. Before we obtain the certificate of occupancy or report any revenue for new corporate-owned stores, we incur pre-opening costs, such as rent expense, labor expense and other operating expenses. Some of our stores open with an initial start-up period of higher than normal marketing and operating expenses, particularly as a percentage of monthly revenue. New stores may not be profitable and their revenue may not follow historical patterns. The following table shows the growth in our corporate-owned and franchisee-owned store base for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
(1)The term “debranded” refers to a franchisee-owned store whose right to use the Planet Fitness brand and marks has been terminated in accordance with the franchise agreement. We retain the right to prevent debranded stores from continuing to operate as fitness centers.
The term “consolidated” refers to the combination of a franchisee’s store with another store located in close proximity with our prior approval. This often coincides with an enlargement, re-equipment and/or refurbishment of the remaining store.
(2)The “stores operated” includes stores that have closed temporarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. All stores were closed in March 2020 in response to COVID-19, and as of December 31, 2020, 1,760 were re-opened and operating, of which 1,682 were franchisee-owned stores and 78 were corporate-owned stores.
Same store sales
Same store sales refers to year-over-year sales comparisons for the same store sales base of both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned stores. We define the same store sales base to include those stores that have been open and for which monthly membership dues have been billed for longer than 12 months. We measure same store sales based solely upon monthly dues billed to members of our corporate-owned and franchisee-owned stores.
Several factors affect our same store sales in any given period, including the following:
•the number of stores that have been in operation for more than 12 months;
•the percentage mix and pricing of PF Black Card and standard memberships in any period;
•growth in total net memberships per store;
•consumer recognition of our brand and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences;
•overall economic trends, particularly those related to consumer spending;
•our and our franchisees’ ability to operate stores effectively and efficiently to meet consumer expectations;
•marketing and promotional efforts;
•local competition;
•trade area dynamics; and
•opening of new stores in the vicinity of existing locations.
Consistent with common industry practice, we present same store sales as compared to the same period in the prior year for all stores that have been open and for which monthly membership dues have been billed for longer than 12 months, beginning with the thirteenth month and thereafter, as applicable. Same store sales of our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning that we translate the current year’s same store sales of our international stores at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. Since opening new stores will be a significant component of our revenue growth, same store sales is only one measure of how we evaluate our performance.
Stores acquired from or sold to franchisees are removed from the franchisee-owned or corporate-owned same store sales base, as applicable, upon the ownership change and for the twelve months following the date of the ownership change. These stores are included in the corporate-owned or franchisee-owned same store sales base, as applicable, following the twelfth month after the acquisition or sale. These stores remain in the system-wide same store sales base in all periods.
We report same store sales for a given period as long as more than 50% of the stores in our same store sales base were open for every month in the period. All of our stores were closed for a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020 due to COVID-19. Because none of our stores in the same store sales base billed monthly membership dues in all of the months included in the year ended December 31, 2020, we are not providing same store sales comparisons (“NC”) for that period.
The following table shows our same store sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Net member growth per store
Net member growth per store refers to the net change in total members in relation to total stores over time. We capture all membership changes daily through our point-of-sale system. We monitor a combination of membership growth, average members per store, average monthly EFT and transfers from or to an individual store location. We seek to make it simple for members to join, whether online, through our mobile application or in-store, and, while some memberships require a cancellation fee, we offer, and require our franchisees to offer, a non-committal membership option. This approach to memberships is part of our commitment to appeal to new and occasional gym users. As a result, we do not rely upon membership attrition as an operating metric in assessing our performance. We primarily attribute our membership growth to the continued net member growth in existing stores as well as the growth of our system-wide store base.
Average royalty fee percentages for the franchisee-owned stores
The average royalty fee percentage represents royalties collected by us from our franchisees as a percentage of the monthly membership dues and annual fees that are billed by the franchisees to their member base. We have varying royalty fee structures with our franchisee base, ranging from a tiered monthly fee to a royalty of 7.0% of total monthly EFT and annual membership fees across our franchisee base. Our royalty fee in the U.S. and Canada has increased over time to a current rate of 7.0% and 6.59%, respectively, for new franchisees.
PF Black Card penetration percentage
Our PF Black Card penetration percentage represents the number of our members that have opted to enroll in our PF Black Card membership program as a percentage of our total active membership base. PF Black Card members pay higher monthly membership dues than our standard membership and receive additional benefits for these additional fees. These benefits include access to all of our stores system-wide, guest privileges and access to exclusive areas in our stores that provide amenities such as water massage beds, massage chairs, tanning equipment and more. We view PF Black Card penetration percentage as a critical metric in assessing the performance and growth of our business.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We refer to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, four-wall EBITDA and royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA as we use these measures to evaluate our operating performance and we believe these measures are useful to investors in evaluating our performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, four-wall EBITDA and royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA as presented in this Form 10-K are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, four-wall EBITDA and royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP metrics such as net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Also, in the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, four-wall EBITDA and royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We have also disclosed Segment EBITDA as an important financial metric utilized by the Company to evaluate performance and allocate resources to segments in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. As part of such disclosure in “Our Segments” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company has provided a reconciliation from income from operations to Total Segment EBITDA, which is equal to the Non-GAAP financial metric EBITDA.
We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, which eliminates the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provides useful information to investors to assess the performance of our segments as well as the business as a whole. Our Board of Directors also uses EBITDA as a key metric to assess the performance of management. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of the Company’s core operations. These items include certain purchase accounting adjustments, transaction fees, stock offering-related costs, severance expense, pre-opening costs and certain other charges and gains. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance in addition to EBITDA because it eliminates the impact of other items that we believe reduce the comparability of our underlying core business performance from period to period and is therefore useful to our investors in comparing the core performance of our business from period to period. Four-wall EBITDA is an assessment of our average corporate-owned store-level profitability for stores included in the same-store-sales base, which includes local and national advertising expense and adjusts for certain administrative and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of individual store-level performance. Royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA then applies the current royalty rate. Accordingly, we believe that Royalty adjusted four-wall EBITDA is comparable to a franchise store under our current franchise agreement and is useful to investors to assess the operating performance of an average store in our system. Management also uses such metrics in assessing store-level operating performance over time.
A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
(1)Includes $4.6 million of loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2018.
(2)Represents the impact of revenue-related purchase accounting adjustments associated with the 2012 Acquisition. At the time of the 2012 Acquisition, the Company maintained a deferred revenue account, which consisted of deferred area development agreement fees, deferred franchise fees, and deferred enrollment fees that the Company billed and collected up front but recognizes for GAAP purposes at a later date. In connection with the 2012 Acquisition, it was determined that the carrying amount of deferred revenue was greater than the fair value assessed in accordance with ASC 805-Business Combinations, which resulted in a write-down of the carrying value of the deferred revenue balance upon application of acquisition push-down accounting under ASC 805. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, these amounts represent the additional revenue that would have been recognized in those years if the write-down to deferred revenue had not occurred in connection with the application of acquisition pushdown accounting.
(3)Represents the impact of rent related purchase accounting adjustments. In accordance with guidance in ASC 805 - Business Combinations, in connection with the 2012 Acquisition, the Company’s deferred rent liability was required to be written off as of the acquisition date and rent is being recorded on a straight-line basis from the acquisition date through the end of the lease term. This resulted in higher overall rent expense each period than would have otherwise been recorded had the deferred rent liability not been written off as a result of the acquisition push down accounting applied in accordance with ASC 805. Adjustments of $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflect the difference between the higher rent expense recorded in accordance with GAAP since the acquisition and the rent expense that would have been recorded had the 2012 Acquisition not occurred. Adjustments of $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are due to the amortization of favorable and unfavorable lease intangible assets. All of the rent related purchase accounting adjustments are adjustments to rent expense which is included in store operations on our consolidated statements of operations.
(4)Represents the impact of a non-cash loss recorded in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations related to our acquisitions of franchisee-owned stores. The loss recorded under GAAP represents the difference between the fair value of the reacquired franchise rights and the contractual terms of the reacquired franchise rights and is included in other (gain) loss on our consolidated statements of operations.
(5)Represents transaction fees and expenses that could not be capitalized related to the issuance of our 2018 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2018.
(6)Represents severance expense recorded in connection with a reduction in force in 2020 and an equity award modification in 2018.
(7)Represents costs associated with new corporate-owned stores incurred prior to the store opening, including payroll-related costs, rent and occupancy expenses, marketing and other store operating supply expenses.
(8)Represents costs associated with legal matters in which the Company is a defendant. The 2020 amount includes expense of $3.8 million related to the settlement of legal claims, and a $2.0 million reserve against an indemnification receivable related to a legal matter.
(9)Represents a receivable recorded in connection with a contractual obligation of the Company’s co-founders to indemnify the Company with respect to pre-IPO tax liabilities pursuant to the 2012 Acquisition.
(10)Represents gains and losses related to the adjustment of our tax benefit arrangements primarily due to changes in our effective tax rate.
(11)Represents certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. In 2020, this amount includes $1.4 million gain related to an employee retention payroll tax credit received in connection with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). In 2018, this amount includes expense of $0.6 million related to the write off of certain assets that were being tested for potential use across the system.
Adjusted net income assumes all net income is attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc., which assumes the full exchange of all outstanding Holdings Units for shares of Class A common stock of Planet Fitness, Inc., adjusted for certain non-recurring items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations. Adjusted net income per share, diluted, is calculated by dividing Adjusted net income by the total weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding assuming the full exchange of all outstanding Holdings Units and corresponding Class B common stock as of the beginning of each period presented. Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income and earnings per share, as determined by GAAP. We believe Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period. A reconciliation of Adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of Adjusted net income per share, diluted, are set forth below.
(1)Represents the impact of revenue-related purchase accounting adjustments associated with the 2012 Acquisition. At the time of the 2012 Acquisition, the Company maintained a deferred revenue account, which consisted of deferred area development agreement fees, deferred franchise fees, and deferred enrollment fees that the Company billed and collected up front but recognizes for GAAP purposes at a later date.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, these amounts represent the additional revenue that would have been recognized in those years if
the write-down to deferred revenue had not occurred in connection with the application of acquisition pushdown accounting.

Adjustments of $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are due to the amortization of favorable and unfavorable lease intangible assets. All of the rent related purchase accounting adjustments are adjustments to rent expense which is included in store operations on our consolidated statements of operations.
(3)Represents the impact of a non-cash loss recorded in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations related to our acquisition of franchisee-owned stores. The loss recorded under GAAP represents the difference between the fair value of the reacquired franchise rights and the contractual terms of the reacquired franchise rights and is included in other (gain) loss on our consolidated statements of operations.
(4)Represents transaction fees and expenses that could not be capitalized related to the issuance of our 2018 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2018.
(5)Represents a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan B which the Company repaid in August 2018.
(6)Represents severance expense recorded in connection with a reduction in force in 2020 and an equity award modification in 2018.
(7)Represents costs associated with new corporate-owned stores incurred prior to the store opening, including payroll-related costs, rent and occupancy expenses, marketing and other store operating supply expenses.

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Revenue
Total revenues were $406.6 million in 2020, compared to $688.8 million in 2019, a decrease of $282.2 million, or 41.0%.
Franchise segment revenue was $206.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $277.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $71.4 million, or 25.7%.
Franchise revenue was $162.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $223.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $61.0 million or 27.3%. Included in franchise revenue is royalty revenue of $142.5 million, franchise and other fees of $12.7 million, and placement revenue of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to royalty revenue of $188.0 million, franchise and other fees of $17.1 million, and placement revenue of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreases in franchise revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily due to COVID-19 related store closures beginning in March 2020, as well as reduced membership levels.
Commission income, which is included in our franchise segment, was $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.6 million or 83.8%. The decrease was primarily attributable to fewer franchisees on our commission structure compared to the prior year period and store closures associated with COVID-19.
National advertising fund revenue was $43.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in national advertising fund revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of the temporary closures beginning in March 2020 related to COVID-19 as well as reduced membership levels, partially offset by a higher national advertising fund rate of 3.25% beginning in September 2020 through the remainder of the year, as approved by a vote of the franchisees to help offset lost national advertising fund revenues during the closure period.
Revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment was $117.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $159.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $42.6 million, or 26.6%. The decrease was primarily a result of temporary store closures related to COVID-19 beginning in March 2020, as well as reduced membership levels, partially offset by revenue as a result of the acquisition of 16 franchisee-owned stores and the opening of 11 new corporate-owned stores since January 1, 2019.
Equipment segment revenue was $83.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $251.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $168.2 million, or 66.9%. The decrease was driven by lower equipment sales to new and existing franchisee-owned stores in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of COVID-19 related closures beginning in March 2020, the 12-month and 18-month extensions we gave to franchisees for all new store development and re-equipment investment obligations, respectively, and the 15% discount offered to franchisees on equipment purchased in 2020.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher expenses as a result of the acquisition of 16 franchisee-owned stores and the opening of 11 new corporate-owned stores since January 1, 2019, partially offset by lower operating and marketing expenses as a result of COVID-19 related closures beginning in March 2020.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $68.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $78.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $10.2 million, or 13.0%. The decrease was primarily due to lower variable compensation expense, decreased travel and lower equipment placement expenses related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
National advertising fund expense
National advertising fund expense was $61.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses.

Other loss
Other loss was $4.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The $4.4 million loss in the year ended December 31, 2020 includes expense of $3.8 million related to the settlement of legal claims, and $2.0 million represents a reserve against an indemnification receivable related to a legal matter, partially offset by a $1.4 million gain related to an employee retention payroll tax credit received in connection with the CARES Act. The loss of $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a loss on reacquired franchise rights associated with the acquisition of 12 franchisee-owned stores on December 16, 2019.
Interest income
Interest income was $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $7.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of lower interest rates in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest expense

Provision for income taxes
Income tax expense was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $37.1 million. The $37.1 million decrease is primarily attributable to our decreased income before taxes partially offset by changes from the remeasurement of our deferred taxes and by our increased pro-rata share of income from Pla-Fit Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the exchanges by Continuing LLC Owners of Holdings Units for shares of Class A common stock.
Segment results
Franchise
Franchise segment EBITDA was $115.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $192.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $77.3 million, or 40.2%. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to COVID-19 related store closures beginning in March 2020, reduced membership levels, and higher NAF expense, partially offset by lower franchise-related payroll and operational expenses.

The $40.9 million increase in royalty revenue was primarily driven by $14.6 million attributable to a same store sales increase of 9.0% in franchisee-owned stores, and $12.7 million was attributable to royalties from new stores in 2019, as well as those that opened in 2018 that were not included in the same store sales base. Additionally, $9.5 million of the increase was due to higher royalty rates on monthly dues and $4.0 million was due to higher royalty rates on annual fees. The $6.3 million increase in placement revenue was due to higher equipment placements in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
Commission income, which is included in our franchise segment, was $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.3 million or 35.3%.

National advertising fund revenue was $50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $42.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, and is due to a same store sales increase of 9.0% in franchisee-owned stores and from new stores opened in 2019, as well as those that opened in 2018 that were not included in the same store sales base. This revenue is offset by national advertising fund expenses below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had $439.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.
We require cash principally to fund day-to-day operations, to finance capital investments, to service our outstanding debt and tax benefit arrangements and to address our working capital needs. Based on our current level of operations, we believe that with our available cash balance, the cash generated from our operations, and amounts we have drawn under our Variable Funding Notes will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements and obligations under our tax benefit arrangements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. We believe that we will be able to meet these obligations even if we continue to experience a reduction in sales and profits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors.” There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, including our Securitized Senior Notes, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including potential future impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table presents summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Operating activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $31.1 million compared to $204.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $173.2 million. Of the decrease, $168.7 million was due to lower net income after adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, and $4.5 million was primarily due to higher cash used for working capital in income tax, deferred revenue, and inventory, partially offset by higher cash generated due to a decrease in accounts receivable in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Investing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $52.3 million compared to $110.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease in cash used of $58.4 million. Of the decrease, $52.6 million was due to the acquisition of 16 franchisee-owned stores in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $5.3 million was due to lower capital expenditures.
Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Financing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $57.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $64.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $6.5 million. In the year ended December 31, 2020 we had net proceeds from borrowings under our variable funding notes and repayments of long-term debt for a combined impact of $57.5 million. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we had net proceeds from the issuance and repayments of long-term debt of $527.4 million, $458.2 million of cash used to repurchase and retire 6.1 million shares of our Class A common stock, and distributions to members of Pla-Fit Holdings of $7.4 million.
The following table presents summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Operating activities
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $204.3 million compared to $184.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $19.9 million. Of the increase, $36.7 million was due to higher net income after adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $16.7 million due to higher cash used for working capital in accounts payable, other assets and other current assets, and equipment deposits, partially offset by higher cash generated due to a decrease in inventory and lower cash payments for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
Investing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $110.7 million compared to $86.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase in cash used of $24.3 million. This increase in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures for both new and existing corporate-owned stores and information systems as shown in the table below, and $6.8 million more cash used for the acquisition of stores from franchisees.
Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Financing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $64.3 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $109.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $45.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2019 we had net proceeds from the issuance and repayments of long-term debt of $527.4 million, $458.2 million of cash used to repurchase and retire 6.1 million shares of our Class A common stock, and distributions to members of Pla-Fit Holdings of $7.4 million. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net proceeds from the issuance and repayments of long-term debt of $460.4 million, $342.4 million of cash used to repurchase and retire 5.4 million shares of our Class A common stock and distributions to members of Pla-Fit Holdings of $8.3 million.
Securitized Financing Facility
On August 1, 2018, Planet Fitness Master Issuer LLC (the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Pla-Fit Holdings, LLC, entered into a base indenture and a related supplemental indenture (collectively, the “2018 Indenture”) under which the Master Issuer may issue multiple series of notes. On the same date, the Master Issuer issued Series 2018-1 4.262% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “2018 Class A-2-I Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $575 million and Series 2018-1 4.666% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “2018 Class A-2-II Notes” and, together with the 2018 Class A-2-I Notes, the “2018 Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $625 million. In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, the Master Issuer also entered into a revolving financing facility that allows for the incurrence of up to $75 million in revolving loans and/or letters of credit under the Master Issuer’s Series 2018-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes, Class A-1 (the “Variable Funding Notes”). The Company fully drew down on the Variable Funding Notes on March 20, 2020. Outstanding amounts under the Variable Funding Notes bear interest at a variable rate, which is 2.28% as of December 31, 2020. On December 3, 2019, the Master Issuer issued Series 2019-1 3.858% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the “2019 Notes” and, together with the 2018 Notes, the “Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $550 million. The 2019 Notes were issued under the 2018 Indenture and a related supplemental indenture dated December 3, 2019 (together, the “Indenture”). Together the Notes and Variable Funding Notes will be referred to as the “Securitized Senior Notes”.
The Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which most of the Company’s domestic revenue-generating assets, consisting principally of franchise-related agreements, certain corporate-owned store assets, equipment supply agreements and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, were assigned to the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors of the Securitized Senior Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure the Securitized Senior Notes.
Interest and principal payments on the Notes are payable on a quarterly basis. The requirement to make such quarterly principal payments on the Notes is subject to certain financial conditions set forth in the Indenture. The legal final maturity date of the 2018 Notes is in September 2048, but it is anticipated that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the 2018 Class A-2-I Notes will be repaid in September 2022 and the 2018 Class A-2-II Notes will be repaid in September 2025. The legal final maturity date of the 2019 Notes is in December 2049, but it is anticipated that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the 2019 Notes will be repaid in December 2029 (together, the “Anticipated Repayment Dates”). If the Master Issuer has not repaid or refinanced the Notes prior to the respective Anticipated Repayment Dates, additional interest will accrue pursuant to the Indenture.
As noted above, the Company borrowed the full $75 million in Variable Funding Notes on March 20, 2020. The Variable Funding Notes accrue interest at a variable interest rate based on (i) the prime rate, (ii) overnight federal funds rates, (iii) the London interbank offered rate for U.S. Dollars, or (iv) with respect to advances made by conduit investors, the weighted average cost of, or related to, the issuance of commercial paper allocated to fund or maintain such advances, in each case plus
any applicable margin and as specified in the Variable Funding Notes. There is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Variable Funding Notes of 0.5% based on utilization. It is anticipated that the principal and interest on the Variable Funding Notes will be repaid in full on or prior to September 2023, subject to two additional one-year extension options. Following the anticipated repayment date (and any extensions thereof) additional interest will accrue on the Variable Funding Notes equal to 5.0% per year.
In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $27.1 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The debt issuance costs are being amortized to “Interest expense” through the Anticipated Repayment Dates of the Notes utilizing the effective interest rate method.
The Securitized Senior Notes are subject to covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Securitized Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Securitized Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective, (iv) a cap on non-securitized indebtedness of $50 million (provided that the Company may incur non-securitized indebtedness in excess of such amount, subject to the leverage ratio cap described below, under certain conditions, including if the relevant lenders execute a non-disturbance agreement that acknowledges the bankruptcy-remote status of the Master Issuer and its subsidiaries and of their respective assets), (v) a leverage ratio cap incurrence test on the Company of 7.0x (calculated without regard for any indebtedness subject to the $50 million cap) and (vi) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.
Pursuant to a parent company support agreement, the Company has agreed to cause its subsidiary to perform each of its obligations (including any indemnity obligations) and duties under the Management Agreement and under the contribution agreements entered into in connection with the securitized financing facility, in each case as and when due. To the extent that such subsidiary has not performed any such obligation or duty within the prescribed time frame after such obligation or duty was required to be performed, the Company has agreed to either (i) perform such obligation or duty or (ii) cause such obligations or duties to be performed on the Company’s behalf.
The Securitized Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance the Notes on the applicable scheduled Anticipated Repayment Dates. The Securitized Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Securitized Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.
In accordance with the Indenture, certain cash accounts have been established with the Indenture trustee (the “Trustee”) for the benefit of the trustee and the noteholders, and are restricted in their use. The Company holds restricted cash which primarily represents cash collections held by the Trustee, interest, principal, and commitment fee reserves held by the Trustee related to the Securitized Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had restricted cash held by the Trustee of $60.3 million, which includes pre-funding of the full principal and interest payments through the March 5, 2021 payment date, and a substantial portion of the June 5, 2021 payment date. Restricted cash has been combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes were used to repay all amounts outstanding on the Term Loan B under the Company’s prior credit facility. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, primarily consisting of the write-off of deferred costs related to the prior credit facility.
Share Repurchase Program
2019 share repurchase program
On November 5, 2019, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $500 million (the “2019 Share Repurchase Program”).
On December 4, 2019, the Company entered into a $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “2019 ASR Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMC”). Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 ASR Agreement, on December 5, 2019, the Company paid JPMC $300 million upfront in cash and received approximately 3.3 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, which were retired. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on March 2, 2020. At final settlement, JPMC delivered approximately 667,000 additional shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, based on a weighted average cost per share of $75.82 over the term of the 2019 ASR Agreement, which were retired.
On March 18, 2020, the Company announced the suspension of its 2019 share repurchase program. If the 2019 share repurchase program is reinstated, the timing of purchases and amount of stock repurchased will be subject to the Company’s discretion and will depend on market and business conditions, the Company’s general working capital needs, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Our ability to repurchase shares at any particular time is also subject to the terms of the Indenture governing the Securitized Senior Notes. Purchases may be effected through one or more open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. The Company may reinstate or terminate the program at any time.
2018 share repurchase program
On August 3, 2018, our board of directors approved an increase to the total amount of the share repurchase program to $500 million (the “2018 Share Repurchase Program”).
On November 13, 2018, we entered into a $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “2018 ASR Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A. (the “Citibank”). We acquired shares under the 2018 ASR Agreement as part of our 2018 $500 million share repurchase authorization (the “2018 Share Repurchase Authorization”). On November 14, 2018, we paid Citibank $300 million in cash and received approximately 4.6 million shares of our Class A common stock, which were retired. Final settlement of the 2018 ASR Agreement occurred on April 30, 2019. At final settlement, Citibank delivered approximately 524,000 additional shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, based on a weighted average cost per share of $58.46 over the term of the 2018 ASR Agreement, which were retired.
Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased at market value and retired 2,272,001 and 824,312 shares of Class A common stock for a total cost of $157.9 million and $42.1 million, respectively, completing the 2018 Share Repurchase Program.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table presents contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020.
(1)Long-term debt payments include scheduled principal payments only.
(2)Timing of payments under tax benefit arrangements is estimated.
(3)As of December 31, 2020, we had advertising purchase commitments of approximately $32.6 million, including commitments for the NAF.
(4)Purchase obligations consists of $10.2 million for open purchase orders primarily related to equipment to be sold to franchisees. For the majority of our equipment purchase obligations, our policy is to require the franchisee to provide us with either a deposit or proof of a committed financing arrangement.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of guarantees of lease agreements for certain franchisees. Our maximum total commitment under these agreements is approximately $7.8 million and would only require payment upon default by the primary obligor. The estimated fair value of these guarantees at December 31, 2020 was not material, and no accrual has been recorded for our potential obligation under these arrangements. In 2019, in connection with a real estate partnership, the Company began guaranteeing certain leases of its franchisees up to a maximum period of ten years, with earlier expiration dates if certain conditions are met. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information regarding these operating leases and guarantees.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our consolidated financial statements including those that involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. A thorough understanding of these critical accounting policies is essential when reviewing our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below are those that are most important to the portrayal of our results of operations or involve the most difficult management decisions related to the use of significant estimates and assumptions as described above.
Revenue
Franchise revenue
Franchise revenues consist primarily of royalties, NAF contributions, the recognition of deferred revenue from initial and renewal franchise fees, fees from area development agreements (“ADAs”), and transfer fees, as well as equipment placement revenue, other fees and commission income.
The Company’s primary performance obligation under the franchise license is granting certain rights to use the Company’s intellectual property, and all other services the Company provides under the ADA and franchise agreement are highly interrelated, not distinct within the contract, and therefore accounted for as a single performance obligation, which is satisfied by granting certain rights to use our intellectual property over the term of each franchise agreement.
Royalties, including franchisee contributions to national advertising funds, are generally calculated as a percentage of franchise monthly dues and annual fees over the term of the franchise agreement. Under our franchise agreements, advertising contributions paid by franchisees must be spent on advertising, marketing and related activities. Initial and renewal franchise fees are payable by the franchisee upon signing a new or successor franchise agreement, and transfer fees are paid to the Company when one franchisee transfers a franchise agreement to a different franchisee. Our franchise royalties, as well as our NAF contributions, represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to our performance obligation under the franchise agreement and are recognized as franchise sales occur.
Additionally, under ASC 606, initial and renewal franchise fees, as well as transfer fees, are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective franchise agreement. Under the Previous Standards, initial franchise fees were recognized as revenue when the related franchisees signed a lease and completed the Company’s new franchisee training. Renewal franchise fees and transfer fees were recognized as revenue upon execution of a new franchise agreement. Our performance obligation under ADAs generally consists of an obligation to grant geographic exclusive area development rights. These development rights are not distinct from franchise agreements, so upfront fees paid by franchisees for exclusive development rights are deferred and apportioned to each franchise agreement signed by the franchisee. The pro-rata amount apportioned to each franchise agreement is accounted for identically to the initial franchise fee.
The Company is generally responsible for assembly and placement of equipment it sells to U.S. based franchisee-owned stores. Placement revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance of the services at the franchise location.
The Company recognizes commission income from certain of its franchisees’ use of certain preferred vendor arrangements. Commissions are recognized when amounts have been earned and collectability from the vendor is reasonably assured.
Online member join fees are paid to the Company by franchisees for processing new membership transactions when a new member signs up for a membership to a franchisee-owned store through the Company’s website. These fees are recognized as revenue as each transaction occurs.
Billing transaction fees are paid to the Company by certain of its franchisees for the processing of franchisee membership dues and annual fees through the Company’s third-party hosted point-of-sale system and are recognized as revenue as they are earned.
Equipment revenue
The Company sells and delivers equipment purchased from third-party equipment manufacturers to U.S. and Canada based franchisee-owned stores. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of ordered items, generally upon delivery to the customer, which is when the customer obtains physical possession of the goods, legal title is transferred, the customer has all risks and rewards of ownership and an obligation to pay for the goods is created. Franchisees are charged for all freight costs incurred for the delivery of equipment. Freight revenue is recorded within equipment revenue and freight costs are recorded within cost of revenue. In most instances, the Company recognizes equipment revenue on a gross basis as management has determined the Company to be the principal in these transactions. Management determined the Company to be the principal in the transaction because the Company controls the equipment prior to delivery to the final customer as evidenced by its pricing discretion over the goods, inventory transfer of title and risk of loss while the inventory is in transit, and having the primary responsibility to fulfill the customer order and direct the third-party vendor.
Corporate-owned stores revenue
The following revenues are generated from stores owned and operated by the Company.
Monthly membership fee revenue
Membership dues are earned and recognized over the membership term on a straight-line basis.
Enrollment fee revenue
Enrollment fees are charged to new members at the commencement of their membership. The Company recognizes enrollment fees ratably over the estimated duration of the membership life, which is generally two years.
Annual membership fee revenue
Annual membership fees are annual fees charged to members in addition to and in order to maintain low monthly membership dues. The Company recognizes annual membership fees ratably over the 12-month membership period.
Retail sales
The Company sells Planet Fitness branded apparel, food, beverages, and other accessories. The revenue for these items is recognized at the point of sale.
Leases
The below discussions of lease accounting policies are the policies that went into effect beginning on January 1, 2019 with the adoption of ASC 842. For periods prior to January 1, 2019 we applied the policies under ASC 840. See Note 2 in Item 8: Financial Statements for a discussion of the policies in place under ASC 840.
The Company leases space to operate corporate-owned stores, equipment, office, and warehouse space. We currently lease our corporate headquarters and all but one of our corporate-owned stores. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases beginning in 2019 and later, we account for fixed lease and non-lease components together as a single, combined lease component. Variable lease costs, which may include common area maintenance, insurance, and taxes are not included in the lease liability and are expensed in the period incurred.
Our corporate-owned store leases generally have remaining terms of one to ten years, and typically include one or more renewal options, with renewal terms that can generally extend the lease term from three to ten years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. The Company includes options to renew in the expected term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term.
At the inception of each lease, we determine its appropriate classification as an operating or financing lease. The majority of our leases are operating leases. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, we estimate incremental secured borrowing rates corresponding to the maturities of the leases based upon interpolated rates using our Notes.
The Company has certain non-real estate leases that are accounted for as finance leases under ASC 842, which is similar to the accounting for capital leases under the previous standard.
Our leases typically contain rent escalations over the lease term. We recognize expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and
reduce our ROU asset related to the lease. These tenant incentives are amortized as reduction of rent expense over the lease term.
Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
We expend cash for leasehold improvements and to build out and equip our leased premises. We may also expend cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises. Generally, a portion of the leasehold improvements and building costs are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed-upon terms in our leases. If obtained, landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up-front cash, full or partial credits against our future minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us, or a combination thereof. When contractually due to us, we classify tenant improvement allowances within property and equipment and as a reduction of the ROU asset on the consolidated balance sheets and depreciate the tenant improvement allowance on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Business combinations
We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting which results in the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at fair value.
The valuation methodologies used are based on the nature of the asset or liability. The significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value include property and equipment, intangible assets, deferred revenue and favorable and unfavorable leases. For the 2012 Acquisition, intangible assets consisted of trade and brand names, member relationships, franchisee relationships related to both our franchise and equipment segments, non-compete agreements, order backlog and favorable and unfavorable leases. For other acquisitions, which consist of acquisitions of stores from franchisees, intangible assets generally consist of member relationships, re-acquired franchise rights, and favorable and unfavorable leases.
The fair value of trade and brand names is estimated using the relief from royalty method, an income approach to valuation, which includes projecting future system-wide sales and other estimates. Membership relationships and franchisee relationships are valued based on an estimate of future revenues and costs related to the respective contracts over the remaining expected lives. Our valuation includes assumptions related to the projected attrition and renewal rates on those existing franchise and membership arrangements being valued. Re-acquired franchise rights are valued using an excess earnings approach. The valuation of re-acquired franchise rights is determined using an estimation of future royalty income and related expenses associated with existing franchise contracts at the acquisition date. For re-acquired franchise rights with terms that are either favorable or unfavorable (from our perspective) to the terms included in our current franchise agreements, a gain or charge is recorded at the time of the acquisition to the extent of the favorability or unfavorability, respectively. Favorable and unfavorable operating leases are recorded based on differences between contractual rents under the respective lease agreements and prevailing market rents at the lease acquisition date. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, these are recorded as a component of the ROU asset and prior to the adoption of ASC 842 were recorded as intangible assets. Deferred revenue is valued based on our estimated costs to fulfill the obligations assumed, plus a normal profit margin. No deferred revenue amounts are recognized for enrollment fees in our business combinations as there is no remaining obligation.
We consider our trade and brand name intangible assets to have an indefinite useful life, and, therefore, these assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment annually as discussed below. Amortization of re-acquired franchise rights and franchisee relationships is recorded over the respective franchise terms using the straight-line method which we believe approximates the period during which we expect to receive the related benefits. Member relationships are amortized on an accelerated basis based on expected attrition. Favorable and unfavorable operating leases are amortized into rental expense over the lease term of the respective leases using the straight-line method.
Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets
We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Store-level assets are grouped by store and assessed on a store by store basis for the purpose of the impairment assessment. There were no impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Goodwill has been assigned to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. Our reporting units are Franchise, Corporate-owned stores and Equipment, which are the same as our reportable segments. The goodwill impairment test consists of a comparison of each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is an estimate of the amount for which the unit as a whole could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. Fair value of a reporting unit is estimated based on a combination of comparative market multiples and discounted cash flow valuation approaches. We are also permitted
to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value prior to applying the quantitative assessment. If based on our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, then a quantitative assessment is not required. In 2020, the qualitative assessment was utilized to assess goodwill for impairment in each of our reporting units.
We evaluate the remaining useful lives of our trade and brand name intangible assets to determine whether current events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. In addition, all of our indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually. The trade and brand name intangible asset impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recognized as an impairment loss. We are also permitted to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not an indefinite lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value prior to applying the quantitative assessment. If based on our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of the asset is less than its fair value, then a quantitative assessment is not required. The qualitative assessment was utilized to assess our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in 2020.
Currently, we have selected the last day of our year as the date on which to perform our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. We also test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of such indefinite lived intangibles has been impaired. No impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Equity-based compensation
We have equity-based compensation plans under which we receive services from our employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Company, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance share units, and an employee stock purchase plan. The compensation expense is determined based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are satisfied. For awards with graded vesting, the fair value of each tranche is recognized over its respective vesting period.
Income taxes
Planet Fitness, Inc. is the sole managing member of Pla-Fit Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, Pla-Fit Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by Pla-Fit Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including Planet Fitness, Inc., on a pro rata basis. Planet Fitness, Inc. is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to the Company’s allocable share of any taxable income of Pla-Fit Holdings. The Company is also subject to taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying amount of the existing tax assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The principal items giving rise to temporary differences are the use of accelerated depreciation and certain basis differences resulting from acquisitions and the recapitalization transactions. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We recognize the effects of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
Pla-Fit Holdings is liable for certain state and local taxes and is subject to tax withholding in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, Pla-Fit Holdings makes pro rata tax distributions to the holders of Holdings Units in an amount sufficient to fund all or part of their tax obligations with respect to the taxable income of Pla-Fit Holdings that is allocated to them. See “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Recapitalization transactions in connection with our IPO-Pla-Fit Holdings amended and restated limited liability company agreement.”
Tax Benefit Arrangements
Our acquisition of Holdings Units in connection with the IPO and future and certain past exchanges of Holdings Units for shares of our Class A common stock (or cash at the option of the Company) are expected to produce and have produced favorable tax attributes. In connection with the IPO, we entered into two tax receivable agreements. Under the first of those agreements, we are generally required to pay to the TRA Holders 85% of the applicable tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal and state income tax that we are deemed to realize as a result of certain tax attributes of their Holdings Units sold to us (or exchanged in a taxable sale) and that are created as a result of (i) the sales of their Holdings Units for shares of Class A common stock and (ii) tax benefits attributable to payments made under the tax receivable agreement (including imputed interest). Under the second tax receivable agreement, we are generally required to pay to the Direct TSG Investors 85% of the amount of tax savings, if any, that we are deemed to realize as a result of the tax attributes of the Holdings Units held in respect
of the Direct TSG Investors’ interest in the Company, which resulted from the Direct TSG Investors’ purchase of interests in Pla-Fit Holdings in 2012, and certain other tax benefits. Under both agreements, we generally retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the applicable tax savings.
Based on current projections, we anticipate having sufficient taxable income to utilize these tax attributes and receive corresponding tax deductions in future periods. Accordingly, we have recorded a liability of $488.2 million, payable to the Direct TSG Investors and the TRA Holders under the tax benefit obligations, representing approximately 85% of the calculated tax savings based on the original basis adjustments we anticipate being able to utilize in future years. Changes in the projected liability resulting from these tax benefit arrangements may occur based on changes in anticipated future taxable income, changes in applicable tax rates or other changes in tax attributes that may occur and impact the expected future tax benefits to be received by the Company. Changes in the projected liability under these tax benefit arrangements will be recorded as a component of other income (expense) each period. The projection of future taxable income involves significant judgment. Actual taxable income may differ from our estimates, which could significantly impact the liability under the tax benefit arrangements and our consolidated results of operations.
We expect to receive additional increases in our share of the tax basis of Pla-Fit Holdings assets when the TRA Holders exchange Holdings Units (together with the corresponding shares of Class B common stock) for Class A common stock. If we acquire Holdings Units from the TRA Holders, we expect both the original basis adjustments and the anticipated basis adjustments will increase, resulting in additional future tax deductions and therefore reducing the amount of future income tax we would otherwise be required to pay. These potential future increases in tax basis will result in additional deferred tax assets and additional liabilities under the tax benefit arrangements, representing approximately 85% of the projected tax savings for the expected use of these tax attributes. Such amounts will be recorded at the time of these future exchanges based on our projections of taxable income and other factors that may exist at the time of such exchanges.
