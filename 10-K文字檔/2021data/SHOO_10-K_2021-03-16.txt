Executive Summary
In December 2019, COVID-19 emerged and spread worldwide. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a
pandemic in March 2020, resulting in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions, including the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay-at-home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. After closely monitoring and taking into consideration the guidance from federal, state and local governments, in March 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores and our corporate offices in the U.S. and the vast majority of our stores and offices globally. As of August 2020, the vast majority of our stores and corporate offices in the U.S. and globally reopened. These and other factors have had and may continue to have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flow. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took precautionary measures to maintain adequate liquidity and financial flexibility by temporarily suspending share repurchases and the quarterly cash dividend; temporarily suspending salaries of our founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steve Madden, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Edward Rosenfeld, and our Board of Directors (all of which were reinstated on October 1); temporarily reducing salaries by 30% for our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Merchandising Officer (all of which were reinstated on August 1); temporarily reducing salaries by graduated amounts for all other employees earning over $100 per year (all of which were reinstated on August 1); significantly scaling back on non-essential operating expenses, and capital expenditures and inventory purchases.
The impact of COVID-19 resulted in an unprecedented decline in our revenue and earnings during the year ended 2020, including but not limited to, charges from adjustments to the carrying amount of certain trademarks, long-lived asset impairment charges and restructuring and other related charges. We expect the pandemic will continue to have a significant negative impact on our revenue and earnings during 2021.
Total revenue for 2020 decreased by 32.8% to $1,201,814 from $1,787,157 in 2019, with decreases in all segments as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net loss attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. was $18,397 in 2020 compared to net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. of $141,311 in 2019. Our effective tax rate for 2020 increased to 39.0% compared to 21.8% recorded in 2019. Diluted loss per share in 2020 was $0.23 per share on 78,635 diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared to diluted earnings of $1.69 per share on 83,646 diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the prior year.
We did not report same store sales or sales per square foot data in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent closure of our brick-and-mortar stores from the second half of March through at least the end of May and subsequent mandated closures. As of December 31, 2020, we had 218 stores in operation, compared to 227 stores as of December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted from the closure of nine full-price stores, four outlet stores and one e-commerce website partially offset by the opening of three full-price stores and two outlet stores.
Our inventory turnover (calculated on a trailing four quarter average) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 7.1 times and 8.1 times, respectively. Our total company accounts receivable average collection days were 73 days in 2020 compared to 70 days in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had $287,166 in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, no debt and total stockholders’ equity of $790,369. Working capital increased to $462,325 as of December 31, 2020, compared to $437,608 on December 31, 2019. The increase in working capital was primarily due to actions taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on delivering trend-right product, deepening connections with our consumers, enhancing our digital commerce business, and efficiently managing our inventory and expenses.
The following table sets forth information on operations for the periods indicated:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
($ in thousands)
Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2019
Consolidated:
Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 32.8% to $1,201,814 from $1,787,157 for fiscal 2019,with decreases in all segments as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit was $464,541, or 38.7% of total revenue, as compared to $686,017, or 38.4% of total revenue, in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to the shift in sales to our higher-margin e-commerce business. Operating expenses in 2020 were $414,978, or 34.5% of total revenue, as compared $503,270, or 28.2% of total revenue, in 2019. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to a deleverage on a lower sales base, but was also impacted by the impairment of lease right-of-use assets and store fixed assets, early lease termination and modification charges, and restructuring and other related charges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was partially offset by our reduction in workforce, furloughs, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary spending as a result of our initiatives to control expenses, along with the change in valuation of contingent considerations. In addition, for the years 2020 and 2019, impairments of intangibles of $44,273 and $4,050 were recorded, respectively. Also in 2020 and 2019, impairments for lease right-of-use assets and store fixed assets of $36,895 and $1,883 were recorded, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 39.0% compared to 21.8% last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the year-over-year benefit resulting from the exercising and vesting of share-based awards, an increase in tax benefit related to a net operating loss carryback claim set forth by the CARES Act, an increase in the GILTI tax, a decrease in the state taxes incurred, and an increase in 2019 pre-tax losses in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Net loss attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $18,397 compared to net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. of $141,311 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of Wholesale Footwear revenue was primarily due to close-outs of excess inventory resulting from store closures and order cancellations from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher sales mix of our private label business, partially offset by lower markdowns. Operating expenses were $162,357, or 22.7% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, in 2020 compared to $206,055, or 18.5% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, in 2019. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of Wholesale Footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a deleverage on a lower sales base in addition to restructuring and other related charges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our reduction in workforce, furloughs, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary spending as a result of our initiatives to control expenses. For 2020 and 2019, intangible impairment charges of $16,345 and $4,050 were recorded, respectively. Income from operations decreased to $47,854 for 2020 compared to $163,482 for 2019.

The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue was primarily attributable to a deleverage on a lower sales base, but was also impacted by restructuring and other related charges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in expenses was partially offset by our reduction in workforce, furloughs, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary spending as a result of our initiatives to control expenses, along with a change in valuation of a contingent consideration. For 2020, an intangible impairment charge of $27,472
was recorded. Loss from operations for the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment was $17,496 in 2020 compared to income from operations of $22,455 in 2019.
Retail Segment:

During 2020, we added five stores and closed 14 stores. As of December 31, 2020 we had 218 retail stores compared to 227 stores as of December 31, 2019.

The increase in gross profit as a percentage of Retail revenue was primarily due to a shift in sales to the higher-margin e-commerce business and less discounting.

jurisdictions with low tax rates. Net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $141,311 compared to $129,136 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase in net revenue was primarily driven by strong growth in Steve Madden Women's, along with the full year of recognizing revenue for the Anne Klein brand and an increase in our private label business, partially offset by not recognizing sales to Payless ShoeSource in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018.
Gross profit margin in 2019 was 33.6%, while gross profit margin in 2018 was 32.7%. The increase in gross profit margin of 90 basis points was primarily attributable to strong growth in Steve Madden Women's, along with not recognizing sales to the low-margin Payless ShoeSource customer.

Recorded in the Wholesale Footwear segment was a $4,050 impairment charge for the Brian Atwood trademark impacting operating income for 2019. The increase in operating expenses primarily resulted from higher payroll and related expenses, warehouse and distribution expenses and other selling expenses associated with higher sales and the addition of the Anne Klein footwear business.

The increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in our Steve Madden branded handbags, the full year of recognizing sales for the Anne Klein brand, as well as the addition of the BB Dakota apparel business.
Gross profit margin in the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment decreased to 29.3% in 2019 from 30.6% in the prior year period. The 1.3% decrease in gross margin resulted from tariffs imposed on accessories when compared to 2018.

The increase primarily resulted from higher payroll related expenses associated with the increase in sales, as well as the addition of the BB Dakota apparel business. Also, contributing to the increase were higher warehouse and distribution expenses, other selling expenses and marketing expenses all based on higher sales volume. Income from operations for the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment decreased to $22,455 in 2019 compared to $27,092 in 2018.
Retail Segment:
Revenue generated by the Retail segment accounted for $321,182, or 18.0%, and $295,152, or 17.6%, of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which represents a $26,030, or 8.8%, increase. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales of 6.1% driven by the significant growth in our e-commerce business. During 2019, we had net closures of 2 stores. The net closures comprised 17 full-price locations, 2 outlet locations and 1 e-commerce website, partially offset by the addition of 8 full-price stores, 8 outlets and 2 e-commerce websites, which included the additional stores and e-commerce sites from the acquisition of GREATS and BB Dakota brands. As a result, we had 227 retail stores as of December 31, 2019, compared to 229 stores as of December 31, 2018. The 227 stores currently in operation include 146 Steve Madden® full-price stores, 68 Steve Madden® outlet stores, 2 Steven® stores, 2 GREATS® stores, 1 Superga store and 8 e-commerce websites. In addition, we operated 31 concessions in our international markets.

We exclude new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operations. Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the gross profit margin increased to 60.8% from 60.4% in 2018 primarily due to higher margins in our e-commerce business partially offset by a loss of $386 related to the termination of a joint venture in China. In 2019, operating expenses increased to $202,444, or 63.0% of revenue, from $177,655, or 60.2% of revenue, in 2018. Also in 2019, impairments for lease right-of-use assets of $1,883 were recorded.

The decrease in commission fee income is primarily due to the Payless ShoeSource bankruptcy that occurred in 2019. Operating expenses slightly decreased to $15,618 in 2019 from $15,775 in 2018. Loss from operations was $8,177 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4,549 in 2018.

The decrease in licensing fee income is primarily due to a decrease in royalties in connection with Payless ShoeSource bankruptcy. Operating expenses increased to $3,477 in 2019 from $2,933 in 2018. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll related expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, income for the Licensing segment amounted to $8,104 as compared to the prior year income of $9,966.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
($ in thousands)
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took precautionary measures to maintain adequate liquidity and financial flexibility by temporarily suspending share repurchases and the quarterly cash dividend, furloughing a significant portion of our employees, significantly reducing our corporate workforce, temporarily suspending salaries of our founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steve Madden, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Edward Rosenfeld, and our Board of Directors (which were all reinstated on October 1); temporarily reducing salaries by 30% for our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Merchandising Officer (which were all reinstated on August 1); temporarily reducing salaries by graduated amounts for all other employees earning over $100 per year (which were reinstated on August 1); significantly scaling back on non-essential operating expenses, capital expenditures and planned inventory purchases.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $287,166 and $304,622 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we held $158,610, or approximately 56%, of our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our foreign subsidiaries, and at December 31, 2019, we held $137,072, or approximately 45%, in our foreign subsidiaries.
We had a collection agency agreement with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. (“Rosenthal”) until May 6, 2020. The agreement provided us with a credit facility in the amount of $30,000, having a sub-limit of $15,000 on the aggregate face amounts of letters of credit, at an interest rate based, at our election, upon either the prime rate or LIBOR. Effective May 6, 2020, the credit facility was increased to $50,000 as a precautionary measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On July 22, 2020, we entered into a new $150,000, five-year, asset-based revolving credit facility with Citizens Bank, N.A. and various participating lenders, which replaced our credit facility with Rosenthal.
As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $462,325, cash and cash equivalents of $247,864, and short-term investments of $39,302 and no debt.

In addition, as a precautionary measure, we have entered into the $150,000 asset-based revolving credit facility, which provides additional liquidity and flexibility should we need it.
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
($ in thousands)
Cash provided by operations was $44,206 in 2020 compared to cash provided by operations of $233,780 in the prior year. The reduction in cash provided by operations was primarily driven by the reduction of income as result of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable changes in our working capital, including unfavorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses and factor accounts receivable, partially offset by favorable changes in inventories and accounts receivables.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
($ in thousands)
During the year ended December 31, 2020 cash used in investing activities was $4,884, of which we invested $73,792 in marketable securities and received $75,470 from the maturities and sales of securities.

We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist outside of the United States for the manufacture of our products. Purchases are made primarily in United States dollars.
We have employment agreements with our Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden, and certain executive officers, which provide for the payment of compensation aggregating approximately $10,700 in 2021, $8,941 in 2022 and $7,774 in 2023. In addition, some of these employment agreements provide for discretionary bonuses and some provide for incentive compensation based on various performance criteria as well as other benefits, including stock-related compensation.
Transition tax of $14,847 was the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"). For further information, refer to Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Excluded from the contractual obligations table above are long-term taxes payable of $2,295 as of December 31, 2020 primarily related to uncertain tax positions, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond one year due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
DIVIDENDS
In February 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on March 27, 2020, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 17, 2020. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended March 31, 2020 of $12,459.
At the end of March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as a precautionary measure our Board of Directors temporarily suspended the payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common stock.
On February 24, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share is payable on March 26, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2021.
Future quarterly cash dividend payments are also subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and contingent upon future earnings, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that cash dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the future.
INFLATION
We do not believe that inflation and price changes have had a significant effect on our sales or profitability for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and the prior two fiscal years. Historically, we have minimized the impact of product cost increases by increasing prices, changing suppliers and improving operating efficiencies. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset any such inflationary cost increases in the future.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information. Our estimates are made based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management. Assumptions and estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis, and we may employ outside experts to assist in evaluations. Therefore, actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are more significantly affected by judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: allowance for bad debts; customer returns, chargebacks and co-op advertising; inventory valuation; valuation of intangible assets; litigation reserves; and contingent payment liabilities.
Allowances for bad debts. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable, assessments of collectability based on historical trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. In general, the actual bad debt losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we have established. The reserve against our non-factored trade receivables also includes estimated losses that may result from customers’ inability to pay.
Customer returns, chargebacks and co-op advertising. We provide variable consideration to our customers for chargebacks, discounts, co-op advertising, returns and other miscellaneous deductions that relate to the current period. The amount of the consideration for returns, discounts and compliance chargebacks is determined by analyzing aged receivables, current economic conditions, the prevailing retail environment and historical dilution levels for customers. We evaluate anticipated customer markdowns and chargebacks by reviewing several performance indicators for our major customers. These performance indicators (which include inventory levels on the retail floors, sell through rates and gross margin levels) are analyzed by management to estimate the amount of the anticipated customer allowance. Under our co-op advertising programs, we agree to reimburse the retailer for a portion of the costs incurred by the retailer to advertise and promote some of our products. We estimate the costs of co-op advertising programs based on the terms of the agreements with its retailer customers. Failure to correctly estimate the amount of the reserve could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
Inventory valuation. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. We review inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow-moving inventory. The review is based on an analysis of inventory on hand, prior sales, and expected net realizable value through future sales. The analysis includes a review of inventory quantities on hand at period-end in relation to year-to-date sales and projections for sales in the foreseeable future as well as subsequent sales. We consider quantities on hand in excess of estimated future sales to be at risk for market impairment. The net realizable value, or market value, is determined based on the estimate of sales prices of such inventory through off-price or discount store channels. The likelihood of any material inventory write-down is dependent primarily on the expectation of future consumer demand for our products. A misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer demand for our products, the economy, or other failure to estimate correctly, in addition to abnormal weather patterns, could result in inventory valuation changes, compared to the valuation determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date.
Valuation of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually. This accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite
lives be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are assessed for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events or circumstances in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible or a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors considered include historical financial performance, macroeconomic and industry conditions and legal and regulatory environment. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, and if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment is recognized equal to the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter or if impairment indicators warrant a test.
Impairment of long-lived assets. We perform an impairment review of our long-lived assets, once events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When such a determination has been made, management compares the carrying value of the asset groups with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, the fair value of the asset group is determined and compared to its carrying value. The excess of the carrying value over the fair value, if any, is recognized as a loss during that period. The impairment is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value of the long-lived assets.
Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for litigation claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable events of a particular litigation. As additional information becomes available, management will assess the potential liability related to the pending litigation and revise its estimates. Such revisions in management’s estimates of a contingent liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position.
Contingent payment liabilities. We have completed acquisitions that require us to make contingent payments to the sellers based on the future financial performance of the acquired businesses over a period from one to three years. The fair value of the contingent payments is estimated using the present value of management's projections of the financial results of the acquired business. Failure to correctly project the financial results of the acquired businesses could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
