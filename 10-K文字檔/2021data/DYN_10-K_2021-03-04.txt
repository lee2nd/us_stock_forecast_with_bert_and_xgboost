Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are building a leading muscle disease company focused on advancing innovative life-transforming therapeutics for patients with genetically driven diseases. We are utilizing our proprietary FORCE platform to overcome the current limitations of muscle tissue delivery and advance modern oligonucleotide therapeutics for muscle diseases. Our proprietary FORCE platform therapeutics consist of an oligonucleotide payload that we rationally design to target the genetic basis of the disease we are seeking to treat, a clinically validated linker and an antigen-binding fragment, or Fab, that we attach to the payload using the linker. With our FORCE platform, we have the flexibility to deploy different types of oligonucleotide payloads with specific mechanisms of action that modify target functions. We leverage this modularity to focus on muscle diseases with high unmet need, with etiologic targets and with clear translational potential from preclinical disease models to well-defined clinical development and regulatory pathways. Using our FORCE platform, we are assembling a broad portfolio of muscle disease therapeutics, including our lead programs in myotonic dystrophy type 1, or DM1, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, or FSHD. In addition, we plan to expand our portfolio through development efforts focused on rare skeletal muscle diseases, as well as cardiac and metabolic muscle diseases, including some with larger patient populations. Our programs are currently all in the preclinical stage. We expect to submit investigational new drug, or IND, applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for product candidates in each of our DM1, DMD and FSHD programs between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2022.
We were incorporated and commenced operations in 2017. Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, conducting research activities and filing and prosecuting patent applications. We do not have any products for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales or otherwise. To date, we have principally raised capital through sales of equity securities and borrowings under a loan and security agreement, or our loan agreement, with a commercial bank. On September 21, 2020, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 14,089,314 shares of our common stock, including 1,837,736 shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of $246.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. On January 25, 2021, we completed a follow-on public offering, which we refer to as the January 2021 offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,000,000 shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of $157.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more product candidates we may develop. For the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, we reported net losses of $14.9 million and $59.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $79.2 million.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our expenses and capital expenditures will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
•
continue our current research programs and conduct additional research programs;
•
advance any product candidates we identify through our research programs into IND-enabling studies and clinical trials;
•
expand the capabilities of our proprietary FORCE platform;
•
seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
obtain, expand, maintain, defend and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel;
•
establish manufacturing sources for any product candidate we may develop, including the Fab antibody, Val-cit linker and therapeutic payload that will comprise the product candidate, and secure supply chain capacity to provide sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical development and commercial supply;
•
ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval; and
•
add operational, legal, compliance, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our research, product development and future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our operations as a public company.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates we may develop. If we obtain regulatory approval for or otherwise commercialize any product candidates we may develop, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capabilities to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements or arrangements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development or future commercialization of one or more product candidates we may develop.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations at planned levels, and as a result we may be forced to substantially reduce or terminate our operations.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds from the January 2021 offering, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into the second half of 2024. We have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional
financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. See “-Liquidity and capital resources” below.
Impact of COVID-19 on our business
The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic may affect our ability to initiate and complete preclinical studies, delay the initiation of our future clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities or have other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, the pandemic has caused substantial disruption in the financial markets and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could adversely affect our business and operations.
To date, we have not experienced material business disruptions, including with our vendors, or impairments of any of our assets as a result of the pandemic. We are following, and plan to continue to follow, recommendations from federal, state and local governments regarding workplace policies, practices and procedures. In March 2020, we implemented a remote working policy for many of our employees and began restricting non-essential travel, and on May 18, 2020, when Massachusetts began its staged reopening plan, we began implementing a return-to-work plan, in accordance with the guidance and requirements of federal and state authorities. We expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other business partners. We are continuing to monitor the potential impact of the pandemic, but we cannot be certain what the overall impact will be on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Components of our results of operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts are successful and we commercialize products, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, as well as upfront, milestone and royalty payments from such collaboration or license agreements, or a combination thereof.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities and development of our programs. These expenses include:
•
development and operation of our proprietary FORCE platform;
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred in connection with our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs;
•
the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing materials for use in our research and preclinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;
•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
Our direct external research and development expenses consist of costs that include fees, reimbursed materials and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs in connection with our development and manufacturing activities. We do not allocate our research and development costs to specific programs because costs are deployed across multiple programs and our platform and, as such, are not separately classified.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities in the future as we advance our program candidates into IND-enabling studies and clinical trials. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop. The successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the following:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of programs we decide to pursue and their regulatory paths to market;
•
the need to raise funding to complete preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop;
•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements and the progress of the development efforts of third parties with whom we may enter into such arrangements;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new programs;
•
the successful initiation, enrollment and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for any product candidates;
•
the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of any product candidate we may develop;
•
establishing agreements with third-party manufacturers for supply of product candidate components for our clinical trials;
•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
•
our ability to protect our other rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•
commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•
obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement for any approved products.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any product candidate we may develop could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidate we may develop.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees in executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and
administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our growth strategy and move into our new facility in the second half of 2021. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with our operations as a public company. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate and do not enter into a third-party commercialization collaboration, we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales and marketing team to support product sales, marketing and distribution activities.
Interest income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We expect our interest income to increase as we invest the net proceeds received from our sale of Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock during 2020, the net proceeds from our IPO in September 2020 and the net proceeds from the January 2021 offering.
Interest expense
Interest expense consisted of interest on borrowings under our loan agreement as well as amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs. In October 2020, all outstanding borrowings under our loan agreement were repaid.
Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche obligations
Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement that we entered into with purchasers of our Series A preferred stock in November 2018, we were contingently obligated to sell, and the purchasers were contingently obligated to purchase, additional shares of Series A preferred stock upon the achievement of specified milestones.
These contingent rights and obligations, which we refer to as the Tranche Rights, were legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series A preferred stock. Therefore, we allocated the proceeds from the initial closing of the Series A preferred stock financing in November 2018 between the Tranche Rights (as a liability on the balance sheet) and the Series A preferred stock sold at the initial closing (within equity on the balance sheet). The Tranche Rights were subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded within other income (expense) on the statement of operations.
In September 2019, the Tranche Rights ceased to be remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Change in success fee obligation
Our loan agreement required us to pay a success fee upon the occurrence of a specified liquidity event, as defined in the agreement, which included our recently completed IPO. At inception of the loan agreement, this contingent obligation was considered immaterial. The fair value of this liability was remeasured at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expense) on the statement of operations. Upon the closing of our IPO, the success fee was paid and the remaining liability was eliminated.
Income taxes
Since our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in any year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of $69.1 million and $68.9 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are indefinite lived and the state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards $0.8 million and $0.4 million which begin to expire in 2039 and 2033, respectively.
Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. We have not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study. If we have experienced a change of control, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, which is determined by first multiplying the value of our common stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
Results of operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and development expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount in our research and development function. The increases in facility-related and other expenses and in costs for laboratory supplies and research materials were primarily due to the increased costs of supporting a larger group of research and development personnel and their research efforts. The increase in external manufacturing and research costs was primarily due to the development of our manufacturing process, increased research activity and the advancement of our programs.
General and administrative expenses
The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation expense was primarily the result of an increase in headcount in our general and administrative function. Professional and consulting fees increased primarily due to accounting, audit and legal services as well as costs associated with ongoing business activities and our preparations to operate as a public company.
Interest income
Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, due to interest earned on invested cash balances.
Interest expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.4 million due to interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our loan agreement. We did not incur any interest expense in the prior year period.
Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche obligations
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded other income of $1.3 million from a decrease in the fair value of our preferred stock tranche obligations resulting from the decrease in the fair value of the underlying Series A preferred stock. The remaining liability was reclassified to permanent equity in September 2019, and the obligations were no longer required to be remeasured.
Change in success fee obligation
The fair value of the success fee obligation included in our loan agreement increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 by $0.5 million. The obligation was settled in September 2020 and no longer requires recognition.
Liquidity and capital resources
Sources of liquidity
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we support our continued research activities and development of our programs and platform. We have not yet commercialized any product candidates, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of equity securities, borrowings under our loan agreement and, most recently, with proceeds from the sale of common stock in our IPO and the January 2021 offering. As of December 31, 2020 we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $345.3 million. On January 25, 2021, we completed a follow-on offering pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $28.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $157.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
Cash flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $46.5 million of cash, due to our net loss of $59.4 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.8 million and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $5.1 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $8.6 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $11.8 million of cash, due to our net loss of $14.9 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.8 million and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during these periods were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement of our research programs and the timing of vendor invoices and payments.
Investing activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $45.7 million due primarily to the purchases of marketable securities.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 million due to purchases of property and equipment during the period.
Financing activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $380.7 million, consisting of $246.4 million in aggregate net proceeds from our IPO in March 2019, $134.8 million in net proceeds from issuance of Preferred Stock, and an offset of $0.5 million in the settlement of our success fee obligation.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $20.0 million, consisting solely of the proceeds from our issuance of Series A preferred stock.
Funding requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our research programs into preclinical and clinical development and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:
•
the identification of additional research programs and product candidates;
•
the scope, progress, costs and results of preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we may develop;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of any product candidates we may develop;
•
our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;
•
changes in laws or regulations applicable to any product candidates we may develop, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;
•
the cost and timing of obtaining materials to produce adequate product supply for any preclinical or clinical development of any product candidate we may develop;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidate we may develop for which we obtain marketing approval;
•
the legal costs involved in prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;
•
additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, as well as the costs and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds from the January 2021 offering, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2024. We expect that our liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to submit INDs in each of our DM1, DMD and FSHD programs and achieve proof-of-concept data readouts in our DM1, DMD and FSHD programs. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or
declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements other arrangements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development or future commercialization of one or more of our product candidates we may develop. See Item 1A. “Risk factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.
Contractual obligations
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts typically do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are generally cancelable by us upon written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation and in the case of certain arrangements with CROs and CMOs may include non-cancelable fees.
We have also entered into a license agreement with the University of Mons under which we are obligated to make specified milestone and royalty payments. The payment obligations under this agreement are contingent upon future events, such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, or generating product sales. We are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. For additional information about our license agreement with the University of Mons and amounts that could become payable in the future under that agreement, see Item 1. “Business-Intellectual Property-License Agreement with the University of Mons” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In May 2019, we entered into a sublease agreement for a portion of our laboratory and office space. The term of the sublease commenced on July 1, 2019 and expires on December 31, 2021. Our lease payments for the remainder of the term of the sublease will be $0.1 million per month.
On December 4, 2020, we entered into a lease agreement for additional office and laboratory space. The lease has a term of 8.5 years, with lease payments that begin six months after the premises are ready for occupancy and will be $0.4 million per month, increasing up to $0.5 million during the term of the lease. We have two options to extend the term of the lease, each for a period of an additional five years. We expect the premises to be ready for occupancy in the second half of 2021.
Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued research and development expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;
•
CROs and investigative sites in connection with research activities; and
•
CMOs in connection with the production of research materials.
We measure the expense recognized based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the achievement of specified milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in changes in estimates that increase or decrease amounts recognized in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-based compensation
We measure stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options. Compensation expense for those awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We use the straight-line method to record the expense of awards with service-based vesting conditions. We use the graded-vesting method to record the expense of awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, commencing when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable.
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield.
Prior to our IPO, there was no public market for our common stock, and consequently, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering third-party valuations of our common stock as well as our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent third-party valuation through the date of the grant. Since our IPO, we have determined the fair market value of our common stock using the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Emerging growth company and smaller reporting company status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of these exemptions until December 31, 2025 or until such earlier time that we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies.
