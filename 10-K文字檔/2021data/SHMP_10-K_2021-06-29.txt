Corporate History
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 3, 2008 under the name “Multiplayer Online Dragon, Inc.” Effective November 5, 2010, we effected an 8-for-1 forward stock split, increasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 12,000,000 shares to 96,000,000 shares. On October 29, 2014, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, decreasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 97,000,000 to 9,700,000.
On November 26, 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“NSH”), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of NSH which assets consisted primarily of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of NSC and NS Global, and certain real property located outside of San Antonio, Texas (the “Assets”).
On January 30, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of the Assets pursuant to the Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, we issued 75,520,240 shares of our common stock to NSH as consideration for the Assets. As a result of the transaction, NSH acquired 88.62% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock; NSC and NS Global became our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and we changed our principal business to a global shrimp farming company.
In connection with our receipt of approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), effective March 3, 2015, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to “NaturalShrimp Incorporated.”
Business Overview
We are a biotechnology company and has developed proprietary platform technologies that allow us to grow Pacific White shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled, high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and independent production facilities. Our system uses technology which allows us to produce a naturally grown shrimp “crop” weekly, and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. We have developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows us to produce commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors, and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity, and temperature for optimal shrimp production. Our initial production facility is located outside of San Antonio, Texas.
On October 16, 2015, we formed Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc. (“NAS”). The purpose of the NAS is to formalize the business relationship between our Company and F&T Water Solutions LLC for the joint development of certain water technologies. The technologies shall include, without limitation, any and all inventions, patents, intellectual property, and know-how dealing with enclosed aquatic production systems worldwide. This includes construction, operation, and management of enclosed aquatic production, other than shrimp, facilities throughout the world, co-developed by both parties at our facility located outside of La Coste, Texas. On December 25, 2018, we were awarded U.S. Patent “Recirculating Aquaculture System and Treatment Method for Aquatic Species” covering all indoor aquatic species that utilizes proprietary art.
The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, NSC and NS Global and owns 51% of NAS.
Material Events During the Year
On December 15, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) between VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“VBF”), VBF Transport, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Transport”), and Iowa’s First, Inc., an Iowa corporation (“Iowa’s First”) (each a “Seller” and collectively, “Sellers”). Transport and Iowa’s First were wholly-owned subsidiaries of VBF. The agreement called for the Company to purchase all of the tangible assets of VBF, the motor vehicles of Transport and the real property (together with all plants, buildings, structures, fixtures, fittings, systems and other improvements located on such real property) of Iowa’s First. The consideration was $10,000,000, consisting of $5,000,000 in cash, paid at closing on December 17, 2020, (ii) $3,000,000 payable in 36 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date, and (iii) $2,000,000 payable in 48 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid to VBF as a balloon payment on the maturity date. The Company also agreed to issue 500,000 shares of common stock as a finder’s fee, with a fair value of $136,000 based on the market value of the common stock as of the closing date of the acquisition.
The facility was originally designed as an aquaculture facility. The Company has begun a modification process to convert the plant to produce shrimp, which will allow them to scale faster without having to build new facilities. The three Iowa facilities contain the tanks and infrastructure that will be used to support the production of shrimp with the incorporation of the Company’s patented EC platform technology.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended March 31, 2021 to the Year Ended March 31, 2020
Revenue
We have not earned any significant revenues since our inception and, although we expect revenues to begin in fiscal year 2022, we can provide no assurances as to how significant they will be at that time.
Expenses
Our expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 are summarized as follows, in comparison to our expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020:
Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $3,301,254, an increase of approximately 57% as compared to operating expenses for the same period in 2020. The overall change in expenses is mainly due to the increase in professional fees, facility operations and other general and administrative expenses, as well as depreciation, offset by the decrease in research and development between the periods. The increase in professional fees is due to an increase in legal fees period during the period related in part to the warrant settlement with Vista Capital Investments, LLC, the VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. acquisition and the new Series D Preferred Stock, and an increase in accounting and consulting fees over the same period in the previous year. The increase of approximately $171,000 in facility operations is a result of the fire on March 18, 2020, at our pilot production plant, which is currently in the process of being rebuilt, with additional amounts also spent on testing and startup operations. The increase in depreciation is due to the asset acquisition with VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc., during December 2020. In the year ending March 31, 2020, the Company was progressing with its testing and planning to begin commercial operations, which had resulted in a ramp-up of costs compared to prior periods. Additionally, the Company’s 51%-owned subsidiary, NAS, began activities during the fiscal year 2020, which included costs for research and development of their technology and the treatment lab. All other costs between periods are fairly consistent.
Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2021, we had cash on hand of approximately $156,000 and a working capital deficiency of approximately $3,614,000, as compared to cash on hand of approximately $109,000 and a working capital deficiency of approximately $3,598,000 as of March 31, 2020. While the working capital deficiency for the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to 2020 is fairly consistent, it is mainly due to an approximately $344,000 decrease in current assets, offset by an approximately $328,000 decrease in current liabilities, as discussed in further detail below.
The change in current liabilities is a result of decreases in convertible debt and the related derivatives due to the full conversions of approximately $504,000 of convertible debt, the Vista Capital Investments, LLC settlement in April of 2020, which was accrued as of March 31, 2020 and which consisted of $560,000 in accrued expenses and $90,000 in warrant liability, as well as the issuance of a related party note to the wife of our late former CEO (Bill Williams) in exchange for the amounts owed under the late Mr. William’s settlement agreement, a portion of which in now non-current.
Working Capital Deficiency
Our working capital deficiency as of March 31, 2021, in comparison to our working capital deficiency as of March 31, 2020, can be summarized as follows:
The decrease in current assets is due to the receipt of the insurance settlement of approximately $917,000 which was in current assets as of March 31, 2020, offset by an increase in prepaid expense. The increase in the prepaid expense is due to shares issued to a consultant for services to be provided over a six-month term, with three months remaining as of March 31, 2021. The decrease in current liabilities is primarily due to the decrease in accrued expenses, which as of March 31, 2020 included the Vista Capital Investments, LLC warrant settlement consisting of common shares to be issued, with a fair value of $560,000, plus the cash payment to them of $75,000 on April 10, 2020, with the issuance of the shares of the Company’s common stock occurring in the current period, along with the reclassification of the $90,000 warrant liability to equity upon cancellation of the Vista Capital Investments, LLC warrants. Additionally, the issuance of the related party note to the relative of Mr. Williams, in exchange for the amounts owed under the late Mr. William’s settlement agreement, also resulted in a decrease to current liabilities as a portion of the new note payable in now non-current. In the current fiscal year, there was also $463,000 of principal of convertible notes outstanding, net of debt discounts, as of March 31, 2020 and the related reclassification to equity of the total derivative liability upon conversion, which is offset by the new $720,000 convertible note entered into in February of 2021, net of its discount of approximately $284,000. Lastly, there also is an increase of approximately $322,000 in accounts payable.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2021, in comparison to our cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2020, can be summarized as follows:
The decrease in net cash used in operating activities in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 is attributable partly due to the decrease in the net loss, as well as the approximately $745,000 fair value of the shares issued for services, and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the asset acquisition. There also was the decrease in accrued expenses, which was a result of the $635,000 settlement with Vista Capital Investments, LLC and in accrued interest due to related parties, stemming from the issuance of the new note payable in settlement of the late Mr. Williams separation agreement. This is offset in the current period of a reduced amortization of debt discount, which was approximately $530,000 higher in the prior period.
The net cash used in investing activities in the year ended March 31, 2021 includes $5,000,000 in cash paid for the VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. asset acquisition, as well as $3,455,000 paid for machinery and equipment and construction in process to rebuild our La Coste facility and is offset by the $917,210 of cash proceeds received from the insurance settlement for the fire to the pilot production plant. In the same period in 2020, the Company used cash for investing activities to purchase machinery and equipment for the La Coste facility prior to the March 2020 fire.
The net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately $6,274,000 between periods. For the current period, the Company received $3,250,000 from the sale of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $6,050,000 from the sale of Series D Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, and $600,000 from a new convertible debenture, as well as $103,200 from a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan, which is expected to be forgiven, and $50,000 connected to the Vista Capital Investments, LLC warrant settlement. In the same period in the prior year, the financing activities primarily arose from the proceeds received from the equity financing agreement of $1,774,000 and $2,250,000 from the sale of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and $100,000 proceeds from a new convertible debenture in April of 2019, offset by payments made on the credit line and convertible debentures in fiscal 2020.
Our cash position was approximately $312,000 as of March 31, 2021. Management believes that our cash on hand and working capital are not sufficient to meet our current anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, as more fully described below.

Bank Loan
On April 10, 2020, the Company obtained a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan in the amount of $103,200 pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). Interest on the loan is at the rate of 1% per year, and all loan payments are deferred for nine months, at which time the balance is payable in 18 monthly installments if not forgiven in accordance with the CARES Act and the terms of the promissory note executed by the Company in connection with the loan. The promissory note contains events of default and other provisions customary for a loan of this type. As required, the Company used the PPP Loan proceeds for payroll, healthcare benefits, and utilities. The program provides that the use of PPP Loan amount shall be limited to certain qualifying expenses and may be partially or wholly forgiven in accordance with the requirements set forth in the CARES Act. On April 16, 2021, the Company filed for the forgiveness of the PPP Loan and then received forgiveness on April 26, 2021.
On January 10, 2017, the Company entered into a promissory note with Community National Bank for $245,000, at an annual interest rate of 5% and a maturity date of January 10, 2020 (the “CNB Note”). The CNB Note is secured by certain real property owned by the Company in LaCoste, Texas, and is also personally guaranteed by the Company’s President, as well as certain shareholders of the Company. On January 10, 2020, the loan was modified, with certain terms amended. The modified note is for the principal balance of $222,736, with initial monthly payments of $1,730 through February 1, 2037, when all unpaid principal and interest will be due and payable. The loan has an initial yearly rate of interest of 5.75%, which may change beginning on February 1, 2023 and each 36 months thereafter, to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus 1%, but never below 4.25%. The monthly payments may change on the same dates as the interest changes. The Company is also allowed to make payments against the principal at any time. The balance of the CNB Note was $214,852 as of March 31, 2021, $8,725 of which was in current liabilities, and $222,736 as of March 31, 2020, of which $8,904 was in current liabilities.
On November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a short-term note agreement with Community National Bank for a total value of $50,000, with a maturity date of December 15, 2017. On July 18, 2018, the short-term note was replaced by a promissory note for the outstanding balance of $25,298, which bears interest at 8% with a maturity date of July 18, 2021. The note is guaranteed by an officer and director. The balance of the note as of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 was $3,124 and $12,005, respectively.
Convertible Debentures
On February 26, 2021, the Company entered into a convertible note for the principal amount of $720,000, with an original issue discount of $120,000, convertible into shares of common stock of the Company. The note bears interest of 12% and is due six months from the date of issuance. The note is convertible from the date of issuance, at a fixed conversion rate of $0.36. The conversion rate shall change to $0.10 upon the event of default. The conversion feature at issuance meets the definition of conventional convertible debt and therefore qualifies for the scope exception in ASC 815-10-15-74(a) and would not be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative liability. The Company analyzed the conversion feature under ASC 470-20, “Debt with conversion and other options,” and based on the market price of the common stock of the Company on the date of funding as compared to the conversion price, determined there was an approximately $164,000 beneficial conversion feature to recognize, which will be amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest method. The amortization of the beneficial conversion feature was $27,273 and the original issuance discount was $20,000, for the year ended March 31, 2021.
On March 1, 2019, the Company entered into a 10% convertible promissory note for $168,000, with an OID of $18,000, for a purchase price of $150,000, which originally matured on November 1, 2019. The maturity date was extended to September 1, 2020, with the noteholders waiving the default penalties through December 31, 2020. In the event of default, as set forth in the agreement, the outstanding principal balance increases to 150%. The note is convertible at a fixed conversion price of $0.25. If an event of default occurs, the fixed conversion price is extinguished and replaced by a variable conversion rate that is 70% of the lowest trading prices during the 20 days prior to conversion. The fixed conversion price shall reset upon any future dilutive issuance of shares, options or convertible securities. The conversion feature at issuance meets the definition of conventional convertible debt and therefore qualifies for the scope exception in ASC 815-10-15-74(a) and would not be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative liability. The Company analyzed the conversion feature under ASC 470-20, “Debt with conversion and other options”, and based on the market price of the common stock of the Company on the date of funding as compared to the conversion price, determined there was a $134,000 beneficial conversion feature to recognize, which was amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest method. and fully amortized during the year ended March 31, 2020. On December 21, 2020, the outstanding balance of $168,000 and accrued interest of $30,847 was converted into 795,387 shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion rate of $0.25.
Notes Payable
On December 15, 2020, in connection with the asset acquisition with Vero Blue Farms USA, Inc., the Company entered into two notes payable. The first note, Promissory Note A, is for principal of $3,000,000, which is payable in 36 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid as a balloon payment on the maturity date. Promissory Note B, is for principal of $2,000,000, which is payable in 48 months with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annuum, interest only payable quarterly on the first day of the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid as a balloon payment on the maturity date.
On July 15, 2020, the Company issued a promissory note to a relative of the late Bill Williams (our former CEO) in the amount of $383,604 to settle the amounts that had been recognized per the separation agreement with the late Mr. Williams dated August 15, 2019 for his portion of the related party notes and related accrued interest discussed above, and accrued compensation and allowances. The note bears interest at one percent per annum and calls for monthly payments of $8,000 until the balance is paid in full. The balance as of March 31, 2021 was $311,604, with $96,000 classified in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Sale and Issuance of Common Stock
During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company issued 39,735,627 shares of the Company’s common stock upon conversion of approximately $551,000 of their outstanding convertible debt and accrued interest.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company has converted 5,008 shares of Series B Preferred Stock including dividends-in-kind into 113,517,030 shares of the Company’s common stock.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company has converted 5,008 Series B PS including dividends-in-kind into 113,517,030 shares of the Company’s common stock.
Common Shares Issued to Consultants
On August 24, 2020, the Company issued 1,500,000 shares of common stock to a consultant per an agreement entered into on June 25, 2020. The agreement has a six-month term, and therefore the fair value of $67,500, based on the market value of $0.045 on the grant date, will be recognized over the term of the agreement, with $67,500 expensed during the year ended March 31, 2021. On December 25, 2020, the Company renewed the agreement for an additional six months. As consideration for the agreement, the Company issued 1,500,000 shares of common stock to the consultant. The agreement has a six-month term, and therefore the fair value of $616,500, based on the market value of $0.041 on the grant date, is recognized in prepaid expense to be amortized over the six-month term. As of the year end March 31, 2021, $308,250 remained in prepaid expense with $308,250 recognized in consulting expense for the year end March 31, 2021.
On June 12, 2020, the Company issued 1,250,000 shares of common stock to a consultant, with the fair value of $61,250 based on the market price of $0.049 on the date issued and which was recognized as professional services in the three months ended June 30, 2020.
Series B Preferred Equity Offering
On September 5, 2019, the board of directors of the Company authorized the issuance of 5,000 preferred shares to be designated as Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B PS have a par value of $0.0001, a stated value of $1,200 and no voting rights. The Series B PS are redeemable at the Company's option, at percentages ranging from 120% to 135% for the first 180 days, based on the passage of time. The Series B are also redeemable at the holder’s option, upon the occurrence of a triggering event which includes a change of control, bankruptcy, and the inability to deliver Series B PS requested under conversion notices. The triggering redemption amount is at the greater of (i) 135% of the stated value or (ii) the product of the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) on the day proceeding the triggering event multiplied by the stated value divided by the conversion price. As the redemption feature at the holder’s option is contingent on a future triggering event, the Series B PS is considered contingently redeemable, and as such the preferred shares are classified in equity until such time as a triggering event occurs, at which time they will be classified as mezzanine.
The Series B PS is convertible, at the discounted market price which is defined as the lowest VWAP over last 20 days. The conversion price is adjustable based on several situations, including future dilutive issuances. As the Series B PS does not have a redemption date and is perpetual preferred stock, it is considered to be an equity host instrument and as such the conversion feature is not required to be bifurcated as it is clearly and closely related to the equity host instrument.
On September 17, 2019, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with GHS Investments LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“GHS”) for the purchase of up to 5,000 shares of Series B PS at a stated value of $1,200 per share, or for a total net proceeds of $5,000,000 in the event the entire 5,000 shares of Series B PS are purchased. During the year ended March 31, 2021 the Company received $3,250,000 for the issuance of 3,250 Series B PS. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion option on several of the tranches was calculated at a total of $1,335,000, which was fully amortized upon issuance, as the Series B PS is immediately convertible into common stock. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company has converted 5,008 Series B PS which includes 115 Series B PS dividends-in-kind into 113,517,030 shares of the Company’s common stock.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company issued 2,250 Series B Preferred Shares in various tranches of the SPA, totaling $2,250,000. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion option on several of the tranches was calculated at a total of $475,000, which was fully amortized upon issuance, as the Series B PS is immediately convertible into common stock.
Series D Preferred Equity Offering
On December 16, 2020, the Board authorized the issuance of 20,000 preferred shares to be designated as Series D Preferred Stock (“Series D PS”). The Series D PS have a par value of $0.0001, a stated value of $1,200 and will vote together with the common stock on an as-converted basis. In addition, as further described in the Series D Designation, as long as any of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company will not take certain corporate actions without the affirmative vote at a meeting (or the written consent with or without a meeting) of the majority of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding. On December 18, 2020, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements (the “Purchase Agreement”) with GHS Investments LLC, Platinum Point Capital LLC and BHP Capital NY (collectively, the “Purchaser”) , whereby, at the closing, each Purchaser agreed to purchase from the Company, up to 5,000 shares of the Company’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred Stock. The aggregate purchase price per Purchaser for the Series D Preferred Stock is $5,000,000. In connection with the sale of the Series D Preferred Stock, the Purchasers received 6,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Commitment Shares”), which have a fair value of $1,616,250 based on the market price of the common shares of $0.27 on the date of the Series D PS purchase. On January 8 and 10, 2021, the Company entered into additional securities purchase agreements with the Purchaser, for 1,050 shares of Series D PS, at an aggregate purchase price of $1,050,000.
Each holder of Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding and held by such holder, dividends at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum (the “Preferred Dividends”). Dividends may be paid in cash or in shares of Preferred Stock at the discretion of the Company.
The Series D PS are convertible into Common Stock at the election of the holder of the Series D PS at any time following five days after a qualified offering (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) at a 35% discount to the offering price, or, if a qualified offering has not occurred, at a price of $0.10 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the designation.
The Series BD PS shall be redeemed by the Corporation on the date that is no later than one calendar year from the date of its issuance. The Series D PS are also redeemable at the Company's option, at percentages ranging from 115% to 125% for the first 180 days, based on the passage of time. The Company shall redeem the Series D PS in cash upon a three business days prior notice to the holder or the holder may convert the Series D PS within such three business days period prior to redemption. Additionally, the holder shall have the right to either redeem for cash or convert the Preferred Stock into Common Stock within three business days following the consummation of a qualified offering. The Series D PS are also redeemable at the holder’s option, upon the occurrence of a triggering event which includes a change of control, bankruptcy, and the inability to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock requested under conversion notices. The triggering redemption amount is 150% of the stated value.
We used the proceeds of an offering that closed on April 14, 2021 to redeem 2,450 shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by two holders for a total of $3,658,000. In a concurrent private placement, we exchanged 3,600 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock held by GHS for 3,739.63 shares of the Company’s newly designated Series E Preferred Stock. As of April 14, 2021, there were no shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding.
Going Concern
The audited consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared, assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated losses through the period to March 31, 2021 of approximately $53,683,000 as well as negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately $2,377,000. Presently, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources to meet its plans in the twelve months following the date of issuance of this filing. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of evaluating various financing alternatives in order to finance the continued build-out of our equipment and for general and administrative expenses. These alternatives include raising funds through public or private equity markets and either through institutional or retail investors. Although there is no assurance that the Company will be successful with our fund-raising initiatives, management believes that the Company will be able to secure the necessary financing as a result of ongoing financing discussions with third party investors and existing shareholders.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights, preferences and privileges of the Company’s common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations.
Future Financing
We will require additional funds to implement our growth strategy for our business. In addition, while we have received capital from various private placements that have enabled us to fund our operations, these funds have been largely used to develop our processes, although additional funds are needed for other corporate operational and working capital purposes. However, not including funds needed for capital expenditures or to pay down existing debt and trade payables, we anticipate that we will need to raise an additional $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 to cover all of our operational expenses over the next 12 months, not including any capital expenditures needed as part of any commercial scale-up of our equipment. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional necessary financing on a timely basis, or if we are unable to generate significant revenues from operations, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due, and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Effects of Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. We believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
Fair Value Measurement
The fair value measurement guidance clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in the valuation of an asset or liability. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the fair value measurement guidance are described below:
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or
Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
The Company did not have any Level 1 or Level 2 assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.
The Derivative liabilities are Level 3 fair value measurements.
Basic and Diluted Earnings/Loss per Common Share
Basic and diluted earnings or loss per share (“EPS”) amounts in the consolidated financial statements are computed in accordance with ASC 260 - 10 “Earnings per Share”, which establishes the requirements for presenting EPS. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (denominator) during the period. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company had a 607 shares of Series B PS whose approximately 1,202,000 underlying shares are convertible at the investors’ option at a conversion price based on the lowest market price over the last 20 trading days, and 6,050 of Series D PS whose approximately 60,050,000 underlying shares are convertible at the investors’ option at a fixed conversion price of $0.10, which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $469,000 in convertible debentures whose approximately 12,518,000 underlying shares are convertible at the holders’ option at conversion prices ranging from $0.01 to $0.25 for fixed conversion rates, and 57% - 60% of the defined trading price for variable conversion rates, and approximately 2,916,000 warrants with an exercise price of 45% of the market price of the Company’s common stock, which were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Long-lived Assets
The Company will periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant such a review and at least annually. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Our recently adopted accounting pronouncements are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included herein for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, that requires entities to account for beneficial conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock; (2) revises the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and embedded features that are both indexed to the issuer’s own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity, by removing certain criteria required for equity classification; and (3) revises the guidance in ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, to require entities to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In addition, entities must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and cannot adopt the guidance in an interim reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2020-06 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
As of March 31, 2021, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
