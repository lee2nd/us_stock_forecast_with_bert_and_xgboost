OVERVIEW
Ebix endeavors to provide on-demand software and e-commerce services to the insurance, financial, healthcare and e-learning industries. In the Insurance sector, the Company’s main focus is to develop and deploy globally a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis, while also providing SaaS enterprise solutions in the area of CRM, front-end & back-end systems, outsourced administrative and risk compliance. The P&C exchanges operate primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. With a "Phygital” strategy that combines over 320,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many (“ASEAN”) countries, to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in the areas of domestic and international money remittance, Forex, travel, pre-paid & gift cards, utility payments, software solutions for lending and wealth management etc., in India and other markets. The Company’s Forex Exchange has the leading market share within India’s airport foreign exchange business and encompasses 20 international airports, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata International airports, all of which combined conducting over $4.8 billion in gross transaction value annually (pre-COVID-19). EbixCash’s inward remittance business in India conducts gross annual remittance of approximately $5 billion annually (pre-COVID-19) and is the clear market leader. EbixCash, through its travel portfolio of Via and Mercury, is one of Southeast Asia’s leading travel exchanges, with over 200,000 agents, 25 branches and over 9,800 corporate clients, combined processing an estimated $2.5 billion in gross merchandise value per annum (pre-COVID-19). Through its various SaaS-based software platforms, Ebix employs thousands of domain-specific technology professionals to provide products, support and consultancy to thousands of customers on six continents.
Ebix provides application software products for the insurance industry, including carrier systems, agency systems and exchanges, as well as custom software development. Approximately 88% of the Company’s revenues are either recurring or repeating (transaction-based) in nature. Rather than license our products in perpetuity, we typically either license them for multiple years with ongoing support revenues or license them on a limited term basis using a subscription hosting or Application Service Provider ("ASP") model. Combined subscription-based and transaction-based revenues of $552 million comprised 88% of the Company's total revenues in 2020, as compared to 84% of total revenues in 2019. In 2020, subscription-based revenues decreased by approximately $14 million to $164 million, and as a percentage of the Company's total revenues was 26% in 2020 versus 31% in 2019. The Company has modified the classification of certain revenues in 2020, which impacts the presentation of 2019 revenues and percentages above versus the 2019 10-K presentation.
The Company’s technology vision is to converge processes in a manner such that data can seamlessly flow between entities after an initial data entry has been made. Our customers include many of the top insurance and financial sector companies in the world.
The insurance and financial markets continue to focus on initiatives to reduce paper-based processes and facilitate improvements in efficiency, both on the back end of transactions as well as at the consumer-involved front end of transaction processes. This drive for efficiency involves all entities and directly impacts the manner in which insurance and financial products are distributed. Management believes that both the insurance and financial services industries will continue to
experience significant change and increased efficiencies through online exchanges as reduced paper-based processes are becoming increasingly the norm across the world insurance and financial markets.
Trends and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, COVID-19 was reported and has spread globally, including to every state in the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the U.S. government declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments implemented travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and similar government orders and restrictions, in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. Such restrictions or orders, or the perception that such restrictions or orders could be implemented, resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, and the cancellation or postponement of events.
Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We have not experienced a material impact from shifting our employees to a remote work environment, which we primarily attribute to the professionalism of our workforce and our extensive use of technology throughout our business. However, COVID-19 could negatively impact the productivity of our workforce if the pandemic requires prolonged remote working conditions.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, particularly beginning in March, we experienced a decrease in demand for certain of our solutions and services, particularly those related to the Company's travel, foreign exchange, remittance, e-learning and consulting business areas, after certain government restrictions were implemented. This decreased demand continued throughout 2020 in varying degrees for each business area, and even persists through the date of this filing for all of the above mentioned business areas, but most notably in the travel and foreign exchange businesses. We expect that demand variability for our products and services will continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cannot predict with any certainty when demand for these solutions/services will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.
We continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19 and remain flexible in our response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. Along with the measures mentioned above to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have also taken steps to strengthen our financial position to mitigate the adverse impact that COVID-19 has had or may have on our business and operations, including amending our Credit Facility, reducing salaries for certain employees, furloughing employees in the most negatively impacted business areas, eliminating certain employee positions, and eliminating, reducing, or deferring non-essential expenditures. Additionally, we have taken steps to preserve cash balances, including a temporary cessation to our share repurchase program.
Our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be reflective of current market conditions, or of our results for any future periods, which may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent than the reported period. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete description of the material risks that the Company currently faces.
Key Performance Indicators
Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor the Company's operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share, and cash provided by operating activities. We monitor these indicators, in conjunction with our corporate governance practices, to ensure efficient management of our business and maintenance of effective controls.
The MD&A discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Form 10-K, but can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.
The key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
Operating Revenue
The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to products or services delivered over our exchanges or from our ASP, fees for business process outsourcing services, and fees for software development projects, including fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems, e-governance solutions to governmental agencies in the health and education sectors, as well as foreign exchange, remittance (both inward and outward) and travel services from our financial exchanges.
Ebix’s revenue streams come from three product/service channels. Presented in the table below is the breakout of our revenues for each of those product/service channels for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
In the table above for the year ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 there are $13.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of Insurance Exchange revenues derived in India that are being reported within the EbixCash Exchange channel above.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our total revenue increased $45.0 million, or 8%, to $625.6 million compared to $580.6 million in 2019. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Across the U.S. and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. Countries across the world are re-opening economies, but are doing so in phases that differ in each country and, in many cases, within individual countries. While our travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses continue to be materially negatively impacted by COVID-19, the increase in 2020 total revenue year-over-year was due primarily to strong demand for the Company's payment solutions offerings in India (primarily prepaid gift cards), which increased by more than $200 million year-over-year to approximately $256 million, or 590% year-over-year growth. The increased demand for prepaid gift cards in India was primarily due to: (i) changes in regulations by the Reserve Bank of India related to debit cards, which has shifted demand in the market towards prepaid gift cards; (ii) COVID-19, which has facilitated increased online and electronic commerce due to restrictive lockdowns in 2020; and (iii) the Company's increased marketing efforts around the prepaid gift card business. The Company’s travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses had a year-over-year decline in revenues in 2020 in excess of $150 million, an approximately 65% decline year-over-year, which offset the growth in the payments solutions business.
The impact from fluctuations of the exchange rates for the foreign currencies in the countries in which we conduct operations also adversely affected reported revenue. During each of the years 2020 and 2019 the change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported consolidated operating revenue by $(21.9) million and $(9.3) million, respectively. Thus, on a constant currency basis total revenue for the fiscal year 2020 increased approximately 12% year-over-year.
The specific components of our revenue based on our three main business lines and the changes experienced during the past year are discussed immediately below.
Overall Exchange revenues increased $56.4 million, or 11%, as explained below:
•Insurance Exchange division revenues decreased by $12.0 million, or 6%, principally due to challenges faced in our health content services channel, and the negative effect of foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening U.S. dollar
•EbixCash Exchange division revenues increased $68.3 million, or 21%, due to a mix of organic growth and business acquisitions in the travel, foreign exchange, and software solutions sectors, offset by foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening of the US Dollar.
•Risk Compliance Solutions division revenues decreased by $11.4 million, or 16%, primarily due to a decline in our U.S. professional consulting services associated with some major realignments in the sector.
International revenue accounted for 73% and 69% of the Company’s total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Costs of Services Provided
Costs of services provided, which includes costs associated with product sales, customer support, consulting, implementation, and training services increased $138.1 million, or 67%, from $205.2 million in 2019 to $343.3 million in 2020 and the Company's gross margin decreased to 45.1% in 2020 from 64.7% in 2019. The increase in costs of services provided and the decrease in gross margin from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 is directly related to the increase in over $200 million in revenue within the Company’s payment solutions business (primarily gift card revenue) in fiscal years 2020 versus 2019. Payment solutions gross margins are significantly lower than other solutions and services the Company provides its customers. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the payment solutions gross margins for the Company were approximately 1% and 9.5%, respectively. Excluding the payment solutions business, gross margins for the Company in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were approximately 76% and 68%, respectively. The increase in gross margins, excluding the payment solutions business, in fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 was driven by the revenue mix differences for the Company, with the Company’s highest margin solutions/services (e.g. insurance exchange software and services) experiencing less relative negative impact from COVID-19 during 2020 versus other solutions/services (e.g. travel, foreign exchange and remittance businesses).
Product Development Expenses
The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the development of new technologies for insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the development of new data exchanges for use in domestic and international insurance markets, as well as the Forex and travel sectors. Product development expenses decreased $10.0 million, or 22%, from $45.3 million in 2019 to $35.3 million in 2020. The decrease is due to reduced personnel costs and is directly related to actions taken by management to reduce overall corporate expenditures in fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 in response to COVID-19.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.7 million, or 29%, from $19.6 million in 2019 to $13.8 million in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to reduced advertising and marketing costs in response to COVID-19.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses decreased $52.9 million, or 38%, from $140.4 million in 2019 to $87.5 million in 2020. This decrease was driven mostly by management’s strategic response to COVID-19 to reduce overall corporate costs, as well as material rent reductions and abatements as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, personnel-related costs decreased approximately $28 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 2019, and rent expense in fiscal year 2020 was approximately $23 million less than in fiscal year 2019. Other items impacting the year-to-year comparison of G&A expenses include a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately $12 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the $12.1 million accounts receivable reserve that was recognized in the third quarter of 2019 as a precautionary measure in regards to receivables that are due from a public sector entity in India and that were billed during the 2016 through 2019 operating periods. Additionally, in 2019 the Company reduced the acquisition earn out accrual for the ItzCash acquisition by $15.4 million, which served to decrease overall G&A expenses in 2019. The one-time accounts receivable reserve of $12.1 million (increased G&A expense) and the $15.4 million earn out accrual reduction (reduced G&A expense) largely offset the impacts to overall G&A expense in fiscal year 2019.
Amortization and Depreciation Expenses
Amortization and depreciation expenses decreased $730 thousand, or 5%, to $13.7 million in 2020 from $14.5 million in 2019 primarily due to lower amortization in 2020 versus 2019 related to definite lived intangibles resulting from prior acquisition activity, primarily in India.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased $462 thousand, or 73%, from $629 thousand in 2019 to $167 thousand in 2020 primarily due to decreases in the comparative balances in interest bearing accounts and overall lower interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $10.8 million, or 25% from $42.3 million in 2019 to $31.6 million in 2020, primarily due to decrease LIBOR interest rates in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, The Company’s working capital facilities in India had average balances that were approximately $30 million lower in 2020 versus 2019. These working capital facilities generally carry interest rates of between 6.75% and 9.45%. The decrease in working capital facilities was associated with both COVID-19's impact on operations and renegotiated customer agreements that improved the Company’s payment terms in 2020 relative to 2019.
Foreign Exchange Loss
Net foreign exchange loss of $387 thousand in 2020 which consisted of net losses realized and unrealized upon the settlement of receivables or payables and re-measurement of cash balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective operating division recording the instrument. In fiscal year 2019, a net foreign currency exchange loss of $2.4 million was recorded.
Income Taxes
The Company recognized income tax expense of $5.3 million in 2020 compared to $0.2 million of income tax expense in 2019, representing an increase of $5.1 million. Our effective tax rate increased to 5.7% in 2020, compared with 0.2% in 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 is due to a decrease in the availability of tax credits in 2020 as compared to 2019, as well as a lower tax holiday benefit available in 2020 compared to 2019 and a lower benefit from state tax deductions.
The pre-tax income from and the applicable statutory tax rates in each jurisdiction in which the Company had operations for the year ending December 31, 2020 are as follows:
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by our operating activities, and cash and cash equivalents on hand.
We intend to continue to utilize cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities, in combination with the possible issuance of additional debt or equity, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, to make strategic business acquisitions, to retire outstanding indebtedness, and to repurchase shares of our common stock if and as market and operating conditions warrant.
We believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash balances and access to credit and the capital markets, if required, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months, although any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and the general market conditions for credit and equity securities is subject to substantial uncertainty. In the event additional liquidity needs arise, we may raise funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. However, there are no assurances that such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the covenants in our Credit Facility could adversely affect our ability to obtain such financing and our ability to make strategic acquisitions, fund investments, repurchase shares of our common stock or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.
We regularly evaluate our liquidity requirements, including the need for additional debt or equity offerings, when considering potential business acquisitions, or the development of new products or services. During fiscal year 2021, the Company intends to utilize its cash and other financing resources to fund organic growth initiatives, strategic business acquisitions, and new product development initiatives and service offerings.
Our cash and cash equivalents were $105.0 million and $73.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company holds material cash and cash equivalent balances overseas in foreign jurisdictions. The free flow of cash from certain countries where we hold such balances may be subject to repatriation tax effects and other restrictions. Furthermore, the repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries would result in the application of withholding taxes at source and taxation at the U.S. parent level upon receipt of the repatriation amounts. The approximate cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments balances held in our domestic U.S. operations and each of our foreign subsidiaries as of April 19, 2021 is presented in the table below (figures denominated in thousands):
Our current ratio increased from 1.55 at December 31, 2019 to 1.89 at December 31, 2020, and our working capital position increased to $170.5 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $129.0 million at the end of 2019. The increase in our short-term liquidity position is primarily due to the following factors: (a) an approximately $91 million reduction in cash used for acquisitions in 2020 as compared to 2019; (b) a decrease in trade accounts receivable and accounts receivable from service providers at December 31, 2020 versus December 31, 2019 of approximately $24 million; and (c) partially offset by an approximately $44 million decrease in current liabilities during 2020, an increase in short-term investments of approximately $21 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, and a decrease in the Company's working capital facilities at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 of approximately $12 million. We believe that our ability to generate sustainable robust cash flow from operations will enable the Company to continue to meet its debt obligations and to fund its current liabilities from current assets, including available cash balances.
Business Combinations
The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions in combination with organic growth initiatives as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy. The Company looks to acquire businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services.
During the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, the Company completed two business acquisition as follows:
Effective May 4, 2020, Ebix acquired from bankruptcy India-based Trimax, which provides IT and integration services to state-owned transport corporations, operates data centers, and is an IT infrastructure solution provider, for approximately $9.9 million of upfront consideration. Additionally, Ebix issued preferred shares in Trimax to the selling shareholders that can be sold five years from the closing of the acquisition based on an independent valuation performed by a Big 4 valuation firm. The maximum value of the preferred shares upon sale is approximately $9.9 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.
In October 1, 2020 the Company acquired a 70% interest in AssureEdge Global Services (“AssureEdge”) for a total purchase price of approximately $5.0 million, including net working capital acquired. AssureEdge is a pan-India based BPO company, with a variety of BPO offerings via six contact centers across the country. It serves a number of industries and clients that have cross-selling value for EbixCash services. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable, but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed three business acquisitions, as follows:
Effective August 23, 2019, Ebix acquired Canada based Wallstreet Canada foreign exchange and outward remittance markets for approximately $2.1 million of upfront consideration plus net working capital.
Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired the assets of India based Essel Forex, for approximately $8.7 million, plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $721 thousand based on earned revenues. Ebix funded the entire transaction in cash, using its internal cash reserves. Essel Forex is a large provider of foreign exchange services in India with a wide spectrum of related products including sales of all major currencies, travelers’ checks, demand drafts, remittances, money transfers and prepaid cards primarily for corporate clients. The earn-out period expired on December 31, 2019 and the acquired business did not meet the requisite revenue target, so no earnout payment was due or paid.
Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired an 80% controlling stake in India based Zillious for $10.1 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $2.2 million based on agreed milestones in the acquisition agreement. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India. The Company determined that the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was zero as of September 30, 2020 and at December 31, 2020.
A significant component of the purchase price consideration for many of the Company's business acquisitions is a potential subsequent cash earn-out payment based on reaching certain specified future revenue targets. The terms for the contingent earn-out payments in most of the Company's business acquisitions typically address the GAAP recognizable revenues achieved by the acquired entity over a one-, two-, and/or three-year period subsequent to the effective date of their acquisition by Ebix. These terms typically establish a minimum threshold revenue target to achieve over the agreed upon period post acquisition to earn the specified cash earn-out payment. The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes these potential obligations as contingent liabilities and are reported as such on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed in more detail in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, these contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, the total of these contingent liabilities was $0.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the total of these contingent liabilities was $10.1 million, of which $1.5 million was reported in long-term liabilities, and $8.6 million was included in current liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Operating Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated $100.4 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $39.6 million, or 65%. The major sources of cash provided by our operating activities during 2020 included net income of $92.4 million, adjusted for $3.6 million of net loss attributable to non-controlling interest, $13.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $6.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $6.2 million related to a non-cash intangible impairment loss, $4.8 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $3.4 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, $(19.9) million of working capital requirements, $(6.5) million of cash used to pay the Miles acquisition earn out, and $(3.1) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities. The increase in our operating cash flow in
2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily due to increased cash flow from reductions in accounts receivable from trade and service providers as COVID-19 reduced revenues and resulted in comparatively more accounts receivable conversion to cash in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, in 2019 the acquisition earn-out accrual was reduced by $16.5 million (primarily related to the ItzCash acquisition earn out accrual) as compared to a reduction of the same accrual in 2020 of $3.1 million (primarily related to the Miles and Zillious acquisitions), both of which served to reduce operating cash flow given the non-cash nature of the gains from earn-out adjustments.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company generated $60.8 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $26.5 million, or 30%. The major sources of cash provided by our operating activities during 2019 included net income of $96.7 million, less $6.1 million of net income attributable to a non-controlling interest, and net of $(16.5) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities, $(15.5) million of deferred tax benefits, $14.5 million of depreciation and amortization, $7.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $3.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $2.7 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, and $(26.5) million of working capital requirements. The primary cause for the decrease in our operating cash flow was the cash required to fund our substantially increased gross merchandise value ("GMV") transactions for our travel and foreign exchange business and the $19.7 million paid to settle the derivative litigation matter discussed in Item 3 "Legal Proceedings".
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $44.8 million, primarily related to a $21.0 million decrease in investment in marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposits), $14.3 million used for the acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million of capital expenditures to support our operations, and $4.2 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold/marketed or used internally.
Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, totaled $96.7 million and consisted of $105.5 million used for acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million to reacquire Paul Merchant's 10% equity interest in Ebix’s combined international remittance business in India, $4.9 million of capital expenditures mainly in India to support our growing operations, and $8.0 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold and marketed, or used internally. Partially offsetting these outflows was $27.0 million from the net maturities of marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposit).
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was $42.0 million, and primarily consisted of a $10.9 million decrease in the year-end balances in our working capital facilities in India, $20.7 million used to make scheduled payments against the Company’s outstanding Credit Facility term loan, and $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $905 thousand, and primarily consisted of $13.0 million used to reacquire 295 thousand shares of the Company's common stock, $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock, and $15.1 million used to make scheduled payments against the Credit Facility term loan. Partially offsetting this cash outflow was $13.5 million provided via borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, repayment of a $6.5 million short term loan that had been made to a third party, and $19.1 million net funds provided by the EbixCash working capital facilities in India.
Credit Facility
