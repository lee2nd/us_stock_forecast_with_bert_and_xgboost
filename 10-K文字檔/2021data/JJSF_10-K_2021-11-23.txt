Item 7. Management’s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management regarding our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company discloses its significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to its audited consolidated financial statements.
Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company’s accounting policies in certain areas. Following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates: revenue recognition, accounts receivable, cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived and intangible assets, estimates of the value and useful lives of intangible assets, insurance reserves, inventories, and income taxes.
There are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas. We base our critical assumptions on historical experience, third-party data, and various other estimates we believe to be reasonable. A description of the aforementioned policies follows:
Revenue Recognition - We adopted the new revenue recognition guidance on the first day of our fiscal 2019 year using a modified retrospective approach; however, we did not record a cumulative-effect adjustment from initially applying the standard as the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. We completed a review of customer contracts and evaluated the impact of the new standard on certain common practices currently employed by us. We also finalized our assessment of the impact on our accounting policies, processes, system requirements, internal controls and disclosures.
When Performance Obligations Are Satisfied
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue recognition. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
The singular performance obligation of our customer contracts for product and machine sales is determined by each individual purchase order and the respective products ordered, with revenue being recognized at a point-in-time when the obligation under the terms of the agreement is satisfied and product control is transferred to our customer. Specifically, control transfers to our customers when the product is delivered to, installed, or picked up by our customers based upon applicable shipping terms, as our customers can direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the product at this point in time. The performance obligations in our customer contracts for product are generally satisfied within 30 days.
The singular performance obligation of our customer contracts for time and material repair and maintenance equipment service is the performance of the repair and maintenance with revenue being recognized at a point-in-time when the repair and maintenance is completed.
The singular performance obligation of our customer repair and maintenance equipment service contracts is the performance of the repair and maintenance with revenue being recognized over the time the service is expected to be performed. Our customers are billed for service contracts in advance of performance and therefore we have contract liability on our balance sheet.
Significant Payment Terms
In general, within our customer contracts, the purchase order identifies the product, quantity, price, pick-up allowances, payment terms and final delivery terms. Although some payment terms may be more extended, presently the majority of our payment terms are 30 days. As a result, we have used the available practical expedient and, consequently, do not adjust our revenues for the effects of a significant financing component.
Shipping
All amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenues; therefore, we recognize revenue for shipping and handling fees at the time the products are shipped or when services are performed. The cost of shipping products to the customer is recognized at the time the products are shipped to the customer and our policy is to classify them as Distribution expenses.
Variable Consideration
In addition to fixed contract consideration, our contracts include some form of variable consideration, including sales discounts, trade promotions and certain other sales and consumer incentives, including rebates and coupon redemptions. In general, variable consideration is treated as a reduction in revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Depending on the specific type of variable consideration, we use the most likely amount method to determine the variable consideration. We believe there will be no significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any related uncertainties are resolved with our customers. We review and update our estimates and related accruals of variable consideration each period based on historical experience.
Warranties & Returns
We provide all customers with a standard or assurance type warranty. Either stated or implied, we provide assurance the related products will comply with all agreed-upon specifications and other warranties provided under the law. No services beyond an assurance warranty are provided to our customers.
We do not grant a general right of return. However, customers may return defective or non-conforming products. Customer remedies may include either a cash refund or an exchange of the product. We do not estimate a right of return and related refund liability as returns of our products are rare.
Contract Balances
Our customers are billed for service contracts in advance of performance and therefore we have contract liability on our balance sheet as follows:
Disaggregation of Revenue
See Note N of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for disaggregation of our net sales by class of similar product and type of customer.
Allowance for Doubtful Receivables
We provide an allowance for doubtful receivables after taking into consideration historical experience and other factors. On September 27, 2020, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB in ASU 2016-13 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires companies to recognize an allowance that reflects a current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the asset. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors including the age of receivable balances, the history of losses, expectations of future credit losses and the customers’ ability to pay off obligations. The allowance for doubtful receivables was $1,405,000 and $1,388,000 on September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively.
Accounts Receivable - We record accounts receivable at the time revenue is recognized. Bad debt expense is recorded in marketing and administrative expenses. We continually monitor our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust it monthly. We have approximately 28 customers with accounts receivable balances of between $1 million to $10 million with one customer having a balance of approximately $14 million. Failure of these customers, and others with lesser balances, to pay us the amounts owed, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Accounts receivable due from any of our customers is subject to risk. Our total bad debt expense was $338,000, $1,105,000 and $389,000 for the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, our accounts receivables were $162,939,000 and $126,587,000 net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,405,000 and $1,388,000.
Asset Impairment - We have three reporting units with goodwill totaling $121,833,000 as of September 25, 2021. Goodwill is evaluated annually by the Company for impairment. We perform impairment tests at year end for our reporting units, which is also the operating segment level, with recorded goodwill utilizing primarily the discounted cash flow method. This methodology used to estimate the fair value of the total Company and its reporting units requires inputs and assumptions (i.e. revenue growth, operating profit margins, capital spending requirements and discount rates) that reflect current market conditions. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired, and the Company then determines the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine if impairment exists. Our tests at September 25, 2021 show that the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, no further analysis was required. The inputs and assumptions used involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual performance of the reporting units could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, economic conditions, competition, and consumer preferences.
Licenses and rights, customer relationships and non-compete agreements are being amortized by the straight-line method over periods ranging from 2 to 20 years and amortization expense is reflected throughout operating expenses. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and amortizing intangibles, are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed annually for impairment. Cash flow and sales analyses are used to assess impairment. The estimates of future cash flows and sales involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows and sales could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, economic conditions, competition, and consumer preferences.
Useful Lives of Intangible Assets - Most of our trade names and distribution rights which have carrying value have been assigned an indefinite life and are not amortized because we plan to receive the benefit from them indefinitely. If we decide to curtail or eliminate the use of any of the trade names or if sales that are generated from any particular trade name or distribution right do not support the carrying value of the trade name or distribution right, then we would record impairment or assign an estimated useful life and amortize over the remaining useful life. Rights such as prepaid licenses and non-compete agreements are amortized over contractual periods. The useful lives of customer relationships are based on the discounted cash flows expected to be received from sales to the customers adjusted for an attrition rate. The loss of a major customer or declining sales in general could create an impairment charge.
Insurance Reserves - We have a self-insured medical plan which covers approximately 1,600 of our employees. We record a liability for incurred but not yet reported or paid claims based on our historical experience of claims payments and a calculated lag time period. We maintain a spreadsheet that includes claims payments made each month according to the date the claim was incurred. This enables us to have an historical record of claims incurred but not yet paid at any point in the past. We then compare our accrued liability to the more recent claims incurred but not yet paid amounts and adjust our recorded liability up or down accordingly. Our recorded liability at September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was $1,791,000 and $1,737,000 respectively. Considering that we have stop loss coverage of $200,000 for each individual plan subscriber, the general consistency of claims payments and the short time lag, we believe that there is not a material exposure for this liability.
We self-insure, up to loss limits, workers’ compensation, automobile and general liability claims. Accruals for claims under our self-insurance program are recorded on a claims-incurred basis. Under this program, the estimated liability for claims incurred but unpaid in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $5,300,000 and $3,700,000, respectively. Our total recorded liability for all years’ claims incurred but not yet paid was $14,500,000 and $12,800,000 at September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. We estimate the liability based on total incurred claims and paid claims adjusting for loss development factors which account for the development of open claims over time. We estimate the amounts we expect to pay for some insurance years by multiplying incurred losses by a loss development factor which is based on insurance industry averages and the age of the incurred claims; our estimated liability is then the difference between the amounts we expect to pay and the amounts we have already paid for those years. Loss development factors that we use range from 1.0 to 2.0. However, for some years, the estimated liability is the difference between the amounts we have already paid for that year and the maximum we could pay under the program in effect for that particular year because the calculated amount we expect to pay is higher than the maximum. For other years, where there are few claims open, the estimated liability we record is the amount the insurance company has reserved for those claims. We evaluate our estimated liability on a continuing basis and adjust it accordingly. Due to the multi-year length of these insurance programs, there is exposure to claims coming in lower or higher than anticipated; however, due to constant monitoring and stop loss coverage of $350,000 on individual claims, we believe our exposure is not material. Because of the foregoing, we do not engage a third party actuary to assist in this analysis. In connection with these self-insurance agreements, we customarily enter into letters of credit arrangements with our insurers. At both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $9,275,000.
Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method) or market. We recognize abnormal amounts of idle facilities, freight, handling costs, and spoilage as charges of the current period. Additionally, we allocate fixed production overhead to inventories based on the normal capacity of our production facilities. We calculate normal capacity as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. This requires us to use judgment to determine when production is outside the range of expected variation in production (either abnormally low or abnormally high). In periods of abnormally low production (for example, periods in which there is significantly lower demand, labor and material shortages exist, or there is unplanned equipment downtime) the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased. However, in periods of abnormally high production the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is decreased to assure inventories are not measured above cost.
Income Taxes - We account for our income taxes under the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note A to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
Fiscal Year 2021 (52 weeks) Compared to Fiscal Year 2020 (52 weeks)
Net sales increased $122,541,000, or 12%, to $1,144,579,000 in fiscal 2021 from $1,022,038,000 in fiscal 2020. As parts of the economy that impact our operations continue to open, sales for the year improved from a year ago. Approximately 2/3 of the Company’s sales are to venues and locations that previously shut down or sharply curtailed their foodservice operations as a result of COVID-19. While the majority of these venues have re-opened, the extent of the future impact of COVID-19 on our operations depends on future developments of the virus and its effects which are uncertain at this point in time. As we have $305 million of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, we do not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor do we anticipate a material amount of our assets would be impaired.
We have three reportable segments, as disclosed in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements: Food Service, Retail Supermarkets and Frozen Beverages.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker for Food Service, Retail Supermarkets and Frozen Beverages reviews monthly detailed operating income statements and sales reports in order to assess performance and allocate resources to each individual segment. Sales and operating income are the key variables monitored by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and management when determining each segment’s and the Company’s financial condition and operating performance. In addition, the Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews and evaluates depreciation, capital spending and assets of each segment on a quarterly basis to monitor cash flow and asset needs of each segment.
FOOD SERVICE
Sales to food service customers increased $106,090,000, or 17%, to $724,983,000 in fiscal 2021. Soft pretzel sales to the food service market increased 16% to $174,977,000 for the year. Frozen novelties sales increased $9,429,000, or 27%, to $44,605,000 for the year. Churro sales to food service customers were up 38% to $64,916,000 for the year. Sales of bakery products increased $10,095,000, or 3%, to $342,609,000 for the year. Handheld sales to food service customers were up 110% to $75,627,000 in 2021. Sales of funnel cake increased $4,868,000, or 29% to $21,491,000. Sales were up across all product lines as many of the venues and locations where our products are sold that were previously shut down or operating at reduced capacity in 2020 have partially or fully re-opened in 2021.
Sales of new products in the first twelve months since their introduction were approximately $39 million for the year. Operating income in our Food Service segment increased from $6,458,000 in 2020 to $39,172,000 in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in sales which improved margin efficiencies and expense leverage.
RETAIL SUPERMARKETS
Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $7,732,000 or 4% to $184,897,000 in fiscal year 2021. Soft pretzel sales to retail supermarkets were $54,990,000, an increase of $5,833,000, or 12%, from sales in 2020. Sales of frozen novelties increased $11,316,000 or 13% to $100,059,000. Sales of biscuits and dumplings decreased 15% to $24,197,000 for the year. Handheld sales to retail supermarket customers decreased 38% to $7,547,000 for the year.
Sales of new products in the first twelve months since their introduction were approximately $1 million in fiscal year 2021. Operating income in our Retail Supermarkets segment increased from $23,202,000 to $25,914,000 for the year primarily due to higher volume.
FROZEN BEVERAGES
Total frozen beverage segment sales increased 4% to $234,699,000 in fiscal 2021 and beverage sales increased 16% or $17,494,000 for the year. Gallon sales increased 16% from last year. Service revenue decreased 3% to $81,305,000 for the year primarily due to the loss of a major customer in October 2020. Machines revenue, primarily sales of machines, decreased from $33,986,000 in 2020 to $26,953,000 in 2021 due to lower sales volumes with a major customer. Overall, sales in the frozen beverage segment grew as key amusement, convenience, restaurants, and retail venues returned to pre-COVID capacity in the second half of the year, which offset a slower recovery in the theater channel.
The estimated number of Company-owned frozen beverage dispensers was 19,000 and 27,000 at September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. Our Frozen Beverage segment had operating income of $6,132,000 in 2021 compared to an operating loss of $12,466,000 in 2020 primarily as a result of higher beverage sales volume due to COVID-19 recovery during 2021.
CONSOLIDATED
Other than as commented upon above by segment, there are no material specific reasons for the reported sales increases or decreases. Sales levels can be impacted by the appeal of our products to our customers and consumers and their changing tastes, competitive and pricing pressures, sales execution, marketing programs, seasonal weather, customer stability and general economic conditions.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 26.1% in 2021 from 23.3% in 2020. The increase is largely attributable to the benefit of increased sales, favorable product mix and corresponding margin efficiencies.
Total operating expenses increased $6,477,000 to $227,710,000 in fiscal 2021 but as a percentage of sales decreased to 19.9% of sales from 21.6% in 2020. Operating expenses this year included $1,273,000 of intangible asset impairment charges and operating expenses in 2020 included $6,387,000 of plant shutdown impairment costs for the shutdown of one of our manufacturing plants. Marketing and selling expenses decreased to 6.8% this year from 8.3% of sales in 2020 driven by effective investment of marketing dollars aligned with sales recovery. Distribution expenses as a percent of sales increased to 9.5% from 9.1% in 2020 due to rising freight and fuel costs. Administrative expenses were 3.5% and 3.6% of sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Operating income increased $54,024,000 or 314% to $71,218,000 in fiscal year 2021 as a result of the aforementioned items.
Our investments generated before tax income of $2,815,000 million this year, down from $4,356,000 last year due to decreases in the amount of investments and lower interest rates.
Our effective tax rate in our fiscal 2021 year was 24.9%. Net earnings for the 2020 year benefited from a reduction in income tax expense related to state deferred taxes of approximately $2.2 million. Excluding this adjustment, our effective tax rate in our fiscal 2020 year was 25.0%.
Net earnings increased $37,302,000 or 204%, in fiscal 2021 to $55,607,000, or $2.91 per diluted share, from $18,305,000 or $0.96 per diluted share, in fiscal 2020 as a result of the aforementioned items.
There are many factors which can impact our net earnings from year to year and in the long run, among which are the supply and cost of raw materials and labor, insurance costs, factors impacting sales as noted above, the continuing consolidation of our customers, our ability to manage our manufacturing, marketing and distribution activities, our ability to make and integrate acquisitions and changes in tax laws and interest rates.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
Fiscal Year 2020 (52 weeks) Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 (52 weeks)
Net sales decreased $164,449,000, or 14%, to $1,022,038,000 in fiscal 2020 from $1,186,487,000 in fiscal 2019. Excluding sales from the acquisition of ICEE Distributors in October 2019 and BAMA ICEE in February 2020, sales decreased 15% for the year. Sales for our fourth quarter improved to being down approximately 19% from a year ago compared to being down 34% from a year ago in our third quarter as parts of the economy that impact our operations continue to open up. Approximately 2/3 of the Company’s sales are to venues and locations that have shut down or sharply curtailed their foodservice operations, and therefore we anticipate COVID-19 will continue to have a negative impact on our business. As we have $278 million of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, up from $267 million at March 28, 2020, we do not expect to have any liquidity issues, nor do we anticipate a material amount of our assets would be impaired.
FOOD SERVICE
Sales to food service customers decreased $117,094,000, or 16%, to $618,893,000 in fiscal 2020. Soft pretzel sales to the food service market decreased 28% to $150,786,000 for the year. Frozen novelties sales decreased $8,496,000, or 19%, to $35,176,000 for the year. Churro sales to food service customers were down 29% to $46,881,000 for the year. Sales of bakery products decreased $26,506,000, or 7%, to $332,514,000 for the year. Handheld sales to food service customers were up 14% to $36,088,000 in 2020 with sales of a new product to a warehouse club store customer accounting for all of the increase. Sales of funnel cake decreased $8,170,000, or 33% to $16,623,000. Sales were down across all product lines except handhelds as many of the venues and locations where our products are sold had been shut down or operated at reduced capacity for some or all of the third and fourth quarters due to COVID-19.
Sales of new products in the first twelve months since their introduction were approximately $5 million for the year. Operating income in our Food Service segment decreased from $76,546,000 in 2019 to $6,458,000 in 2020 primarily because of lower production and sales volume due to COVID-19. This year’s operating income was impacted by plant shutdown impairment costs of $6,387,000 for the shutdown of one of our manufacturing plants. We expect to reduce manufacturing overhead and distribution costs by about $7-8 million annually as a result of this plant closure. This year also included approximately $6 million of costs for employee safety and increased COVID-19 compensation as well as increased expense of about $3.5 million for accounts receivable allowances and inventory losses due to the impact of COVID-19 on some of our customers and on sales of some of our products.
RETAIL SUPERMARKETS
Sales of products to retail supermarkets increased $32,573,000 or 23% to $177,165,000 in fiscal year 2020. Soft pretzel sales to retail supermarkets were $49,157,000, an increase of $12,893,000, or 36%, from sales in 2019. Sales of frozen novelties increased $14,992,000 or 20% to $88,743,000. Sales of biscuits and dumplings increased 12% to $28,317,000 for the year. Coupon redemption costs, a reduction of sales, of $3,569,000 were down less than 1% from 2019. Handheld sales to retail supermarket customers increased 13% to $12,303,000 for the year. Sales were generally higher for all product lines as sales in the year ago periods were impacted by lost volume and placements due to the price increases implemented in last year’s first quarter and because of increased sales to supermarkets generally since mid-March 2020 due to COVID-19.
Sales of new products in the first twelve months since their introduction were approximately $1 million in fiscal year 2020. Operating income in our Retail Supermarkets segment increased from $10,460,000 to $23,202,000 for the year primarily due to higher volume.
FROZEN BEVERAGES
Total frozen beverage segment sales decreased 26% to $225,980,000 in fiscal 2020 and beverage sales decreased 38% or $64,816,000 for the year. Excluding sales from the acquisition of ICEE Distributors in October 2019 and BAMA ICEE in February 2020, total frozen beverage segment sales decreased 30% for the year and beverage sales decreased 45% for the year. Gallon sales were down 41% from last year exclusive of ICEE Distributors’ gallons. Service revenue decreased 3% to $83,420,000 for the year with sales increases and decreases spread throughout our customer base with additional sales to existing customers and to new customers to largely offset declines in sales business to customers due to COVID-19. Machines revenue, primarily sales of machines, decreased from $45,811,000 in 2019 to $33,986,000 in 2020 with the decrease due to two significant install projects during the prior fiscal year, as well as the slowdown due to COVID-19. Sales are down across all product lines as many of the venues and locations where our products are sold have been shut down or operating at reduced capacity for some or all of the third and fourth quarters due to COVID-19.
The estimated number of Company-owned frozen beverage dispensers was 27,000 and 26,000 at September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. Our Frozen Beverage segment had an operating loss of $12,466,000 in 2020 compared to operating income of $29,950,000 in 2019 primarily as a result of lower sales volume due to COVID-19. This year’s operating income was also impacted by relocation costs of our ICEE’s headquarters of $2.5 million.
CONSOLIDATED
Other than as commented upon above by segment, there are no material specific reasons for the reported sales increases or decreases. Sales levels can be impacted by the appeal of our products to our customers and consumers and their changing tastes, competitive and pricing pressures, sales execution, marketing programs, seasonal weather, customer stability and general economic conditions.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 23.3% in 2020 from 29.5% in 2019. Gross profit percentage decreased because of lower volume in our food service and frozen beverages segments, higher costs related to production disruptions due to volume mix changes, expenses related to employee safety and increased COVID-19 compensation and increased cost compared to last year of about $4.5 million for the write-down and disposal of inventory.
Total operating expenses decreased $12,212,000 to $221,233,000 in fiscal 2020 but as a percentage of sales increased to 21.6% of sales from 19.7% in 2019. Operating expenses this year included $6,387,000 of plant shutdown impairment costs for the shutdown of one of our manufacturing plants. Marketing and selling expenses increased to 8.3% this year from 8.1% of sales in 2019. Distribution expenses as a percent of sales increased to 9.1% from 8.0% in 2019. Administrative expenses were 3.6% and 3.4% of sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The percentage increases mentioned above were because of the drop in sales (lower denominators) and our inability to reduce expenses in line with the decrease in sales because of fixed costs that do not fluctuate with sales.
Operating income decreased $99,762,000 or 85% to $17,194,000 in fiscal year 2020 as a result of the aforementioned items.
Our investments generated before tax income of $4,356,000 million this year, down from $7,741,000 last year due to decreases in the amount of investments and lower interest rates.
Other income in 2019 includes a $2.0 million payment received from a customer due to cancellation of production under a co-manufacturing agreement.
Net earnings in 2019 benefited from a reduction of approximately $900,000 in tax as the provision for the one-time repatriation tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recorded in 2018 was reduced as the amount recorded in 2018 was an estimate. Excluding the reduction in the provision for the one-time repatriation tax, our effective tax rate was 25.8% for 2019. Net earnings for the 2020 year benefited from a reduction in income tax expense related to state taxes of approximately $2.2 million. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate in our fiscal 2020 year was 25.0%.
Net earnings decreased $76,514,000 or 81%, in fiscal 2020 to $18,305,000, or $.96 per diluted share, from $94,819,000 or $5.00 per diluted share, in fiscal 2019 as a result of the aforementioned items.
There are many factors which can impact our net earnings from year to year and in the long run, among which are the supply and cost of raw materials and labor, insurance costs, factors impacting sales as noted above, the continuing consolidation of our customers, our ability to manage our manufacturing, marketing and distribution activities, our ability to make and integrate acquisitions and changes in tax laws and interest rates.

These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and their operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Although there are many factors that could impact our operating cash flow, most notably net earnings, we believe that our future operating cash flow, along with our borrowing capacity, our current cash and cash equivalent balances and our investment securities is sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next twelve months and beyond, as well as fund future growth and expansion.
As of September 25, 2021, we have 283,192,000 of Cash and Cash Equivalents, and $22,111,000 of Marketable Securities.
The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:
Purchase Commitments
Our most significant raw material requirements include flour, packaging, shortening, corn syrup, sugar, juice, cheese, chocolate, and a variety of nuts. We attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 1 to 12 months. As of September 25, 2021, we have approximately $78 million of such commitments. The purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business.
Leases
We have operating leases with initial noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year covering the rental of various facilities and equipment. Our operating leases include leases for real estate from some of our office and manufacturing facilities as well as manufacturing and non-manufacturing equipment used in our business. As of September 25, 2021, we have operating lease payment obligations of $66,324,000, with $14,994,000 payable within 12 months.
Fluctuations in the value of the Mexican and Canadian currencies and the resulting translation of the net assets of our Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries caused a decrease of $2,204,000 in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2021, an increase of $2,599,000 in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2020 and an increase of $909,000 in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2019. In 2021, sales of the two subsidiaries were $20,754,000 as compared to $15,421,000 in 2020 and $33,906,000 in 2019. The fluctuation of sales over the periods presented is the result of COVID-19.
In our fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock.
In our fiscal year ended September 26, 2020, we purchased and retired 65,648 shares of our common stock at a cost of $8,972,292.
In our fiscal year ended September 25, 2021, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock.
In November 2016, we entered into an amendment and modification to an amended and restated loan agreement with our existing banks which provides for up to a $50,000,000 revolving credit facility repayable in November 2021. The agreement contains restrictive covenants and requires commitment fees in accordance with standard banking practice. There were no outstanding balances under the facility at September 25, 2021 or at September 26, 2020. The significant financial covenants are:
. Tangible net worth must initially be more than $465 million.
. Total funded indebtedness divided by earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization shall not be greater than 2.25 to 1.
We were in compliance with the financial covenants described above at September 25, 2021.
On November 16, 2021, we entered into an amendment and modification to the amended and restated loan agreement which extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility to December 16, 2021.
We self-insure, up to loss limits, certain insurable risks such as workers’ compensation, automobile, and general liability claims. Accruals for claims under our self-insurance program are recorded on a claims-incurred basis. Under this program, the estimated liability for claims incurred but unpaid in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $5,300,000 and $3,700,000, respectively. In connection with certain self-insurance agreements, we customarily enter into letters of credit arrangements with our insurers. At both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $9,275,000.
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held to maturity and available for sale increased $27,440,000 or 10%, to $305,303,000 from a year ago for reasons described below.
Accounts receivables, net increased $36,352,000, or 29%, to $162,939,000 in 2021 because of higher sales in this year’s September month and timing of collections.
Inventory increased $14,237,000 or 13% to $123,160,000 largely due to the increase in sales and the need for additional inventory in connection with the increased sales.
Prepaid expenses and other was $7,498,000 compared to $17,087,000 last year, as prepaid income tax decreased by $13,697,000. Prepaid taxes in 2020 were higher, as payments in the first six months of the year were based on pre-COVID expectations.
Net property, plant and equipment increased $5,571,000 to $267,187,000 because purchases of property, plant and equipment for the improvement and expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and frozen carbonated beverage business exceeded depreciation on existing assets. Purchases of property, plant and equipment decreased slightly to $53,578,000 in 2021 from $57,817,000 in 2020. We are continually looking for opportunities to invest in projects at our manufacturing facilities that have a financial payback on capital invested with the goal of improving efficiency and reducing operating costs.
Marketable securities available for sale and held to maturity decreased by $59,943,000 to $22,111,000 as we decreased our holdings of corporate bonds and available for sale securities primarily due to the decline in interest rates.
Accounts Payables increased 32% to $96,789,000 from $73,135,000 in 2020.
Dividends payable increased to $12,080,000 as our quarterly dividend payment increased to $0.633/share from $0.575/share.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $9,356,000 to $101,499,000 in 2021 primarily because of an increase in net earnings offset by an increase in the investment in net working capital balances, predominantly related to accounts receivable.
Net cash provided by investing activities increased $54,402,000 to $9,939,000 in 2021 from net cash used in investing activities of $44,463,000 in 2020 primarily due to $57,212,000 of cash paid for purchases of companies in 2020. In 2021, proceeds from the redemption and sales of marketable securities outpaced the cash used on purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $18,791,000 to a use of cash of $24,673,000 in 2021 due to an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock combined with having no repurchases of common stock in 2021. The net use of cash in 2021 was due the payment of cash dividends outpacing the inflow of cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
In 2021, the major variables in determining our net increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were our increase in net earnings, depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and changes in deferred tax liabilities, purchases of property, plant and equipment, and payments of cash dividends. Other variables which in the past have had a significant impact on our change in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are proceeds from borrowings and payments of long-term debt. As discussed in results of operations, our net earnings may be influenced by many factors. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets is primarily determined by past purchases of property, plant and equipment although it could be impacted by a significant acquisition. Purchases of property, plant and equipment are primarily determined by our ongoing normal manufacturing and marketing requirements but could be increased significantly for manufacturing expansion requirements or large frozen beverage customer needs. We are actively seeking acquisitions that could be a significant use of cash. Although we have no long-term debt at September 25, 2021, we may borrow in the future depending on our needs.
