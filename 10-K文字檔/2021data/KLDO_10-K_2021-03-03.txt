Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage healthcare company with a differentiated, chemistry-driven approach focused on leveraging the microbiome to treat disease and improve human health. We have built a human-centric proprietary product platform for discovery and development that we believe will enable the rapid advancement of a broad portfolio of novel product candidates using either human clinical studies under regulations supporting research with food or clinical trials as drug candidates. Our product candidates are Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (“MMT” or “MMTs”) which are designed to modulate the metabolic output and profile of the microbiome by driving the function and composition of existing microbes. We have an industrialized approach to the discovery and development of MMTs, and our initial MMTs are targeted glycans. Each targeted glycan is an ensemble of complex carbohydrates that is intended to modulate microbial metabolism and community composition to drive a specific biological response. We believe our MMTs have the potential to be novel treatments across a variety of diseases and conditions.
The human microbiome is generally a community of more than 30 trillion microbes, organisms that include bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi, which reside on and inside the human body. By evolving together over thousands of years, microbes and humans have developed an intricate and mutually beneficial relationship. Given the profound impact that microbes have on human health, this highly complex microbial ecosystem has been referred to as a “newly discovered organ.” There is a growing body of research that links a healthy microbiome with overall human health, while dysbiosis, or imbalance, in the microbiome has been correlated with numerous human conditions including those that cause significant morbidity and mortality. Some of these conditions include irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cancer, allergies and ulcerative colitis. The gut microbiome remains a largely untapped frontier in healthcare, and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to succeed in translating its promise into solutions for human health.
Our product candidates include multiple clinical programs that have advanced into human studies (COVID-19, ulcerative colitis, urea cycle disorder, and hepatic encephalopathy) as well as earlier programs (immuno-oncology and cardiometabolic and liver diseases) aimed at expanding our MMT platform and clinical pipeline in 2021 and beyond.
COVID-19 and Effects of KB109 in addition to Supportive Self Care (SSC)
KB109 was selected for evaluation in these COVID-19 clinical studies based on its demonstrated ability to increase production of SCFAs as well as to promote commensal bacteria and reduce pathogenic bacteria ex vivo.
Patients in a non-IND clinical study were randomized within 48 hours of testing positive for COVID-19 to either receive Supportive Self Care (SSC) or SSC plus Microbiome Metabolic Therapy (MMT) candidate KB109 for two weeks and then followed for an additional three weeks. The planned interim analysis comprised approximately half of the total study population (n=176) and showed that KB109 was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies of MMT candidates and no unexpected treatment-related adverse events.
Approximately 40 percent of the patients reported at least one comorbidity at baseline. The presence of comorbidity lengthened the time to resolution of symptoms in mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. In the SSC alone arm, median time to resolution of the thirteen overall COVID-19 related symptoms in patients with no comorbidities was 14 days as compared with 27 days in patients with at least one comorbidity. While no difference in median time to
resolution of symptoms was observed with KB109 plus SSC for the overall population, small differences between the arms were observed during the follow-up period. For patients reporting one or more comorbidities, the median time to resolution of the thirteen overall COVID-19 related symptoms was 18 days with KB109 plus SSC and 27 days with SSC alone.
We also evaluated eight cardinal COVID-19 related symptoms as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which showed median time to resolution of symptoms among patients with one or more comorbidity at baseline was 15 days for the KB109 plus SSC group as compared with 27 days with SSC alone. The K031 study of 350 subjects is fully enrolled with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. Topline data from a smaller 50 subject study of KB109 is also expected in the first quarter of 2021.
Ulcerative Colitis and KB295
Evidence suggests that a feature of ulcerative colitis (UC) is alteration of the gut microbiome, including an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria and decrease in commensal diversity which interfere with the normal immune response. In ex vivo studies, KB295 has demonstrated the ability to increase the production of short chain fatty acids and suppress the growth of inflammatory bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae.
We are conducting a clinical study evaluating MMT candidate KB295 in patients with mild-to-moderate UC. This non-IND open label, single arm clinical study is expected to enroll approximately 30 patients with mild-to-moderate UC. Patients will receive KB295 for eight weeks titrated up to 40g twice daily and then enter a one-month follow-up period. The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB295 and other assessments including the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index composite score, changes in microbiome composition and biomarkers of inflammation. Top line data for the study are expected in mid-2021.
Urea Cycle Disorder and KB195
KB195 is our lead MMT candidate for development in the treatment of patients with urea cycle disorder (UCD). We selected KB195 after assessing its performance in reducing ammonia relative to a wide range of other MMTs, as well as several controls, in ex vivo screening of microbiome samples from healthy volunteers, as well as microbiome samples from patients with UCD.
The goal of the UCD program is to develop a potential treatment for UCD that significantly improves the clinical outcomes by reducing serum ammonia levels; thereby reducing the risk of life-threatening hyperammonemic crises. The objective of the program is to stabilize a greater percentage of UCD patients that are on currently available therapies, and, if data support, move to a first-line nitrogen-binding therapy sparing regimen.
We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial under an IND and approved CTAs in a number of countries. As clinical sites around the world have dealt with repeated closures due to COVID-19, enrollment for this study has been impacted. We continue to monitor enrollment but are not currently able to estimate when data will be available.
Hepatic Encephalopathy and KB174
We selected KB174 as a candidate for the potential treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). KB174 was selected based on its ability to reduce ammonia and pathogens ex vivo as well as results from a clinical study of KB174 in patients with well-compensated liver cirrhosis. Forty adult patients with liver disease were enrolled in this double-blind, controlled non-IND/non-CTA clinical study. Patients were randomized to receive KB174 or maltodextrin (a negative control), orally (titrated to 36g BID) for 28 days. Safety and tolerability were assessed using the GITQ and BSS and microbiome ammonia production was measured using the 15 N lacto-ureide as a stable isotope tracer.
In this study, patients with well-compensated cirrhosis treated with KB174 had a 26% median reduction from baseline in urinary 15N excretion, a biomarker of microbiome ammonia production, compared to a 3% median reduction from baseline in urinary 15N excretion for patients receiving maltodextrin. KB174 was well tolerated and no clinically significant or serious treatment-related adverse events were observed.
Results from a dosing study with KB174 in healthy subjects showed reductions in urinary 15N excretion consistent with the study in patients with cirrhosis and was well tolerated with no clinically significant or serious treatment-related adverse events.
The focus of the HE program will be to develop a novel therapy that addresses patients at risk for HE, including those with MHE as well as OHE. Initiation of the next clinical study or clinical trial in HE is dependent on identifying a suitable partner for this program.
Future pipeline opportunities
We are currently pursuing a number of opportunities beyond our initial pipeline. Our proprietary product platform is designed to generate the knowledge and insights required to support discovery and development work in a wide range of areas, including where evidence of a link to the microbiome exists but the biology is not yet fully defined. We believe that these areas of more complex microbiome-human biology present an opportunity to leverage our human-centric discovery and development approach and computational expertise.
We have active programs in discovery, including work in immuno-oncology and cardiometabolic and liver diseases. Correlative data has been published for each of these areas suggesting that the microbiome plays a critical role, and our discovery efforts are largely focused on either establishing a mechanistic hypothesis or establishing and optimizing an ex vivo screen to address these opportunities. Some of this work is being conducted through collaborations, including with Institute Gustave Roussy in Paris exploring the potential of MMTs to improve the outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitor (“ICI”) treatment, with Jeffrey Gordon at Washington University (St. Louis) studying the mechanisms by which selected MMT candidates are metabolized by the gut microbiome and the impact on key functions in the host, and with Janssen focusing on decreasing the risk of the development of child-onset atopic diseases, including food allergies. We will advance MMT candidates once identified for future pipeline opportunities.
Since our inception in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to building our proprietary product platform, developing our pipeline of MMT candidates, building our intellectual property portfolio and process development and manufacturing function, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through public offering of our equity securities, private placement of our convertible preferred stock and borrowings of long-term debt.
We have incurred significant net losses since inception and expect to continue to incur net operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
•
conduct preclinical studies, clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
advance the development of our product candidate pipeline;
•
continue to discover and develop additional product candidates;
•
continue to build out our proprietary product platform and to increase its throughput for the discovery and nomination of product candidates;
•
develop, acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional clinical, scientific and commercial personnel;
•
expand manufacturing capabilities, including in-house and third-party commercial manufacturing, through the purchase, renovation, customization and operation of a manufacturing facility and securing supply chain capacity sufficient to provide clinical study and clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of any product candidates which we may commercialize;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates for therapeutic indications that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval or identify alternate commercial pathways for such products; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our transition to a public reporting company.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for or identify alternate non-drug pathways for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for or otherwise commercialize any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $46.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of $274.2 million. Based on our current operating plans and net proceeds from the 2021 Offering, we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into the first quarter of 2022. We will require substantial additional capital to sustain our operations and pursue our growth strategy, including the development of our MMT candidates. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through equity or debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For more information, refer to “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
Financial Overview
Revenue
We have recently begun to generate collaboration revenue but have not generated and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts for our current product candidates or additional product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and can be commercialized, or if we enter into future collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.
The collaboration revenue recognized in 2020 relates to a research collaboration with Janssen’s World Without Disease Accelerator, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The collaboration explores the potential for Kaleido’s Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™) to prevent the onset of childhood allergy and other atopic, immune and metabolic conditions by driving specific microbiome features which support an appropriate maturation of the infant immune system. We do not expect the total revenue under this arrangement to be material in the aggregate.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses include:
•
development and operation of our proprietary product platform;
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs;
•
the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing products for use in our preclinical studies, clinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;
•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
Our direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs that include fees, reimbursed materials and other costs paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies and facilities expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and our platform technology and, as such, are not separately classified.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of programs we decide to pursue and their regulatory paths to market;
•
raising additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development of and commercialize our product candidates;
•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into and may enter into collaboration arrangements;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•
our ability to maintain existing and establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•
the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for any product candidates for therapeutic indications;
•
the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of our product candidates;
•
establishing agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our product candidates is approved or commercialized on an alternate regulatory pathway;
•
meeting demand in a timely fashion with sufficient supply at appropriate quality levels;
•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•
the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved if approval to market is required;
•
obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement;
•
the acceptance of our product candidates, if commercialized, by patients, consumers, the medical community and third-party payors;
•
competition with other products; and
•
a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following commercialization.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval or commercialization for any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased by $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in personnel-related costs of $6.8 million was due to decreased headcount in our research and development function. The decrease in external manufacturing and research of $10.3 million was primarily due to less costs incurred for our clinical studies with external CROs and external CMOs, less IND-enablement costs associated with our preclinical and clinical development activities, and a decrease in production of study material used in preclinical and human studies. The increase in professional and consulting fees of $3.8 million was primarily the result of increased spend relating to our studies. The increase in facility-related and other expenses of $3.8 million was primarily due to increased operating costs associated with the expansion of our facility that were attributed to the research and development function.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in personnel-related costs of $1.7 million was primarily due to reduced headcount in our general and administrative functions. The increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million was primarily due to the modification of the vesting provision of stock options and restricted stock units related to the resignation of our former CEO. The increase in facility-related and other expenses of $1.0 million was primarily due to increased operating costs associated with the expansion of our facility that were attributed to the general and administrative functions.
Interest Income
Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.2 million compared to $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased primarily as a result of lower average cash balance during 2020 and lower interest rates in 2020 due to market conditions. Interest income in future periods will fluctuate based upon the amount of invested cash available and interest rates.
Interest expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.8 million, compared to $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 interest expense is related to our credit agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through the public offering of our equity securities, private placement of our convertible preferred stock and borrowings of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, $22.5 million was outstanding under the debt facility and $12.5 million was available for borrowing contingent upon successful completion of financing and operational milestones. In March 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of $69.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering costs totaling $3.8 million. On June 4, 2020, the Company completed a public offering (the “Offering”), pursuant to which it issued and sold 4,750,000 shares of the common stock. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the Offering were $34.5 million, including 185,000 shares exercised on July 1, 2020 for the Underwriters’ option. On August 4, 2020, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with a sales agent for the sale of up to $50.0 million of the Company’s shares of common stock, from time to time in an at-the-market public offering (the “ATM”). The sales agent is entitled to compensation at a fixed commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold 361,299 shares of its common stock under the ATM which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $3.4 million after payment of related commissions. As of December 31, 2020, there was $46.5 million available under the ATM. In January and February 2021, the Company has sold 309,656 shares of its common stock under the ATM which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $4.9 million. On February 8, 2021, the Company completed a public offering (the “2021 Offering”) including the Underwriters’ overallotment option, pursuant to which it issued and sold 6,037,500 shares our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $65.3 million.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $46.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of $274.2 million. Based on our current operating plans and net proceeds from the 2021 Offering, we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into the first quarter of 2022. We will require substantial additional capital to sustain our operations and pursue our growth strategy, including the development of our MMT candidates. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For more information, refer to “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $61.5 million of cash, due to our net loss of $81.6 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $15.6 million and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.5 million. Net cash provided by our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $5.0 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $75.8 million of cash, due to our net loss of $86.3 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.2 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $11.8 million. Net cash used in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a $0.7 million decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities.
Changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities were generally due to the advancement of our research programs and the timing of vendor invoices and payments.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $4.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively, due to purchases of property and equipment.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $40.4 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the Offering in June 2020, proceeds from the sale of shares under the ATM in 2020, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $74.6 million, consisting of $66.0 million in aggregate net proceeds from our IPO in March 2019, $6.6 million in net proceeds from debt refinancings, and $0.3 million in the settlement of our derivative liability.
On December 31, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the “Lender”). Under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders extended an initial $22.5 million to us, with the option to draw down an additional $12.5 million if certain milestones and conditions are met. The Credit Agreement includes an end of term charge equal to 7.55% of the aggregate principal amount of all advances. The end of term charge is being accrued and recorded to interest expense over the life of the Credit Agreement using the effective interest method.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, covenants that limit or restrict the Borrower’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, pay dividends or other distributions or repurchase equity, make investments, dispose of assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. As security for its obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers granted the Lender a first priority security interest on substantially all of the Borrowers’ assets (other than intellectual property), subject to certain exceptions.
The facility carries a 48-month term with interest only payments on the outstanding principal for the first 18 months, which can be extended to up to 24 months, depending on the achievement of certain performance milestones. The Term Loan will mature in January 2024 and bears an interest rate of equal to the greater of (a) 9.35% and (b) 9.35% plus the Wall Street Journal prime rate minus 3.25%. The Credit Agreement is subject to mandatory prepayment provisions that require prepayment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control event (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
Funding Requirements
Over the next several quarters we are focusing our activities on key exploratory and clinical studies and clinical trials which we expect will reduce our overall expense rate. In the periods that follow, assuming the success of our clinical studies and clinical trials, we anticipate our expenses to increase as we progress towards larger and more pivotal clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, with the potential for larger clinical studies, clinical trials and associated manufacturing. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:
•
the commencement, enrollment or results of the planned clinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates or any future clinical studies or clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates;
•
the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;
•
changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;
•
developments concerning our CMOs;
•
our ability to obtain materials and to produce adequate cGMP compliant product supply for any approved or commercialized product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, if needed;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval or identify an alternate regulatory pathway to market;
•
the costs involved in prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;
•
additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;
•
unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; and
•
the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under applicable SEC rules.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued research and development expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;
•
CROs and investigative sites in connection with preclinical, human clinical studies and clinical trials; and
•
CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical, human clinical studies and clinical trial materials.
We measure the expense recognized based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies, human clinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of certain milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in changes in estimates that increase or decrease amounts recognized in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period.
