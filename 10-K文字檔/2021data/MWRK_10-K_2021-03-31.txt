ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative about our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report. This discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions about events and trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the sections of this annual report titled “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements”.
Overview
Our business is a services and development business that provides a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and payment technologies into their business operations. We anticipate that we will enable companies to focus on their core competencies while providing the necessary resources and expertise to execute a strategy that will enable companies to integrate new blockchain plus payment technologies into their business operations. Our plan is to be compensated on a fee-for-services model, technology licensing model and reoccurring transactions revenue model. We may accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
Results of Operations
Revenue
We recognized revenues of $190,333 from consulting services for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $250,000 in 2019.
Operating Expenses
We incurred operating expenses of $795,239 and $2,187,114 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,391,875 between the two periods. These expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, service costs, professional fees, stock-based compensation, interest and bank charges, and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in operating expenses between the two periods related to an decrease in consulting expenses from $656,737 in 2019 to $348,100 in 2020 due to our company amending consulting agreement with individuals to provide strategic and project management services, a decrease in professional fees from $206,250 in 2019 to $84,726 in 2020 due to less activity in 2020, and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses from $1,378,834 in 2019 to $328,750 in 2020 as the rental agreement was cancelled in Q1 2020 and travel costs and advertising expenses have decreased due to lowered activity in 2020.
Net Loss from Operations
We incurred net losses from operations of $604,906 and $1,937,114 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,332,208 primarily attributable to the factors discussed above under the heading “Operating Expenses”.

Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) includes $314,974 of principal and interest receivables collected for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a loan receivable to a related party compared to $56,096 for the period ended December 31, 2019. Other expenses include interest expense on convertible notes payable of $150,992 compared to $113,413 interest expense for the same period last year. There were warrants issued for the year ended December 31, 2020 with a derivative liability of $3,615,149 (2019 - nil). There was also bad debt expense of $110,000 and an impairment of $2,783,834 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The loan receivable of $1,250,000, plus accrued interest of $86,762, was impaired as the loan matured at the end of Q3 2019 and there were concerns about collectability. Efforts to pursue the receivable amounts will continue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
Current Assets
Current assets of $142,024 as at December 31, 2020 and $42,886 as at December 31, 2019 were comprised of only cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, an outstanding loan receivable, deferred service costs and our capitalized service costs. The increase in current assets as at December 31, 2020 is mainly due to revenues receivable of $90,333. Cash and cash equivalents also increased by $32,073 as it was used for operating costs in the year.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities as at December 31, 2020 were attributable to $144,461 in accounts payable, $135,965 in accounts payable, related party, $467,369 in loans payable and interest, related party and $1,050,765 in convertible notes and accrued interest due within the year compared to $227,707 in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $78,408 in accounts payable, related party, $534,840 in loans payable and accrued interest, related party, and $1,003,738 in convertible notes and accrued interest as at December 31, 2019.

Net cash used in operating activities was $337,855 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2,292,337 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,954,482.

Cash Requirements
We expect that we will require $1,200,000, including our current working capital, to fund our operating expenditures for the next twelve months. Projected working capital requirements for the next twelve months are as follows:
Estimated Working Capital Expenditures During the Next Twelve Months
Our estimated general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months are $1,200,000 and are comprised of: consulting fees, accounting services, board of directors and our advisory board, investor relations consultants, and to our public relations and marketing consultants; legal and professional fees (including auditing fees); for insurance; marketing and advertising expenses; trade shows; travel expenses; office rent and miscellaneous and office expenses.
We will require additional cash resources to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to derive such cash through the sale of equity or debt securities or by obtaining a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in debt service obligations, could cause additional dilution to our stockholders, and could require us to agree to financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to source a new business opportunity. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to raise additional funds could cause our company to fail.
Going Concern
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established a source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $13,323,375 as at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: $9,310,776). Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable.
In its report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
