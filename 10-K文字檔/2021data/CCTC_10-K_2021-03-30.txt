Overview
Over the past decade, Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. has developed processes that address what we believe are the key technology priorities of the global coal industry. We currently have three processes in our intellectual property portfolio:
The original process, called Pristine, is designed to remove moisture and volatile matter, rendering a high-efficiency, cleaner thermal coal. The process has been tested successfully on bituminous and subbituminous coals, and lignite from various parts of the United States and from numerous countries around the world.
Our second process, called Pristine-M, is a low-cost coal dehydration technology. In tests, this process has succeeded in drying coal economically and stabilizing it using volatile matter released by the feed coal. Construction of our coal testing plant was completed in December 2015 and was successfully tested through April 2016 at AES Coal Power Utility in Oklahoma. Additional tests commenced and were completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. This test facility has been moved from AES to Wyoming where reassembly has commenced and testing of international coal is expected upon completion of the reassembly. Changes identified to the process by the University of Wyoming and our EPC contractors will be included in the reassembly and it is expected to provide a higher quality end product with a lower capital cost for a commercial unit. The reassembly is expected to be completed no later than Q3 2021.
Our third process, called Pristine-SA, is designed to eliminate 100% of the volatile matter in the feed coal and to achieve stable combustion by co-firing it with biomass or natural gas. The process is expected to produce a cleaner fuel that eliminates the need for emissions scrubbers and the corollary production of toxic coal ash. We anticipate that treated coal that is co-fired with other energy resources will burn as clean as natural gas.
Anticipated Benefits of the Technology:
•
Reduction of undesired emissions and greenhouse gases through the removal of compounds that are not required for combustion in conventional boilers.
•
Cost savings and environmental impact reduction. Our pre-combustion solution is expected to be significantly less expensive than post-combustion solutions such as emissions scrubbers. Not only are the latter prohibitively expensive, they produce coal ash containing the “scrubbed” compounds, which is dumped in toxic waste disposal sites where it may pose continuing environmental risk. Coal treated using our processes may eliminate the need for post-combustion emissions scrubbers and the resulting toxic ash. By beneficiating the coal it requires less coal to be consumed to achieve the same energy output. This will save on transportation and handling costs.
•
Potential use of compounds removed from treated coal. Volatile matter captured in the Pristine process is removed in the form of hydrocarbon liquids that we believe will be easily blended with crude oil or used as feedstock for various products. For example, sulfur, which can be removed using the Pristine process, is a basic feedstock for fertilizer. The harvesting of hydrocarbon liquids from abundant, cheaper coal is a potentially lucrative side benefit of our processes. All coal by-products including Rare Earth Minerals extraction will be tested in the second-generation facility.
Successful testing of the Pristine M process resulted in an increase in BTU of the processed coal and a reduction in moisture content making it less expensive to transport (as moisture has been removed) with the end product being a dust free stabilized enhanced coal which we believe will address the issue of coal dust pollution during transportation.
•
Energy Independence. To the extent that volatile matter is removed from coal, coal’s use as an energy resource is greatly improved, enabling coal-rich countries to move towards energy independence owing to coal’s greater abundance. Extraction of by-products including Rare Earth Minerals is also expected to provide coal derivative product independence.
Development Status:
Pristine process. Pristine process successfully lab tested on small scale and through advanced computer modeling. As at March, 2021, various aspects of the Pristine process were successfully tested at our test facility at the AES coal Power plant in Oklahoma as part of the overall testing of Pristine M. The second-generation facility in Wyoming is expected to perform a more detailed testing of the Pristine process.
Pristine-M. Testing of the Pristine M process on Powder River Basin coal at the AES facility in Oklahoma was completed in December 2017. The Pristine M process was successfully tested and the process, engineering and science were independently proven. The test facility was moved from the AES location to Wyoming where reassembly commenced in Q4 2019 and testing of international coal is expected upon completion of reassembly. Unfortunately, the reassembly was delayed due to the pandemic. Despite the delay, the reassembly is expected to be completed no later than Q3, 2021. Over several months in 2018 and early 2019 the University of Wyoming independently validated the Pristine M process in their laboratory. In 2020, in conjunction with the University a Rotary Kiln was manufactured and delivered to our site in Wyoming. We await its integration into our test facility during re-assembly expected in Q3 2021.
Pristine-SA process. Pristine SA process analysis is at a very early stage. Further research and development is expected using the test facility at its permanent location in Wyoming.
Business Outlook
•
Wyoming New Power, a related party company, has agreed to sign a two million ton per annum license agreement to use Pristine M at a location in Wyoming. They have paid a non-refundable $100,000 deposit on the license agreement. The definitive license agreement is expected to be signed following the receipt of commercial design which will incorporate the suggested changes proposed by the University of Wyoming and our EPC contractor. Wyoming New Power is a Related Party because it is controlled by a party that also controls the entity, which is the major lender and significant stockholder of the Company.
•
Jindal Steel & Power is expected to send though their coal for sampling immediately following the plants re-assembly. The bespoke commercial facility design is expected after the testing.
In Q2, 2019 the Company signed a non binding MOU with Universitas Indonesia in a combined effort to assess the impact of our technology on Indonesian Coal both from a coal beneficiation perspective and also coal by-products.
The second-generation test facility will have the capability of producing Char. There is local Wyoming demand for this product that the company expects to sell.
•
The Company entered into a partnership with the University of Wyoming with the sole focus of using our suite of technologies to increase the use of and value of Wyoming Powder River Basin coal. Primary focus is on utilizing our technology to extract valuable derivative products from coal. Changes to the process have been identified by the University and the company EPC engineers and will be incorporated in the reassembly of the facility in Wyoming. The University confirmed in Q2, 2019 that they had successfully validated the Pristine M process in their laboratory and as a result entered into an agreement with the Company. The agreement between the University and the Company is for the reassembly of the second generation test facility. As of the date of this filing the University has advanced a total of approx. $1,300,000 directly to the manufacturer of the Rotary Kiln that was delivered to our site in Wyoming in June 2020.
•
The Company has been engaged with AusTrade (The Australian Trade and Investment Commission) and through that relationship has partnered with three separate universities in Australia. Like the University of Wyoming these Universities have a focus on their local coal both from a beneficiation perspective and also extracting derivative by products from coal using our technology. The Company received full Australian patents in Q2, 2019 so the company plans to move forward with this relationship in Q3 2021 following the assembly of the second-generation test facility.
•
The Company continues in discussions with the Minister for Coal in India and a number of the Energy governmental bodies in India. Coal samples are expected to be sent for testing once the Second Generation Test Facility is assembled which is expected in Q3, 2021.
•
Meetings occurred in Q2, 2019 with the US DOE, DOD and Wyoming State Representatives to further our technology to benefit US coal. These discussions continue through March, 2021 in light of the recent coal mining bankruptcies in Wyoming.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had two full-time executives. President and CEO Robin Eves, Chief Operations Officer and Aiden Neary, Chief Financial Officer have written employment agreements. Messrs. Eves and Neary received no compensation for their participation on the Board of Directors.
Factors Affecting Results of Operations
Our operating expenses include the following:
●
Consulting expenses, which consist primarily of amounts paid for technology development and design and engineering services;
●
General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and related benefits paid to our employees, as well as office and travel expenses;
●
Research and development expenses, which consist primarily of equipment and materials used in the development and testing of our technology; and
●
Legal and professional expenses, which consist primarily of amounts paid for patent protections, audit, disclosure, and reporting services.
Results of Operations
The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. We have generated limited revenues from inception to date. We anticipate that we may not receive any significant revenues from operations until we begin to receive royalty revenues from our coal testing plant which we estimate will be approximately 12 months after the successful signing of a commercial agreement anticipated in quarter three of fiscal 2021. We are also in preliminary discussions with companies, business groups, consortiums in the USA and Asia to license our technology, which, if successful, could realize limited short-term revenue opportunities from the signing of technology licensing agreements.
For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
We had no direct revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we received $100,000 as a non- refundable deposit on a two million ton license agreement from Wyoming New Power, a related party. The definitive license agreement is expected to be completed in 2020 following the assembly of the second generation test facility. In the year ended December 31, 2012, we have received an initial license fee of $375,000 from Jindal paid pursuant to the signing of our coal testing plant construction contract. The balance of $375,000 will be due upon the successful testing of Jindal coal in our second generation test facility in Wyoming. We do not anticipate any significant royalty fees for approximately 12-18 months thereafter.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $2,497,967 compared to $2,061,978 for the prior year. The $435,989 increase is mainly due to a $969,158 increase in research and development expenses, partially offset by a $396,666 decrease in general and administrative expenses and $4,964 decrease in consulting services and a $131,539 increase in gains on forgiveness of accounts payable.
Other Income and Expenses
Total other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3,826,304, compared to $2,968,470 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other expenses consists of $3,152,623 in interest expense on convertible debt and related amortization of debt discounts, $125,262 in debt default and standstill expenses related to convertible notes payable and $548,419 in fair value losses as a result of conversion options on convertible debt. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2,669,079 in interest expense and $299,391 in debt default and standstill expenses related to convertible notes payable.
Net Income/Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a net loss of $6,324,271, compared to a net loss of $5,030,448 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net losses for 2020 and 2019 are due to the $3,826,304 and $2,968,470 in other expenses and $2,497,967 and $2,061,978 in operating expenses as discussed above, respectively.
We anticipate losses from operations will increase during the next twelve months due to anticipated increased payroll expenses as we add necessary staff and increases in legal and accounting expenses associated with maintaining a reporting company. We expect that we will continue to have net losses from operations for several years until revenues from operating facilities become sufficient to offset operating expenses, unless we are successful in the sale of licenses for our technology.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have generated minimal revenues since inception. We have obtained cash for operating expenses through advances and/or loans from affiliates and stockholders, the sale of common stock, the issuance of loans and convertible debentures converted or convertible to common stock and the receipt of $375,000 in license fees from Jindal as described above.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we used $874,119 and $1,605,781 in cash from operations, mainly due to the net losses discussed above, net of non-cash operating expenses of $2,527,355 and $1,921,582 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our primary uses of funds in operations were payments made to our consultants and employees, legal and professional costs as well as travel and office expenses.
Net Cash Provided By Investing Activities.
We had no cash flows from investing activities in 2020 and 2019.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $786,040 and $1,672,318, respectively.

We repaid $162,500 and $565,562 on convertible notes, $11,500 and $165,000 on notes payable to related parties and $0 and $25,000 on convertible notes payable to related parties in cash during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We paid $20,000 in debt issue costs during the year ended December 31, 2020, we had no such costs during the prior year.
Cash Position and Outstanding Indebtedness.
Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $23,254,115 and $19,020,248, respectively, which consists of $23,191,339 and $17,951,784 of current liabilities and $332,776 and $1,068,464 of long-term debt, respectively. Current liabilities consist primarily of accounts payable, accounts payable to related parties, short-term debt, related party convertible debt and accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2020, our current assets were cash totaling $4,203. At December 31, 2019 we had current assets of $131,501, consisting of $92,282 of cash and $39,219 of prepaid assets. Our working capital deficit at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $23,187,136 and $17,840,050 and $12,804,911, respectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we have two full-time executives, President and CEO Robin Eves and Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial Officer Aiden Neary, who have written employment agreements. Mr. Eves and Neary received no compensation for their participation on the Board of Directors.
On July 1, 2020, we entered into two year employment agreements with Robin Eves as President and Chief Executive Officer and Aiden Neary as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director. Mr. Eves receives an annual salary of $525,000. Mr. Neary receives an annual salary of $500,000. Each officer was also granted 750,000 common shares upon signing the contract.
The terms of the agreements described above were negotiated by and between the individuals and our Board of Directors based on the qualifications and requirements of each individual and the needs of the company.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We secured a permanent location in Gillette, Wyoming for our test facility. The term of the lease is three years and calls for rent of $36,000, prepaid. We are currently negotiating an additional three year lease under the same terms and conditions.
We lease office space in New York, NY on a month to month basis, at a monthly rate of $200 per month.
Our engineering consultants has tentatively estimated construction costs for each one million short ton coal complete cleaning facility of approximately $250 million (excluding land costs) or costs and for a similar size Pristine-M-only facility of approximately $30-35 million (excluding land costs). All intellectual property rights associated with new art developed by our engineering consultants remain our property.
We are also actively pursuing technology license and royalty agreements in order to begin construction of other facilities without incurring the capital costs associated with the construction of future plants.
In November 2015, we entered into a month to month agreement with South of the Rose communication to manage our Investor Relations needs and manage social media requirements.
Construction of the coal testing plant was completed in 2015 and testing commenced in December 2015 at the AES Coal Power Utility in Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2020, we have paid $11,224,468 in development costs. The facility was moved to Wyoming in the first quarter of 2019. We anticipate that there will be an additional cost of approximately $4 million to acquire the additional parts for the second generation test facility and for its assembly.
Based on our current operational costs and including the capital requirements for our project deployments, we estimate we will need a total of approximately $5,500,000 to fund the Company for the fiscal year 2021 for plant re-assembly and operating costs and an additional $4,000,000 to continue for the following fiscal year (2022) or until an initial commercial plant is up and running.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
