Overview
We are a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing small molecules to restore neuronal health and stop neurodegeneration. With our product candidates, we aim to provide rapid cognitive improvement and alter the course of neurological diseases with our novel mechanism of action. Our approach is designed to augment neuronal growth factor signaling through the hepatocyte growth factor/MET, or HGF/MET, a naturally occurring regenerative system. We believe enhancing HGF/MET signaling has the potential to protect existing neurons from damage, reduce inflammation, promote regeneration, and positively modulate brain activity. We anticipate that all of these characteristics may improve neuronal health and translate into clinical benefits. Our pipeline is built from our proprietary drug discovery platform, or ATH platform, and consists of a series of small molecules that are designed to target either (1) the central nervous system, or CNS, by crossing the blood brain barrier, or BBB, or (2) the peripheral nervous system.
Our lead candidate, ATH-1017, is a subcutaneous administered, BBB-penetrating, small molecule HGF/MET activator. In our Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials, ATH-1017 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. These clinical trials recruited 88 subjects, including 11 subjects with mild-to-moderate AD, who were assigned to treatment and control groups. Nonclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials with ATH-1017 demonstrated improvements in brain network activity indicating potentially positive effects on brain function. In the AD subjects, multiple dosing of ATH-1017 significantly improved P300 latency. P300 latency is a functional measure that is highly correlated with cognition; however, we have not yet established a connection between these P300 latency results and improved cognition. In September 2020, we began site initiation and patient screening for LIFT-AD, our Phase 2/3 clinical trial for ATH-1017 that may provide pivotal data in support of registration, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD, with topline results expected by the end of 2022. In November 2020, we also initiated ACT-AD, a P300 Phase 2 clinical trial, in mild-to-moderate AD to better understand the overall effects of ATH-1017 on working memory processing speed and cognitive measures, with topline results expected by early 2022. Beyond AD, we believe that ATH-1017 can potentially address the broader dementia patient population.
The following figure illustrates the current development stages of our ATH compounds and discovery and development programs. In addition, we are expanding our ATH platform to additional indications in the CNS and peripheral nervous system as we aim to improve neuronal health in multiple disorders. Our drug
discovery efforts are focused on exploring the potential of ATH technology, which is designed to promote HGF/MET activity for a variety of clinical applications.
(1)
RoA: route of administration; SC: subcutaneous; PO: oral.
(2)
ATH-1017 for AD is moving from Phase 1b to a Phase 2/3 clinical trial that may provide pivotal data in support of registration based on discussions with FDA.
(3)
We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in PDD based on results from Phase 1a and 1b clinical trials in AD with ATH-1017. A second IND for PDD can cross-reference the already active IND for AD. It is not required that we repeat any studies or trials that are applicable across the two indications for the second IND for PDD, including a Phase 1 clinical trial.
We constantly strive to grow and optimize our portfolio through in-house discovery and plan on additional external business development activities enabled by our innovative internal research and development capabilities.
We were incorporated in March 2011 and since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development efforts such as small molecule compound discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as manufacturing activities, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for commercial sale, and we have not generated any revenues related to our products since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on the successful development of one or more of our product candidates which we expect will take a number of years.
We are focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics which enables us to use well-established and widely available manufacturing processes and infrastructure, formulation compositions and drug administration technologies or devices. We do not currently operate our own facilities for manufacturing, storing, or distributing our product candidates. We utilize third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials during the development of our product candidates. We believe the synthesis of ATH-1017 is reliable and reproducible and the synthetic methods can be further optimized to enable large-scale production that continues to avoid use of toxic materials or specialized equipment or handling during the manufacturing process. We plan to continue to optimize the manufacturing process to support future large-scale and commercial supply. Our
goal is to identify and develop small molecule product candidates that are cost-effective to manufacture and easily transferable to third party CMOs. We expect to use similar contract resources for commercialization of our products, at least until our resources and operations are at a scale that justifies investment in internal manufacturing capabilities.
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of our product candidates. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we will also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities.
To date, we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity securities, including proceeds from the sale and issuance of common stock in our IPO, the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock, common stock warrants, and convertible notes, and to a lesser extent from grant income and stock option exercises. From inception to December 31, 2020, we have raised aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately $310.6 million primarily from the issuance of our common stock, convertible preferred stock, common stock warrants, and convertible notes. We have incurred significant operating losses to date. Our net losses were $19.9 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $41.0 million and cash, cash equivalents and investments of $268.2 million.
We expect to continue to incur increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we:
•
continue to advance ATH-1017 and our other product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials, including our Phase 2/3 clinical trial for ATH-1017 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD;
•
expand our pipeline of product candidates;
•
continue to grow our discovery organization and invest in the ATH platform;
•
ramp up manufacturing activities;
•
attract, hire and retain additional personnel;
•
obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
operate as a public company;
•
relocate to our new facility and build out lab space;
•
implement operational, financial and management information systems;
•
seek regulatory approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; and
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval.
Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities.
We will require substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and further the development of our product candidates. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, which could include income from collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements, for the foreseeable future. Adequate funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital as needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue development of our product candidates. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and
volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise. If we fail to obtain necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, it could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities. Based upon our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through 2022.
The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, supply chain, operations and clinical development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our clinical trial enrollment, trial sites, contract research organizations, or CROs, third-party manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we do business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. To the extent possible, we are conducting business as usual, with necessary or advisable modifications to employee travel and most of our employees working remotely. We will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to COVID-19 and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business. At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans, including the resulting impact on our expenditures and capital needs, remains uncertain.
Initial Public Offering
In September 2020, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. As part of the IPO, we issued and sold 12,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $186.4 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $14.3 million and offering costs of approximately $3.3 million. In October 2020, we sold an additional 1,397,712 shares of common stock to the underwriters of the IPO upon partial exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares at the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering costs of approximately $1.7 million resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $22.1 million.
Recent Developments
Follow-on Public Offering
In January 2021, we completed a follow-on public offering of our common stock. As part of the follow-on offering, we issued and sold 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $84.1 million from the follow-on offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs. In February 2021, we sold an additional 600,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters of the follow-on public offering upon full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares at the follow-on public offering price of $22.50 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs resulting in net proceeds to use of approximately $12.7 million.
Our Collaboration and Grant Agreements
Washington State University Research Foundation License Agreement and Amended and Restated Washington State University License Agreement
In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Washington State University Research Fund, or WSURF, which, after the dissolution of WSURF in 2013, was superseded by an
amended and restated exclusive license agreement with Washington State University, or WSU, in September of 2015. Under this agreement, WSU granted us an exclusive license to make, use, sell, and offer for sale licensed products and licensed processes that embody the licensed patents (including WSU’s rights to a patent jointly owned with Pacific Northwest Biotechnology, Inc.) and that form the underlying technology of the drug therapies we are developing. The term of the license begins on the effective date and continues until the earlier of the date in which no valid claim remains enforceable and the payment of royalties ceases for more than four consecutive quarters after such royalty payments begin.
The initiation of our first Phase 2 clinical trial in September 2020 triggered a $50,000 liability to WSU, which was repaid in full as of December 31, 2020.
We are obligated to pay to WSU the following if the related milestones are reached:
•
$300,000 - At initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States, European Union or Japan for the first licensed product.
•
$600,000 - Marketing approval in the United States, European Union or Japan for the first licensed product.
We are obligated to pay WSU a royalty in the mid-single digits of net sales.
Additionally, under the agreement we have the right to sublicense the licensed rights, subject to additional payments to WSU for sublicense consideration received. Such amounts are dependent on the terms of the underlying sublicense, and range from the mid-single digits to mid tens of any non-sales based payments received, and low twenties of net sales based sublicense royalties.
Grant Liability
In 2014 and 2015, we received $250,000 and $500,000, respectively, from the Washington Life Sciences Discovery Fund, or LSDF, under the terms of two matching grant award agreements. The consummation of our initial public offering in September 2020 was a triggering event under the terms of the grant and the liability was remeasured to the pay-off amount of $1.5 million as of September 30, 2020 and repaid in full as of December 31, 2020.
National Institutes of Health Grant
In December 2020, we determined that we would accept a grant from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to support our ACT-AD Phase 2 clinical trial for ATH-1017. Under the terms of the agreement, we may receive approximately $7.8 million with the potential for an additional $7.4 million up to an aggregate of $15.2 million. For additional information regarding this grant, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Business-Our Collaboration and Grant Agreements.” We recognized $1.1 million of income related to our NIH grant in 2020 and at December 31, 2020, carried on the accompanying balance sheet an unbilled receivable of $1.1 million for reimbursable expenses.
Part the Cloud
In January 2019, the Alzheimer’s Association awarded us a $1.0 million Part the Cloud research grant. Grant proceeds must be used to advance our ATH-1017 product candidate in the Alzheimer’s disease setting. Reporting of expenses incurred supported by the grant as well as research updates are sent to the Alzheimer’s Association semi-annually. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $776,000 in 2019 and received the remaining $224,000 in March 2021 after having completed certain development milestones in October 2020. We recognize income related to the Part the Cloud research grant as qualifying expenses under the grant agreement are incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $246,000 and $754,000, respectively, in grant income associated with the Part the Cloud research grant. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred qualifying expenses in excess of cash received of approximately $224,000, which is included in unbilled grant receivable on the consolidated balance
sheets. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash received in excess of qualifying expenses of approximately $22,000, a liability for which was included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.
Components of Operating Results
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and indirect costs incurred for our research activities, including development of the ATH platform, our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. Direct costs include laboratory materials and supplies, contracted research and manufacturing, clinical trial costs, consulting fees, and other expenses incurred to sustain our research and development program. Indirect costs include personnel-related expenses, consisting of employee salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development activities, and facilities, including expenses associated with relocating to and building out our new lab space, and other expenses consisting of direct and allocated expenses for rent and depreciation, and lab consumables.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used over time for research and development are capitalized and recognized as goods are delivered or as the related services are performed. In-licensing fees and other costs to acquire technologies used in research and development that have not yet received regulatory approval and that are not expected to have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred. We track direct costs by stage of program, clinical or preclinical. However, we do not track indirect costs on a program specific basis because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified.
As of the date of this report, we cannot reasonably determine the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. Product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, as our product candidates advance into later stages of development, as we begin to conduct larger clinical trials, as we seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, as we expand our product pipeline, as we maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, and as we incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. In particular, we expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially as we initiate and conduct current and planned Phase 2 and Phase 2/3 clinical trials for ATH-1017.
The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Our research and development expenses may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•
the number and scope of preclinical and IND-enabling studies;
•
the phases of development of our product candidates;
•
the progress and results of our research and development activities;
•
per subject trial costs;
•
the number of trials required for regulatory approval, in particular with respect to ATH-1017 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects and initiate clinical trials;
•
the number of subjects that participate in the trials;
•
the drop-out and discontinuation rate of subjects;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of subject participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the cost and timing of manufacturing of our product candidates;
•
the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
the hiring and retention of research and development personnel;
•
the degree to which we obtain, maintain, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights;
•
the impact of COVID-19 on timelines and clinical operations, which may lead to increased costs; and
•
the extent to which we establish collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements and the performance of any related third parties.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, consisting of employee salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for our employees in the executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include third-party costs such as legal costs, insurance costs, accounting, auditing and tax related fees, consulting fees and facilities and other expenses not otherwise included as research and development expenses. We expense general and administrative costs as incurred.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our programs. We also anticipate that we will incur substantially increased expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, legal, auditing, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business.
Grant Income
Grant income consists of income related to the Part the Cloud and NIH grants and is recognized as qualifying expenses under the grant agreements are incurred. We expect grant income associated with the NIH grant will increase in future years, as we expect qualifying expenses under the grant terms to increase substantially in relation to our continued research activities and development of our programs. Under the terms of the agreement, we may receive approximately $7.8 million, with the potential for an additional $7.4 million, up to an aggregate of $15.2 million.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, periodic mark-to-market gains and losses on the derivative, grant, and convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities carried at fair value, and interest expense on our convertible notes. In the future, we
expect investment income to be the primary component of other income, net as the mark-to-market liabilities and convertible notes were all settled in 2020 and will no longer be adjusted to fair value.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented:
Research and Development Expenses
The following table shows the primary components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented:
Research and development expenses increased by $9.5 million, from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in expenses for ATH-1017 of $8.0 million related to start-up activities by our clinical research organization and clinical drug supply manufacturers for Phase 2 clinical trials, and to a lesser extent, by increases in personnel-related costs due primarily to an increase in headcount, facilities, and other costs supporting our general growth.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $5.0 million, from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate legal, accounting, technical and consulting services of $1.7 million, an increase in personnel-related costs of $1.9 million, due primarily to an increase in headcount to support our continued growth, and to a lesser extent, by increases in insurance and other administrative costs.
Grant Income
Grant income increased by $0.6 million, from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven by our acceptance of the NIH grant, under which we recognized grant income of $1.1 million, offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in grant income recognized associated with our Part the Cloud grant.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net, changed from expense of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to expense of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million in losses of liabilities recorded at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, offset by a gain of $0.2 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 upon extinguishment of convertible notes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale and issuance of common stock, convertible preferred stock, common stock warrants, and convertible notes, and to a lesser extent from grant income and stock option exercises. From our inception through December 31, 2020, we have raised aggregate net cash proceeds of $310.6 million primarily from the issuance of our common stock, convertible preferred stock, common stock warrants, and convertible notes. Net cash proceeds in 2020 totaled $294.3 million.
Recent sales of our common stock were as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, we had $268.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and have not generated positive cash flows from operations. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development efforts such as small molecule compound discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as manufacturing activities, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
Future Funding Requirements
Based upon our current operating plan, we estimate that our $268.2 million of cash, cash equivalents, and investments at December 31, 2020 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the 12 months following the date of this report. We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund the development of our product candidates. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, or other capital, which could include income from collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements with third parties, or receiving research contributions, or grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or
restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. Adequate funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise. If we fail to obtain necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, it could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flows from operating activities.
We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of biotechnology products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the scope, timing, progress and results of our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates;
•
the number of trials required for regulatory approval, in particular with respect to ATH-1017 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials of other product candidates that we may pursue;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, and the financial terms of any such arrangements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty or other payments due thereunder;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;
•
any expenses needed to attract, hire and retain skilled personnel;
•
the costs of operating as a public company;
•
the costs associated with relocating to our new facility and building out lab space; and
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other companies’ product candidates and technologies.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other factors with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plan may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plan.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $24.1 million. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $19.9 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.3 million and an increase in our net operating assets of $6.5 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense and accretion of discounts on our convertible notes, changes in the carrying value of liabilities stated at fair value, and the gain on extinguishment of our convertible notes. The increase in our net operating assets was due to an increase in unbilled grant receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease in grant liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $3.7 million. This consisted primarily of a net loss of $5.2 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $0.8 million and an increase in our net operating assets of $0.7 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense and accretion of discounts on our convertible notes, and changes in the carrying value of liabilities stated at fair value. The increase in our net operating assets was due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $210.1 million. This consisted primarily of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $226.8 million and purchases of property and equipment of $2.3 million, partially offset by maturities of available-for-sale securities of $19.1 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 million. This consisted primarily of $2.5 million in proceeds received from short-term investments which matured during the period, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $1.0 million.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $292.8 million. This consisted primarily of net proceeds received from our IPO of $208.5 million, net proceeds of $81.9 million from the issuance of our Series B convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants, $1.7 million from the issuance of our convertible notes, and to a lesser extent from exercises of stock options and common stock warrants.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.9 million. This consisted primarily of proceeds of $0.9 million from the issuance of our convertible notes and to a lesser extent from exercises of stock options.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information requested by this item pursuant to Item 303(d) of Regulation S-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
Derivative Liability, Convertible Notes Discount and Amortization
Our convertible notes had conversion and redemption features that met the definition of an embedded derivative and were therefore subject to derivative accounting. The initial fair value of the derivative was recorded as a discount to the convertible notes, with a corresponding derivative liability. The discount to the convertible notes was amortized using the effective interest method. The amortization of the discount was included in other income (expense), net in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The derivative liability related to these features was recorded at estimated fair value on a recurring basis. Any changes in fair value were reflected in other income (expense), net in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each period end while such instruments were outstanding. The derivative liability was remeasured to fair value until its settlement in May 2020 upon the conversion of the underlying convertible notes into shares of our Series B-1 convertible preferred stock.
Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability
Freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock were accounted for as liabilities at fair value, because the shares underlying the warrants contained contingent redemption features outside our control. Warrants classified as liabilities are recorded on the balance sheets at their fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured to fair value on each subsequent reporting period, with the changes in fair value recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the statements of operations. The liability is adjusted for changes in the fair value of these warrants until the earlier of the exercise of the warrants, the expiration of the warrants, or until such time as the warrants are no longer considered liability instruments. The convertible preferred stock warrant liability was remeasured to fair value until its settlement in September 2020 upon the net exercise of warrants in connection with our IPO.
Grant Liability
The grant liability associated with the grants from the LSDF is accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 825-10, Financial Instruments-Overall. The estimated fair value of the grant liability is reassessed at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each period end. The fair value of the grant liability was estimated using a discounted cash flow simulation methodology that assigns
probabilities to the timing and likelihood of each triggering event, each of which is disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, as well as a discount rate based on market data for securities with similar durations and credit ratings to us, and the expected payment amount. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the grant liability are subject to significant judgment, and payment may be in an amount different from the liability that we estimate. The consummation of our IPO in September 2020 was a triggering event under the terms of the grant and the liability was remeasured to the pay-off amount of $1.5 million as of September 30, 2020 and repaid in full as of December 31, 2020.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. In-licensing fees and other costs to acquire technologies used in research and development that have not yet received regulatory approval and that are not expected to have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used over time for research and development are capitalized and recognized as goods are delivered or as the related services are performed. We estimate the period over which such services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If actual timing of performance or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the amounts recorded accordingly. We have not experienced any material differences between accrued or prepaid costs and actual costs since inception.
Stock-based Compensation
We maintain a stock-based compensation plan as a long-term incentive for employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The plan allows for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and other forms of equity awards.
We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. Our stock-based compensation costs are based upon the grant date fair value of options estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. To the extent any stock option grants are made subject to the achievement of a performance-based milestone, management evaluates when the achievement of any such performance-based milestone is probable based on the relative satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizes inputs which are highly subjective assumptions and generally require significant judgment. These assumptions include:
•
Fair Value of Common Stock. See the subsection titled “-Common Stock Valuations” below.
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option.
•
Expected Volatility. Because we have been privately held and do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded life sciences companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on the similar size, stage in life cycle or area of specialty. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
•
Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term), as we do not have sufficient historical data to use any other method to estimate expected term.
•
Expected Dividend Yield. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.
See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our stock options. Certain of such assumptions involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different.
We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was $3.9 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options which we expect to recognize over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.75 years. We expect to continue to grant stock options and other equity-based awards in the future, and to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.
Common Stock Valuations
Historically, for all periods prior to our IPO, since there was no public market of our common stock, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. To determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, input from management, valuations of our common stock prepared by unrelated third-party valuation firms in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2013 Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, and our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These factors include, but are not limited to:
•
our results of operations and financial position, including our levels of available capital resources;
•
our stage of development and material risks related to our business;
•
progress of our research and development activities;
•
our business conditions and projections;
•
the valuation of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed mergers and acquisitions of peer companies;
•
the lack of marketability of our common stock as a private company;
•
the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions;
•
the rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;
•
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for our securityholders, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions;
•
the hiring of key personnel and the experience of management;
•
trends and developments in our industry; and
•
external market conditions affecting the life sciences and biotechnology industry sectors.
For our valuations performed prior to December 31, 2019, we used the option pricing method, or OPM, back-solve method. In an OPM framework, the back-solve method for inferring the equity value implied by a recent financing transaction involves making assumptions for the expected time to liquidity, volatility and risk-free rate and then solving for the value of equity such that value for the most recent
financing equals the amount paid. This method was selected as management concluded that the contemporaneous financing transaction was an arms-length transaction.
For our valuations performed subsequent to December 31, 2019, we used a hybrid method of the OPM and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM. PWERM considers various potential liquidity outcomes. Our approach included the use of an initial public offering scenario and a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity. Under the hybrid OPM and PWERM method, the per share value calculated under the OPM and PWERM are weighted based on expected exit outcomes and the quality of the information specific to each allocation methodology to arrive at a final estimated fair value per share of the common stock before a discount for lack of marketability is applied.
Since the completion of our IPO in September 2020, our board of directors will determine the fair market value of our common stock based on its closing price as reported on the date of grant on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Income Taxes
We recognize deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. In evaluating our valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $9.4 million of federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and $1.3 million of tax credit carryforwards which expire over a period of 11 to 17 years. As of December 31, 2020, we had $29.1 million of such NOLs that do not expire.
Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards that could be used annually in the future to offset taxable income. The tax benefits related to future utilization of federal and state NOL carryforwards, credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets may be limited or lost if cumulative changes in ownership exceeds 50% within any three-year period. We have not completed a Section 382/383 analysis under the Code regarding the limitation of NOL and credit carryforwards. If a change in ownership were to have occurred, the annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL carryforwards and credits before utilization.
We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities or reduce the underlying tax attribute, as applicable, and adjust them when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to
use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (1) are no longer an emerging growth company or (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have at least $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.
