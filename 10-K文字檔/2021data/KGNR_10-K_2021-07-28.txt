DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY
The Company was a startup company that was incorporated in Nevada on August 16, 2013.
We have had limited operations and have been issued a “going concern” opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our operations for the near future.
The following Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Form 10-K.
COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 TO THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017
Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, and related management discussion herein.
Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”).
Going Concern Qualification
Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $1,320,254 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through debt or future issuances of capital stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our operating results for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, and the changes between those periods for the respective items, are summarized as follows:
Revenues
We did not earn any revenues during the year ended November 30, 2018 or 2017.
Operating Loss
Our loss from operations increased to $84,865 during the year ended November 30, 2018, from an operating loss of $80,467 in the comparative year ended November 30, 2017. The following table presents operating expenses for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017:
The Company recorded $66,312 in consulting fees during the year ended November 30, 2018, as compared to $57,688 for the prior fiscal year, due to signed advisory board agreements. We realized a decrease of $4,226 in general and administrative expenses during the year ended November 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
Other Income (Expense)
The following table presents other income and expenses for the year ended November 30, 2018 and 2017:
During the year ended November 30, 2018 the Company recognized loss on debt settlement of $452,378 due to shares issued for debt to related party. During the year ended November 30, 2018 the Company recognized an unrealized loss on marketable securities of $74,751 due to revaluation of marketable securities. For the prior fiscal year, the Company recorded interest expense of $5,395, and amortization of debt discount of $2,170.
Net Loss
The Company incurred a $611,994 net loss during the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to net loss of $88,032 in the prior fiscal year. This is primarily due to loss on settlement of debt, and unrealized loss on marketable securities recognized during the year ended November 30, 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Based upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
Working Capital
The following table presents our working capital position as of November 30, 2018 and 2017:
The change in working capital during the year ended November 30, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in current assets of $141,140 and a decrease in current liabilities of $13,675. Current assets decreased primarily due to revaluation of investment in marketable securities and amortization of prepaid consulting expense. Current liabilities decreased primarily due to debt settlement to related party of $32,151. Cash reduced as of August 31, 2018, by $77 to $0.
Cash Flow
We fund our operations with cash received from advances from officers and related parties and issuances of equity.
The following tables presents our cash flow for the year ended November 30, 2018 and 2017:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We did not generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the year ended November 30, 2018 or 2017.
For the year ended November 30, 2018, net cash flows used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of $611,994, reduced by unrealized loss on marketable securities of $74,751, loss on settlement of debt of $452,378 and by a net increase in change of operating assets and liabilities of $77,762.
For the year ended November 30, 2017, net cash flows used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of $88,032, reduced by amortization of debt discount of $2,170, interest expense converted to common stock of $5,395, issuance of common stock for consulting services valued at $57,688 and net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6,050.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For the year ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, we received $7,026 and $16,651, respectively, in advances from related parties, which were used to fund operations and business activities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period for intangible assets, valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets, depreciable lives of the web site and property and equipment, valuation of warrant and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts, valuation of share-based payments and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
Investments in Equity
We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.
