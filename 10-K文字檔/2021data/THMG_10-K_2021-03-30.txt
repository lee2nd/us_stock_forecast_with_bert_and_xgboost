ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying integral notes (“Notes”) thereto. The following statements may be forward-looking in nature and actual results may differ materially.
Plan of Operation:
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: inability to locate property with mineralization, lack of financing for exploration efforts, competition to acquire mining properties; risks inherent in the mining industry, and risk factors that are listed in the Company's reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company re-started the advancement of the South Mountain Project in 2019 with BeMetals Corp. - Vancouver B.C. (TSX-V: BMET) - under an option agreement to complete the pre-development work and produce a preliminary economic analysis (PEA). The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months is to continue supporting BeMetals Corp. during their option period and help ensure that the South Mountain PEA is completed on schedule and within budget.
Results of Operations:
In 2020, the Company recorded net income of $1,216,681, or $0.02 per share compared to a net income of $1,082,083, or $0.02 per share for the same period of 2019. The increase of $134,598 is due to the unrealized gain on investment related to the 10,000,000 shares of BeMetals Corp. common stock beneficially held. The 2019 BeMetals common stock carrying value is adjusted by subsequent quarterly changes in stock price of the BeMetals common stock (See South Mountain Project above). On June 10, 2019, the Company received 10,000,000 shares of BeMetals Corp. common stock that had a fair value of $1,883,875 when received. On December 31, 2020, the fair value of the shares is $3,018,634.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recognized $300,000 in management services income and gain on mineral interest of $250,000 during the twelve-months for a total of $550,000 in total revenue. In 2019, the Company recorded $200,000 in Management Service income and gain on BeMetals shares resulted in mineral interest of $1,754,398 which resulted total revenue of $1,954,398. The comparison of Total revenue of year ended December 31, 2020 to 2019 results in a $1,404,398 decrease attributed to shares of BeMetals common stock with a fair value of $1,883,875 received in June of 2019.
Total operating expenses for the period ending December 31, 2020 of $646,682 decreased from the same respective time period in 2019 by $48,613 or 7%. Exploration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $15,461 when compared to same period in 2019. Legal and accounting costs decreased for the year ended December
31, 2020 compared to 2019 by $78,672 for a total of $56,343. This decrease can be associated with legal expenses surrounding the BeMetals Option Agreement signed on February 27, 2019. Management and administrative expense increased by $56,874 or 11% principally due to stock options compensation of $159,740 issued to our officers and directors on March 30, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources:
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we have sufficient cash reserves to cover normal operating expenditures for the following 12 months.
The liquidity of the Company was enhanced on February 27, 2019 when the Company entered into the BeMetals Option Agreement with BeMetals Corp., and BMET USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals. Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA will be entitled to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of SMMI from TMRI, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The term of the agreement is for two years with BeMetals completing a preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") completed by a mutually agreed third-party engineering firm. Over its term, this agreement requires cash payments to the Company of $1,350,000; $1,100,000 in cash and $250,000 in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock. Through December 31, 2020, cash proceeds of $600,000 and $250,000 in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock have been received. BeMetals also agreed to pay the Company $25,000 per month for management services. In the event that BeMetals decides not to proceed with the South Mountain Project, BeMetals will not be obligated to make any additional payments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 BeMetals spend respectively $1,732,027 and $1,312,462 on exploration of the South Mountain Mines property.
BeMetals issued 10 million BMET common shares (Consideration Shares) to TMRI (The Company`s wholly-owned subsidiary) in May 2019. The fair value of the shares on the transaction date was $1,883,875.
In April 2020, the Company received a loan of $48,000 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under Division A, Title I, Section 1102 and 1106 of the CARES Act. The loan, which was in the form of a promissory note, as amended, dated April 21, 2020 issued by the Company (the “Note”); the Note matures on April 13, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1% per annum, payable monthly commencing on August 13, 2021. The Note may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts of the loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying expenses.
On October 21, 2020, the Company completed its Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness application with Washington Trust Bank. On November 07, 2020, the Company received a notice that our loan was paid in full by Small Business Administration, and the PPP loan was forgiven.
The Company has historically incurred losses, however, under the BeMetals Option Agreement, the Company now has a recurring source of revenue, and its ability to continue as a going concern is no longer just dependent on equity capital raises and borrowings. The Company believes it has the ability to raise capital in order to fund its future exploration and working capital requirements if necessary.
Potential additional sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of our stock, or alternative methods such as mergers or sale of our assets. No assurances can be given, however, that we will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash.
Our plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include financing our future operations through sales of our common stock and/or debt and the potential exploitation of our mining properties. Our plans may also, at some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for equity in the property.
In addition to the BeMetals Corp. Option Agreement, we believe that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations because of the following:
·On March 5, 2021, we had $456,064 cash in our bank accounts.
·We do not include in this consideration any option payments mentioned below.
·Management is committed to manage expenses of all types to not exceed the on-hand cash resources of the Company at any point in time, now or in the future.
·The Company will also consider other sources of funding, including potential mergers, the sale of all or part of the Company`s BeMetals Corp. (TSX-V: BMET) common shares beneficially held, and/or additional farm-out of its other exploration property.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $271,260, consisting of net income of $1,221,681 offset by the non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $250,000 from the receipt of $250,000 under the BeMetals Option Agreement. Net cash distributions of financing activities were $5,000 to non-controlling interest.
Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including timing, cost and progress of our exploration efforts, our evaluation of, and decisions with respect to, our strategic alternatives, and costs associated with the regulatory approvals. If it turns out that we do not have enough cash to complete our exploration programs, we will attempt to raise additional funds from a public offering, a private placement, mergers, farm-outs or loans.
Additional financing may be required in the future to fund our planned operations. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional financing when necessary, we may have to delay our exploration efforts or any property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our mining claims.
Private Placement
On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Option Agreement, (the “BeMetals Option Agreement”) with BeMetals Corp., a British Columbia corporation (“BeMetals”), and BeMetals USA Corp., a Delaware corporation (“BMET USA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals. Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, in the second quarter 2019, BeMetals purchased 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.10 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250,000, in a private placement. Use of proceeds are for general corporate working capital. This private placement was approved by the TSX-V.
The offerings are believed exempt from registration pursuant to the exemption for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering under Section 4(6) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The securities offered, sold, and issued in connection with the private placement have not been or are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
Contractual Obligations

Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified our critical accounting policies, the application of which may materially affect the financial statements, either because of the significance of the financials statement item to which they relate, or because they require management’s judgment in making estimates and assumptions in measuring, at a specific point in time, events which will be settled in the future. The critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below:
a)Estimates. Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operation and/or financial condition.
b)Stock-based Compensation. The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
c)Income Taxes. We have current income tax assets recorded in our financial statements that are based on our estimates relating to federal and state income tax benefits. Our judgments regarding federal and state income tax rates, items that may or may not be deductible for income tax purposes and income tax regulations themselves are critical to the Company’s financial statement income tax items.
d)Investments. In a joint venture where the Company holds more than 50% of the voting interest and has significant influence, the joint venture is consolidated with the presentation of non-controlling interest. In determining whether significant influences exist, the Company considers its participation in policy-making decisions and its representation on the venture’s management committee.
