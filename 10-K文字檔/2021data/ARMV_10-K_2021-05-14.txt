Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.
We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019.
Our net loss for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 is $6,092 compared to a net loss of $5,855 during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019. During fiscal years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company has generated $0 in revenue.
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, we incurred professional fees of $5,964 and bank service charges of $128 compared to professional fees of $5,639 and bank service charges of $216 incurred during fiscal year ended October 31, 2019.
The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 6,240,000 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 and 6,240,000 for October 31, 2019.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.
Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank
financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
MATERIAL COMMITMENTS
As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.
PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors' reports accompanying our October 31, 2020 and 2019 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
