Executive Overview
The Company’s business is highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy. The Company’s strategy is to improve profitability by increasing yield while also increasing volumes to build density in existing geography and to pursue geographic expansion to promote profitable growth and improve our customer value proposition over time. The Company’s business is labor intensive, capital intensive and service sensitive. The Company looks for opportunities to improve safety, cost effectiveness and asset utilization (primarily tractors and trailers). Pricing initiatives have had a positive impact on yield and profitability. The Company continues to execute targeted sales and marketing programs along with initiatives to align costs with volumes and improve customer satisfaction. Technology continues to be an important investment that is improving customer experience, operational efficiencies and Company image.
COVID-19.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. We are considered an essential and critical business by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and will continue to operate under state of emergency and shelter in place orders issued in various jurisdictions across the country. Management has made a variety of efforts seeking to ensure the ongoing availability of Saia’s transportation services, while instituting actions and policies to help safeguard employees and customers from COVID-19, including limiting physical employee and customer contact, implementing enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols at Saia’s facilities, and instituting telecommuting where possible. Through the date of this filing, the Company has not experienced significant disruptions in the Company’s LTL network operations.
Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, we experienced lower demand for our transportation services along with increased costs and other challenges related to COVID-19 that adversely affected our business, particularly in the second quarter of 2020 with a subsequent rebound in volumes in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. We believe we have significant liquidity available to continue business operations during this volatile period. As discussed in the “Financial Condition” section below, the Company has a revolving credit facility (including a $100 million accordion feature that is available, subject to certain conditions and lender commitments) and other sources of borrowing in place that provides liquidity of up to $300 million in addition to its regular cash inflows
from operations. The Company was in compliance with the debt covenants under its debt agreements at December 31, 2020.
Overview.
The Company’s operating revenue increased by 2.0 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase resulted primarily from pricing actions, including a 5.9 percent general rate increase taken on February 3, 2020, for customers subject to general rate increases.
Consolidated operating income was $180.3 million for 2020 compared to $152.6 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 operating income resulted primarily from pricing actions as well as decreases in fuel costs, partially offset by salary and wage increases, higher purchase transportation costs, increased depreciation expense and slightly lower shipments due to the effects of COVID-19 on the first half of the year.
The Company generated $309.1 million in net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 versus $272.9 million in 2019. The Company used $218.8 million of net cash in investing activities during 2020 compared to $281.0 million during 2019.
On February 5, 2019, the Company entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with its banking group (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement). The amendment increased the amount of the revolver from $250 million to $300 million and extended the term until February 2024. The Amended Credit Agreement also has an accordion feature that allows for an additional $100 million availability, subject to lender approval compared to $75 million under the prior agreement. The amendment reduced the interest rate pricing grid compared to the prior agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a LIBOR rate margin range from 100 basis points to 200 basis points, base rate margins from minus 50 basis points to plus 50 basis points, an unused portion fee from 17.5 basis points to 30 basis points and letter of credit fees from 100 basis points to 200 basis points, in each case based on the Company’s leverage ratio.
The Company had $65.3 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2020 compared to $6.2 million of net cash provided by financing activities during 2019. The Company had a $71.9 million decrease in net borrowings (net of repayments) under its revolving credit facility during 2020 compared to 2019 and made scheduled principal payments for finance lease obligations of $19.5 million during 2020. Outstanding letters of credit were $29.0 million and the cash and cash equivalents balance was $25.3 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company had $272.8 million in remaining availability under its revolving credit facility and $71.0 million in obligations under finance leases at December 31, 2020. The Company was in compliance with the debt covenants under its debt agreements at December 31, 2020. See “Financial Condition” for a more complete discussion of these agreements.
General
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies of Saia, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (together, the Company or Saia). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements which include additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results.
Saia is a transportation company headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia that provides less-than-truckload (LTL) services through a single integrated organization. While more than 97% of its revenue is derived from transporting LTL shipments across 44 states, the Company also offers customers a wide range of other value-added services, including non-asset truckload, expedited and logistics services across the United States. The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Chief Executive Officer who manages the business, regularly reviews financial information and allocates resources. The Company has one operating segment.
Our business is highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy. Our business also is impacted by a number of other factors as discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”
The key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our network, as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage; the prices we obtain for our services, as measured by revenue per hundredweight (a measure of yield) and revenue per shipment; our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits; purchased transportation; claims and insurance expense; fuel and maintenance; and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels.
Results of Operations
Saia, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Selected Results of Operations and Operating Statistics
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
(in thousands, except ratios and revenue per hundredweight)
Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenue and volume
Consolidated revenue increased 2.0 percent to $1.8 billion primarily as a result of pricing actions and terminal expansion, partially offset by a decrease in fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices. The economic environment over the past few years permitted the Company to implement measured pricing actions to improve yield. As a result of these increased rates, along with increased length of haul, Saia’s LTL revenue per hundredweight (a measure of yield) increased 1.6 percent to $18.33 per hundredweight for 2020. Saia’s LTL tonnage also increased 0.1 percent per workday while LTL shipments decreased 0.9 percent per workday for 2020, as a result of lower volumes in the first half of 2020. Overall LTL revenue per shipment increased 2.6 percent in 2020 due to the yield improvements discussed above. Additionally, LTL weight per shipment increased 1.0 percent during 2020. For 2020 and 2019, approximately 75 to 80 percent of Saia’s operating revenue was subject to specific customer price adjustment negotiations that occur throughout the year. The remaining 20 to 25 percent of operating revenue was subject to a general rate increase which is based on market conditions. For customers subject to general rate increases, Saia implemented a 5.9 percent general rate increase on February 3, 2020. Competitive factors, customer turnover and mix changes, among other things, impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time.
Operating revenue includes fuel surcharge revenue from the Company’s fuel surcharge program. That program is designed to reduce the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by adjusting total freight charges to account for changes in the price of fuel. The Company’s fuel surcharge is generally based on the average national price for diesel fuel and is reset weekly. Fuel surcharges are widely accepted in the industry and are a significant component of revenue and pricing. Fuel surcharges are an integral part of customer contract negotiations but represent only one portion of overall customer price negotiations as customers may negotiate increases in base rates instead of increases in fuel surcharges or vice versa. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 11.1 percent of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 13.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of decreases in the cost of fuel.
Operating expenses and margin
Consolidated operating income was $180.3 million in 2020 compared to $152.6 million in 2019. In summary, the operations were favorably impacted in 2020 by higher tonnage and yield, which were partially offset by salary and wage increases, higher purchase transportation costs, and increased depreciation expense. The 2020 operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenue) decreased to 90.1 percent as compared to 91.5 percent in 2019.
Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased $15.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to an overall increase in paid time off, a result of the additional five days awarded to all hourly employees in dealing with the impacts of COVID-19, and higher healthcare benefit costs. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $40.8 million during 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to decreased fuel costs, in addition to a reduction of other operating expenses and supplies, partially attributable to the recalibration of our cost structure as volumes slowed in the first half of 2020. Claims and insurance expense in 2020 was $6.7 million higher than 2019 largely due to increased insurance premiums in 2020 along with accident severity, particularly in the first half of 2020. The Company can experience volatility in accident expense as a result of its self-insurance structure which provides for retention amounts ranging from $2 million to $10 million per occurrence. Depreciation expense increased $15.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to revenue equipment, real estate and technology investments in 2020. Purchased transportation expense increased $11.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to increased surges in demand in the latter half of 2020 and capacity constraints in the internal network.
Other
Substantially all non-operating expenses represent interest expense. Interest expense in 2020 was $1.5 million less than 2019 due to decreased average borrowings resulting from the $62.2 million decrease in investing activities in 2020. The effective income tax rate was 21.5 percent and 22.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2019 and 2020 effective income tax rates include the impact of the tax credits enacted in December 2019 for alternative fuel usage, resulting in an increase in earnings per share of $0.04 and $0.07 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 10 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the income tax provision, impacts of the alternative fuel tax credits and the effective tax rate.
Working capital/capital expenditures
Working capital at December 31, 2020 was negative $4.1 million which increased from working capital at December 31, 2019 of negative $8.9 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accrued taxes and claims and insurance accruals. Cash flows from operating activities were $309.1 million for 2020 versus $272.9 million for 2019 largely driven by increased profitability. For 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $218.8 million versus $281.0 million in 2019 primarily due to lower capital expenditures for real estate, technology and revenue equipment during 2020 due to management’s decision to reduce expenditures in light of uncertainty associated with COVID-19. Net cash used in financing activities was $65.3 million in 2020 versus $6.2 million in net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 primarily driven by a decrease in the net borrowings (net of repayments) under our revolving credit facility of $71.9 million from 2020 compared to 2019.
Year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018
Revenue and volume
Consolidated revenue increased 8.0 percent to $1.79 billion as a result of increased shipments, tonnage, fuel surcharges and pricing actions, including a 5.9 percent general rate increase taken February 18, 2019. Expansion into the Northeastern United States continued to be a contributing factor in the increased shipments and tonnage in 2019. The economic environment over the last couple of years permitted the Company to implement measured pricing actions to improve yield, which allowed Saia’s LTL revenue per hundredweight (a measure of yield) increasing 7.4 percent to $18.05 per hundredweight for 2019 primarily as a result of increased rates along with increased length of haul. Saia’s LTL tonnage also increased 0.4 percent per workday and LTL shipments increased 4.3 percent per workday for 2019. Overall LTL revenue per shipment increased 3.4 percent due to the yield improvements discussed above. This was somewhat offset by a decrease in LTL weight per shipment decreases of 3.8 percent during 2019, which was mainly driven by slower economic industrial production trends. For 2019 and 2018, approximately 75 to 80 percent of Saia’s operating revenue was subject to specific customer price adjustment negotiations that occur throughout the year. The remaining 20 to 25 percent of operating revenue was subject to a general rate increase which is based on market conditions. For customers subject to general rate increases, Saia implemented a 5.9 percent general rate increase on February 18, 2019. Competitive factors, customer turnover and mix changes, among other things, impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time.
Operating revenue includes fuel surcharge revenue from the Company’s fuel surcharge program. That program is designed to reduce the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by adjusting total freight charges to account for changes in the price of fuel. The Company’s fuel surcharge is generally based on the average national price for diesel fuel and is reset weekly. Fuel surcharges are widely accepted in the industry and are a significant component of revenue and pricing. Fuel surcharges are an integral part of customer contract negotiations but represent only one portion of overall customer price negotiations as customers may negotiate increases in base rates instead of increases in fuel surcharges or vice versa. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 13.0 percent of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 13.6 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of decreases in the cost of fuel.
Operating expenses and margin
Consolidated operating income was $152.6 million in 2019 compared to $141.2 million in 2018. In summary, the operations were favorably impacted in 2019 by higher tonnage, shipments, overall fuel surcharges and yield, which were offset by salary and wage increases, higher fuel and purchase transportation costs, increased depreciation expense and costs associated with the Company’s geographic expansion. The 2019 operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenue) was flat at 91.5 percent as compared to 2018.
Salaries, wages and benefit expense increased $75.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to higher wages associated with increased headcount in 2019, wage increases in July 2019 and 2018 and higher healthcare benefit costs. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $15.1 million during 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to increased costs of other operating expenses and supplies, including increased expenses related to the geographic expansion, partially offset by improved fuel efficiency from a newer fleet. Claims and insurance expense in 2019 was $4.6 million higher than 2018 largely due to increased insurance reserves in 2019 associated with accident severity partially offset by the benefit from the commutation of the first 12 month period of the bodily injury and property damage liability policy. The Company can experience volatility in accident expense as a result of its self-insurance structure which provides for retention amounts ranging from $2 million to $10 million per occurrence. Depreciation expense increased $17.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to revenue equipment, real estate and technology investments in 2019. Purchased transportation expense increased $6.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in purchased transportation cost per mile and utilization of purchased transportation carriers to maintain service requirements while supporting increased shipments, tonnage and length of haul throughout 2019.
Other
Substantially all non-operating expenses represent interest expense. Interest expense in 2019 was $1.3 million greater than 2018 due to increased average borrowings resulting from the $58.4 million increase in investing
activities in 2019. The effective income tax rate was 22.5 percent and 22.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2018 and 2019 effective income tax rates include the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 as well as the tax credits enacted in December 2019 for alternative fuel usage, resulting in an increase in earnings per share of $0.07 for 2019. See Note 10 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the income tax provision, impacts of the Tax Act and the effective tax rate.
Working capital/capital expenditures
Working capital at December 31, 2019 was negative $8.9 million which decreased from working capital at December 31, 2018 of $4.1 million. This decrease is primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, which requires the current portion of operating lease liability, $19.0 million at December 31, 2019, be recognized as a current liability at December 31, 2019. Additionally, the decrease in working capital was due to an increase in other current liabilities, mostly sales and use tax payables, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Cash flows from operating activities were $272.9 million for 2019 versus $256.4 million for 2018 largely driven by increased profitability. For 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $281.0 million versus $222.6 million in 2018 primarily due to higher capital expenditures for real estate, technology and revenue equipment during 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 million in 2019 versus $36.4 million in net cash used in financing activities for 2018 primarily driven by an increase in the net borrowings (net of repayments) under our revolving credit facility of $48.9 million from 2019 compared to 2018.
Outlook
Our business remains highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy and competitive pricing pressures, as well as the success of Company-specific improvement initiatives. There remains uncertainty as to the strength of economic conditions. We are continuing initiatives to increase yield, reduce costs and improve productivity. We focus on providing top quality service and improving safety performance. Planned revenue initiatives include, but are not limited to, building density in our current geography, targeted marketing initiatives to grow revenue in more profitable segments, further expanding our service geography, as well as pricing and yield management. On January 18, 2021 and February 3, 2020 Saia implemented 5.9 percent general rate increases, for customers comprising approximately 20 to 25 percent of Saia’s operating revenue. The extent of success of this revenue initiative is impacted by what proves to be the underlying economic trends, competitor initiatives and other factors discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”
Effective January 2021, the Company implemented a salary and wage increase of approximately 3.5 percent for all of its employees. The cost of the compensation increase is expected to be approximately $30.6 million annually, and the Company anticipates the impact will be partially offset by productivity and efficiency gains.
If the Company builds market share, including through its geographic expansion, it expects there to be numerous operating leverage cost benefits. Conversely, should the economy soften from present levels, the Company plans to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage. The success of cost improvement initiatives is also impacted by the cost and availability of drivers and purchased transportation, fuel, insurance claims, cost and availability of insurance, regulatory changes, successful expansion of our service geography and other factors discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”
See “Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2020
In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” Under this ASU an entity is required to utilize an “expected credit loss model” on certain financial instruments, including trade and financing receivables. This model requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information and requires an entity to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. This standard became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020 and upon adoption this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
Financial Condition
The Company's liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in new equipment, land and structures, information technology and letters of credit required under insurance programs, as well as funding working capital requirements.
The Company is party to a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to fund capital investments, letters of credit and working capital needs. The Company has pledged certain land and structures, accounts receivable and other assets to secure indebtedness under this agreement.
Credit Agreement
Prior to February 5, 2019, the Company was party to a Restated Credit Agreement with a group of banks that included a revolving credit facility for up to $250 million expiring in March 2020. The Restated Credit Agreement also had an accordion feature that allowed for an additional $75 million availability, subject to lender approval. The Restated Credit Agreement provided for a LIBOR rate margin range from 112.5 basis points to 225 basis points, base rate margins from minus 12.5 basis points to plus 50 basis points, an unused portion fee from 20 basis points to 30 basis points and letter of credit fees from 112.5 basis points to 225 basis points, in each case based on the Company’s leverage ratio. Under the Restated Credit Agreement, the Company was required to maintain certain financial covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, among others. The Restated Credit Agreement also provided for a pledge by the Company of certain land and structures, certain tractors, trailers and other personal property and accounts receivable, to secure indebtedness under the Restated Credit Agreement.
On February 5, 2019, the Company entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with its banking group (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement). The amendment increased the amount of the revolver from $250 million to $300 million and extended the term until February 2024. The Amended Credit Agreement also has an accordion feature that allows for an additional $100 million availability, subject to certain conditions and availability of lender commitments. The amendment reduced the interest rate pricing. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a LIBOR rate margin range from 100 basis points to 200 basis points, base rate margins from minus 50 basis points to plus 50 basis points, an unused portion fee from 17.5 basis points to 30 basis points and letter of credit fees from 100 basis points to 200 basis points, in each case based on the Company’s leverage ratio. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company must maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio set at 1.25 to 1.00 and a maximum leverage ratio set at 3.25 to 1.00. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a pledge by the Company of certain land and structures, accounts receivable and other assets to secure indebtedness under this agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, if an event of default occurs, the banks will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit line and outstanding letters of credit of $27.2 million under the Amended Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $45.9 million of outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of $26.1 million under the
Restated Credit Agreement. The available portion of the Amended Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and letter of credit requirements as needed.
Finance Leases
The Company is obligated under finance leases with seven year terms covering revenue equipment totaling $71.0 million and $90.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization of assets held under the finance leases is included in depreciation expense. The weighted average interest rates for the finance leases at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is 3.48% and 3.44%, respectively.
Other
The Company has historically generated cash flows from operations to fund a large portion of its capital expenditure requirements. The timing of capital expenditures can largely be managed around the seasonal working capital requirements of the Company. The Company believes it has adequate sources of capital to meet short-term liquidity needs through its operating cash flows and availability under its revolving credit agreement, which was $272.8 million at December 31, 2020, subject to the Company’s satisfaction of existing debt covenants. Future operating cash flows are primarily dependent upon the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage its working capital requirements, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and wage and benefit accruals. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants at December 31, 2020.
Net capital expenditures pertain primarily to investments in tractors and trailers and other revenue equipment, information technology, land and structures. Projected net capital expenditures for 2021 are approximately $275 million, inclusive of equipment acquired using finance leases. This compares to 2020 net capital expenditures of $219 million for property and equipment, inclusive of equipment acquired using finance leases. Projected 2021 capital expenditures include a normal replacement cycle of revenue equipment and technology investment for our operations. In addition, the Company plans to add revenue equipment and real estate investments to support our growth initiatives.
See “Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance and financial condition.
Actual net capital expenditures, inclusive of equipment acquired using finance leases, are summarized in the following table (in millions):
In addition to the amounts disclosed in the table above, the Company had an additional $16.3 million in capital expenditures for revenue equipment that was received but not paid for prior to December 31, 2020. In 2020, no revenue equipment was acquired with finance leases. Included in the 2019 and 2018 revenue equipment expenditures are finance leases totaling $6.2 million and $29.1 million, respectively.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, our operating leases with original maturities of less than one year are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet; however, the future minimum lease payments are included in the “Contractual Obligations” table below. See the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein. In the opinion of management, the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company include:
•
Claims and Insurance Accruals. As described in more detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein, the Company has self-insured retention limits generally ranging from $250,000 to $1 million per occurrence for medical, workers’ compensation, casualty and cargo claims and from $2 million to $10 million for auto liability. The liabilities are estimated in part based on historical experience, third-party actuarial analysis with respect to workers’ compensation claims, demographics, nature and severity, and other assumptions. The liabilities for self-funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers’ compensation claims and, with respect to all other liabilities, estimated based on management’s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience. However, these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of the Company differ from these assumptions. A significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle. These estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time; however, assumptions regarding severity of claims, medical cost inflation, as well as specific case facts can create short-term volatility in estimates.
•
Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances. Revenue is recognized over the transit time of the shipment as it moves from origin to destination while expenses are recognized as incurred. In addition, estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.
Revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up, day of delivery and current rates charged to customers. Since the cycle for pickup and delivery of shipments is generally 1-5 days, typically less than 5 percent of a total month’s revenue is in transit at the end of any month. Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses, adjustments processed and trends of collections. Billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections. These estimates are continuously evaluated and updated; however, changes in economic conditions, pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates.
•
Depreciation and Capitalization of Assets. Under the Company’s accounting policy for property and equipment, management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for the Company’s revenue equipment (tractors and trailers) based on their estimated useful lives and estimated residual values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in. These estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant. However, actual useful lives and residual values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors, thereby impacting the estimated amount or timing of depreciation expense.
These accounting policies and others are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.
