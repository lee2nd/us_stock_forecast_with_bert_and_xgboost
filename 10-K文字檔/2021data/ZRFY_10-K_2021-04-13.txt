ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
The following is management’s discussion and analysis (|MD&A”) of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements, as well as information relating to the plans of our current management. This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “continue,” and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this report or other reports or documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those projected. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Our MD&A is comprised of significant accounting estimates made in the normal course of its operations, overview of our business conditions, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources and contractual obligations. We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019 or 2020.
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (or “GAAP”). The preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Background
We are a software development and services company that offers a suite of integrated computer network security products using proprietary technology. Our ongoing strategy is developing and marketing our suite of network security products to the corporate, financial, healthcare, legal, government, technology, insurance, e-commerce and consumer sectors. We plan to continue to grow our business primarily through our expanding sales channel and internally generated sales, rather than by acquisitions. Apart from our 49% holding in BlockSafe Technologies, Inc., we have no other subsidiaries.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, and financial markets globally. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses. This outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products, and harm our business and results of operations. We cannot anticipate the effect that the impairments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or the degree to which the economy rebounds post-pandemic will have on our fiscal 2021 results, or the effectiveness and distributions of recently announced vaccines. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of COVID-19’s impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our results presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future years.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic did impact its operating results as sales to customers were down 73% as compared from the year ended December 31, 2019. However, we have not observed any impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of our assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business or results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
We have been following the recommendations of health authorities to minimize exposure risk for our team members, including the temporary closure of our corporate office and having team members work remotely. Most customers and vendors have transitioned to electronic submission of invoices and payments.
Management believes that cyber security is a growing requirement as the pandemic continues, more people are working remotely as well as using digital forms on a regular basis. Consequently, the market demand, in our estimation, is increasing. However, our company is also experiencing the impact of the pandemic. Currently our management is not working from our office location and impedes our ability to take full advantage of the increasing market demand. Many of our current clients have experienced a dramatic slowdown in their business, limiting their ability to have the resources to pay for our services. We still generate revenues and we anticipate, but cannot guarantee, we will have the resources to advance our video conferencing tool, SafeVchat™ and PrivacyLoK™, that provides authentication and encryption (using our existing products), for which we believe will have a great interest in the market. Currently, we have already earned revenues from SafeVchat™ and PrivacyLoK™ in 2021.
Our executive office is located at 1090 King Georges Post Road, Suite 603, Edison, NJ 08837. Our telephone number is (732) 661-9641. We have 9 employees. Our Company’s website is www.strikeforcetech.com (we are not including the information contained in our website as part of, nor should the information be relied upon or incorporated by reference into, this report on Form 10-K).
Results of Operations
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $207,000 compared to $768,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $561,000 or 73.1%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a reduction in the sales of our products with impairments related to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues are derived from software, key fobs and services.
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13,000 compared to $10,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $3,000, or 30.0%. The increase resulted from the increased fees related to certain revenues. Cost of revenues are fees and key fobs related to our revenues, and as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 6.2% compared to 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $520,000 compared to $520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The salaries, benefits and overhead costs of personnel conducting research and development of our software products primarily comprises our research and development expenses.
Compensation, professional fees, and selling, general and administrative (collectively, “SGA”) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2,350,000 compared to $1,839,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $511,000 or 27.8%. The increase was due primarily to an increase in employee stock-based compensation and professional fees. SG&A expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and overhead costs for executive and administrative personnel, insurance, fees for professional services, including consulting, legal, and accounting fees, plus travel costs and non-cash stock compensation expense for the issuance of stock options to employees and other general corporate expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense was $7,412,000 as compared to other expense of $2,147,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase in other expense of $5,265,000, or 245.2%. The increase was primarily due to increases in the loss on extinguishment of debt and in the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities, offset by decreases in private placement costs and in debt discount amortization.
Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10,088,000 compared to $3,750,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $6,338,000, or 169.0%. The increase was primarily due to increases in the loss on extinguishment of debt, in the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities, in employee stock-based compensation, in professional fees, and the decrease in revenues, offset by decreases in private placement costs and in debt discount amortization.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our total current assets at December 31, 2020 were $203,000, which included cash of $162,000, as compared with $99,000 in total current assets at December 31, 2019, which included cash of $75,000. Additionally, we had a stockholders’ deficit in the amount of $14,342,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to a stockholders’ deficit of $15,464,000 at December 31, 2019. We have historically incurred recurring losses and have financed our operations through loans, principally from affiliated parties such as our directors, and from the proceeds of debt and equity financing. We financed our operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily from the issuance of various debentures with proceeds of $1,495,000 which includes the receipt of the SBA-Payroll Protection Program loan funds of $313,000 and the SBA-Economic Injury Disaster Loan funds of $150,000. On November 13, 2020, our filing of an Offering Circular on Form 1-A, pursuant to Regulation A (File Number: 024-11267) was qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We registered 668,449,198 shares of common stock maximum proceeds of $2,315,000 (after deducting the maximum broker discount and costs of the offering). As of December 31, 2020, we sold subscriptions for $976,000 and issued 436,337,203 shares of our common stock to 27 investors relating to our November 2020 Offering Circular.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, convertible notes aggregating $45,000 of principal and $6,000 of accrued interest and fees were converted into 16,168,589 shares of common stock at conversion prices ranging from $0.00156 to $0.02 per share.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we issued 460,829 shares of common stock in exchange for the cancellation of accrued interest of $24,000 and the token financing obligation of $100,000.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we issued 34,139,772 shares of common stock upon a cashless exercise of 17,500,000 options shares and 17,045,454 warrants shares.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we issued 128,527 shares of common stock for services with a fair value of $26,000.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we issued 38,116,450 shares of its common stock to investors for cash proceeds of $1,525,000 pursuant to our November 2020 Offering Circular.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we repaid related party convertible notes, secured notes payable and accrued interest in the aggregate of $367,000.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we applied for funding pursuant to the Small Business Administration program. The second round of the Paycheck Protection Program provides forgivable funding for payroll and related costs as well as some non-payroll costs. We applied for funding and, to date, have received (on March 16, 2021) funding in the amount of $177,000.
Going Concern
We have yet to establish any history of profitable operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $10,088,000 and used cash in operating activities of $2,256,000, and at December 31, 2020, the Company had a stockholders’ deficit of $14,342,000. In addition, we are in default on notes payable and convertible notes payable in the aggregate amount of $3,604,000. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
At December 31, 2020, we had cash on hand in the amount of $162,000. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we sold subscriptions for $1,525,000 and issued 38,116,450 shares of its common stock in an offering under Regulation A and received one SBA Paycheck Protection assistance loan for $177,000. Management estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through the next six months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to continue to implement our business plan. Currently, management is attempting to increase revenues by selling through a channel of distributors, value added resellers, strategic partners and original equipment manufacturers. While we believe in the viability of its strategy to increase revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to increase our customer base and realize increased revenues. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, result of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include those related to accounting for financing obligations, assumptions used in valuing stock instruments issued for services, assumptions used in valuing derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and the accrual of potential liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.
The Company’s revenue consists of revenue from sales and support of our software products. Revenue primarily consists of sales of software licenses of our ProtectID®, GuardedID® and MobileTrust® products. We recognize revenue from these arrangements ratably over the contractual service period. For service contracts, the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied, and the related revenue is recognized, as services are rendered.
The Company offers no discounts, rebates, rights of return, or other allowances to clients which would result in the establishment of reserves against service revenue. Additionally, to date, the Company has not incurred incremental costs in obtaining a client contract.
Cost of revenue includes direct costs and fees related to the sale of our products.
Share-Based Payments
The Company periodically issues stock options, warrants, and shares of common stock as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for such grants issued and vesting based on FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) whereby the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation within its Statements of Operations with classification depending on the nature of the services rendered.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within its convertible debt to determine whether the embedded conversion features should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative. The fair value of the embedded derivatives are determined using Monte Carlo simulation method at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.
