Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Financial Condition
In FY21 operating activities used $85,000 cash, and the Company used $19,000 cash to acquire 130,000 shares of its common stock. In FY20 operating activities used $121,000 cash, and the Company used $4,000 cash to acquire 44,008 shares of its common stock. Consequently, cash balances decreased $104,000 in FY21 and $125,000 in FY20. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, accrued expenses, related party, of $1,073,000 consists of $1,024,000 in salary payable to the Company’s president, pursuant to his employment agreement, that the president has elected to defer, as well as $49,000 in related accrued payroll tax. The Company’s president may require the Company to pay the unpaid salary and payroll tax liability at any time.
The Company is likely to experience negative cash flow from operations unless and until the Company invests in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in another venture that produces sufficient cash flow from operations. With the exception of capital expenditures related to production acquisitions or drilling or recompletion activities or an investment in another venture that produces cash flow from operations, none of which are currently planned, the cash flows that could result from such acquisitions, activities, or investments, and the possibility of a material change in the current level of interest rates or of oil and gas prices, the Company knows of no trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Company's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. Except for cash generated by the operation of the Company's producing oil and gas properties, asset sales, and interest income, the Company has no internal or external sources of liquidity other than its working capital. At December 23, 2021, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures.
Results of Operations
Oil and gas sales increased from $31,000 in FY20 to $44,000 in FY21 because quantities sold and prices received increased in FY21. Interest income decreased from $17,000 in FY20 to nil in FY21 because of lower realized interest rates on cash balances. Included in other income in FY21 was $56,000 in out-of-period revenue that had been held in suspense.
At the current levels of net oil and gas production, cash balances, interest rates, and oil and gas prices, the Company’s revenue is unlikely to exceed its expenses. Unless and until the Company invests a substantial portion of its cash balances in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in one or more other ventures that produce revenue and net income, the Company is likely to experience net losses. With the exception of unanticipated ARO, unanticipated environmental expense, and possible changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices, the Company is not aware of any other trends, events, or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.
