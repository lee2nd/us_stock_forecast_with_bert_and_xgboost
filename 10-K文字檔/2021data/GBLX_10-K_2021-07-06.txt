Recent Developments
Sale of Membership Interest in GB Sciences Louisiana, LLC
On November 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Wellcana Plus, LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company ("Wellcana"), whereby Wellcana would acquire the Company’s 50.01% membership interest (the “Membership Interest”) in GB Sciences Louisiana LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company. Since entering into the agreement, certain modifications of the Agreement were made. It was ultimately agreed that Wellcana would pay the Company $4,900,000 in cash for the Membership Interest. On December 16, 2020, Wellcana made the final payment totaling $4,900,000 which completed the disposition of the Membership Interest.
Convertible Note Payable to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P.
On April 23, 2019, the Company issued an 8% Convertible Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the face amount of $2,765,000 to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. (“Iliad”). On April 22, 2020, the Company defaulted on its obligation to pay the Note by that date. Based upon the default, Iliad filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County, State of Utah (the “Court”). On July 14, 2020, the Court issued a judgment in favor of Iliad in the amount of $3,264,594 (the “Judgment”).
On November 20, 2020, the Company, Iliad, and Wellcana entered into the Judgment Settlement Agreement (the Agreement), in which the Company agreed to pay Iliad $3,006,015 on or before December 8, 2020, in full satisfaction of the Judgment. In addition to the Company and Iliad, the Agreement was signed by Wellcana Plus LLC (“Wellcana”). By signing the Agreement, Wellcana agreed to pay $3,006,015 of what it owed the Company, directly to Iliad to satisfy the Company’s obligation to Iliad. Of the $4,150,000 paid by Wellcana, $3,006,015 was sent directly by Wellcana to Iliad in satisfaction of the Company’s obligation pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.
Intellectual Property Portfolio
On October 14th, 2020, GB Sciences filed a provisional patent application to protect its machine learning algorithm for the prediction of novel active ingredients from traditional, plant-based medical preparations. The new provisional patent application is entitled “In Silico Meta-Pharmacopeia Assembly from Non-Western Medical Systems Using Advanced Data Analytic Techniques to Identify and Design Phytotherapeutic Strategies”. GBSGB’s proprietary data analytics tool uses in silico convergence analysis to deconvolve modes of action and predict desirable components of plant-based formulations established in traditional medical practice based on computational consensus analysis across cultures and medical systems.
On September 23rd, GB Sciences received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for claims protecting their Cannabinoid Containing Complex Mixtures (CCCMs) for the Treatment of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). The patent is owned by the Company’s Canadian entity, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. MCAS is a severe immunological condition in which mast cells inappropriately and excessively release inflammatory mediators, resulting in a range of severe chronic hyperinflammatory symptoms and life-threatening anaphylaxis attacks. There is no single recommended treatment for MCAS patients. Instead, patients, with their doctor’s guidance, attempt to manage MCAS symptoms primarily by avoiding ‘triggers’ and using rescue medicines for their severe hyperinflammatory attacks. Therefore, MCAS patients need new therapeutic options to control their mast cell related symptoms, and the Company’s CCCM™ were designed to simultaneously control multiple inflammatory pathways within mast cells as a comprehensive treatment option. The application, entitled “Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the Treatment of Mast Cell-Associated or Basophil-Mediated Inflammatory Disorders” was originally filed on January 31, 2018 and describes CCCMs that can be used for the treatment of Crohn's disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, allergic asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), psoriasis, eczema, urticarias, dermatitis, mastocytosis, or anaphylactic sting. Claims for these additional indications will be examined by the USPTO in the future. On December 8, 2020, the patent was issued as United States Patent 10,857,107.
On April 7th, 2020, GB Sciences received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for claims protecting Cannabinoid Containing Complex Mixtures ("CCCMs") for the Treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which is owned by the Company’s Canadian entity, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. On May 19, 2020, the patent was issued as United States Patent 10,653,640.
On May 12th, 2020, GB Sciences received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for claims protecting Myrcene Containing Complex Mixtures ("MCCMs") for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain. Intellectual property rights to this application and the MCCM contained within it are owned by the Company’s Canadian entity, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. The Company's MCCMs are protected for use in the treatment of pain related to arthritis, shingles, irritable bowel syndrome, sickle cell disease, and endometriosis. The patent was issued on July 14, 2020 as United States Patent 10,709,670.
Planned Divestiture of Nevada Cannabis Operations
On November 15, 2019, we entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (the "LOI") to sell the Company's membership interest interests in GBSN and GBLV (together, the "Teco Subsidiaries"). In connection with the LOI, we entered into a Management Agreement with the purchaser whereby the facilities will be managed by an affiliate of the purchaser until the close of the sale. On March 24, 2020, we entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Teco MIPA") which formalized the sale of the Teco Subsidiaries and modified the terms of the sale. Pursuant to the Teco MIPA, the Company will sell 100% of its membership interests in GBSN and GBLV for $4,000,000 cash upon close and $4,000,000 in the form of an 8% promissory note.
On November 27, 2019, we entered into a Binding Letter of Intent to sell the Company's 100% interest in GB Sciences Nopah, LLC. On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Nopah MIPA") and Promissory Note Modification Agreement with the purchaser of GB Sciences Nopah, LLC. The Company will receive $300,000 upon closing, and the purchaser will pay all expenses related to the upkeep and maintenance of the Nopah License from the date of the agreement. The $300,000 purchase price will be paid as a reduction to the balance of the 0% Note payable dated October 23, 2017, which is held by an affiliate of the purchaser of the Nopah license.
The sales of the Teco and Nopah Subsidiaries are expected to close upon the successful transfer of the Nevada cannabis cultivation and production licenses held by those subsidiaries. The transfer of cannabis licenses in the State of Nevada had been subject to an indefinite moratorium beginning in October 2019. In a meeting held on July 21, 2020, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board lifted the moratorium, however, the board has indicated that there were initially 90 requests pending, and it will take up to several months to process the entire backlog of pending license transfers. Based on this information, we cannot provide any assurances as to the timing of the close of the sale. In addition, the lifting of the moratorium and processing of cannabis license transfers have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and could be further delayed if the pandemic continues.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth certain of our Statement of Operations data from continuing operations:
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expense decreased $(3,739,897) to $2,001,617 for the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to $5,741,514 for the same period last year. The decrease is attributable to a company-wide initiative to reduce general and administrative costs, including a substantial reduction in the number of employees involved in administrative functions and related salaries & wages expense.
Gain/(Loss) on extinguishment. The gain on extinguishment of $467,872 for the year ended March 31, 2021 relates to the Judgment Settlement Agreement with Iliad Research & Trading, L.P. In order to settle the lawsuit brought by Iliad, the Company paid $3,006,014 in full satisfaction of the principal and accrued interest balance of $3,473,886. Prior year losses on extinguishment of $216,954 relate to modifications of the note payable to CSW Ventures, LP, which were accounted for as extinguishments.
Gain on settlement of accounts payable. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company settled accounts payable at a discount in exchange for immediate lump sum payments and recorded income from cancellation of accounts payable totaling $422,414, compared to $0 in the prior year.
Gain on deconsolidation. The Company recorded a gain on deconsolidation of $4,393,242 related to the sale of its 50% membership interest in GB Sciences Louisiana, LLC during the year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $0 in the current year.
Interest Expense. Interest for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $1,285,460, compared to $1,109,031 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to interest income of $509,265 related to the Wellcana note receivable included in the prior year amount as a net reduction, and offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the amortization of note discounts. Primarily as the result of the Company's largest outstanding notes payable becoming fully amortized during the year, interest expense from amortization of debt discounts decreased from $1,150,995 in the prior year to $776,122 in the current year.
Loss on modification of line of credit. As a result of the Omnibus Amendment dated December 29, 2020, the Company accrued a modification expense of $650,000. The amount represents an increase to the note balance to a total of $1,025,000, which will reduce the note receivable issued to the Company at the closing of the sale of the Teco Facility.
Loss on modification of note receivable. As the result of the Company's August 24, 2020 letter agreement with Wellcana, the Company determined that the amount of the note receivable from Wellcana that was collectible as of March 31, 2020 was $5,224,423 and recorded a loss on modification of note receivable in the amount of $1,895,434.
Debt default penalty. The Company recorded a default penalty of $286,059 related to the Company's failure to timely repay the principal and interest owed under the note payable to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. on April 1, 2020. The penalty is 10% of the principal and accrued interest balances outstanding at the time of default.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Current Liquidity
The Company will need additional capital to implement our strategies. There is no assurance that it will be able to raise the amount of capital needed for future growth plans. Even if financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable. If unable to raise the necessary capital at the times required, the Company may have to materially change the business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of the business plan or curtailing or abandoning the business plan. The Company represents a speculative investment and investors may lose all of their investment. In order to be able to achieve the strategic goals, the Company needs to further expand its business and financing activities. Based upon the cash position, it is necessary to raise additional capital by the end of the next quarter in order to continue to fund current operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is pursuing several alternatives to address this situation, including the raising of additional funding through equity or debt financings. In order to finance existing operations and pay current liabilities over the next twelve months, the Company will need to raise additional capital. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future.
The principal sources of liquidity to date have been cash generated from sales of debt and equity securities.
At March 31, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $793,040, other current assets excluding cash were $2,750,815, current assets from discontinued operations were $2,494,564, and our working capital deficit was $5,054,593, net of working capital of $439,979 from discontinued operations. Current liabilities were $8,598,448, which consisted principally of $3,594,804 in notes and convertible notes payable, $1,412,459 in accounts payable, $1,451,687 in accrued liabilities, and $2,054,585 current liabilities from discontinued operations. At March 31, 2020, the Company had a cash balance of $2,406, other current assets excluding cash were $6,998,474, current assets from discontinued operations were $1,755,275, and our working capital deficit was $3,884,877, including a working capital deficit of $243,787 from discontinued operations. Current liabilities were $10,885,757, which consisted principally of $5,054,728 in notes and convertible notes payable, $1,913,049 in accounts payable, $1,180,483 in accrued liabilities, and $1,999,062 from discontinued operations.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operating Activities
Cash used in operations was $2,185,220 including $118,644 used in discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2021, compared to cash used of $4,479,713 including $2,215,434 used in discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2020. We anticipate that cash flows from operations will be insufficient to fund business operations for the next twelve-month period. Accordingly, we will have to generate additional liquidity or cash flow to fund our current and anticipated operations. This will likely require the sale of additional common stock or other securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to realize any significant proceeds from such sales, if at all.
Investing Activities
Cash flows provided by investing activities were $4,655,519, net of $103,729 used in discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2021, compared to cash used in investing activities of $538,784 including $446,922 used in discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2020. Cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 relates to $5,051,923 proceeds of the Wellcana note receivable, offset by $292,675 used to pay our attorneys and researchers to draft and file patent applications. Cash used in prior year investing activities was used to pay our attorneys and researchers to draft and file patent applications.
Financing Activities
During the year ended March 31, 2021 cash used in financing activities was $1,476,432 including $161,768 used in discontinued operations. For the year ended March 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $4,988,208, including $741,655 provided by discontinued operations, respectively.
Cash flows from financing activities of continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 relate primarily to $3,156,014 used for principal payments of the note payable to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P., principal repayment of a related party note in the amount of $151,923, brokerage fees of $107,373, and debt issuance fees of $74,750, offset by $1,075,396 from warrant exercises, $725,000 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and $375,000 in proceeds from a line of credit.
Cash flows from financing activities of continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted of $790,225 proceeds from issuance of common stock, $1,274,790 from warrant exercises, and $2,630,000 proceeds from convertible notes, offset by $188,593 in brokerage fees, $175,000 in fees for convertible note issuances, and $84,869 of principal payments on debt and lease obligations.
Notes and Convertible Notes Payable
0% Note Payable dated October 23, 2017
On October 23, 2017, the Company amended the existing Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement (“Amended Production License Agreement”). Per the terms of the Amended Production License Agreement, GB Sciences purchased the remaining percentage of the production license resulting in the 100% ownership of the license. GB Sciences also received 100% ownership of the cultivation license included in the original Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement. In exchange, GB Sciences made one-time payment of $500,000 and issued a 0% Promissory Note in the amount of $700,000 payable in equal monthly payments over a three-year period commencing on January 1, 2018. The present value of the note was $521,067 on the date of its issuance based on an imputed interest rate of 20.3% and the Company recorded a discount on notes payable of $178,933 related to the difference between the face value and present value of the note.
To date, the Company has made principal payments totaling $330,555 and the principal balance of the note was $369,445 at March 31, 2021. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded interest expense of $13,929 related to amortization of the note discount. The remaining unamortized discount as of March 31, 2021 was $0.
On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Nopah MIPA") for the sale of its interest in GB Sciences Nopah, LLC. The Nopah MIPA will close upon successful transfer of the Nevada Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility Registration Certificate. Upon close, the principal balance of the note will be reduced to $190,272. The maturity date of the note was extended to July 31, 2021, with no payments of principal or interest due until maturity. In addition, the note will no longer bear interest at the penalty rate of 15% unless there is a new event of default.
8% Line of Credit dated November 27, 2019
In connection with the Binding Letter of Intent dated November 27, 2019, the Teco Subsidiaries entered into a promissory note and line of credit for up to $470,000 from the purchaser of the membership interests in the Teco Subsidiaries. The purpose of the line of credit is to supply working capital for the Teco Subsidiaries, and the note matures upon the close of the sale of the Teco Subsidiaries. The principal and accrued interest balances outstanding at the time of closing will be considered paid in full upon closing and will not reduce the purchase price received by GB Sciences. As of March 31, 2021, the Teco Subsidiaries have received $485,000 in advances under the line of credit, reflecting an informal agreement with the lender to increase the line of credit by $15,000. The Company accrued interest of $38,767 on the line of credit for the year ended March 31, 2021, and the balance of the line of credit was $485,000 at March 31, 2021. The note and related interest expense are included in current liabilities from discontinued operations and loss from discontinued operations.
8% Note Payable dated May 7, 2020
On May 7, 2020, the Company received $135,000 cash from an investor, net of $15,000 in brokerage fees, and issued a $150,000 promissory note. The note bears interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum. The note was to be repaid upon the first proceeds received from the $8,000,000 promissory note related to the sale of the Company's membership interest in GB Sciences Louisiana, LLC, or from the proceeds of the sale of the Teco Facility. As inducement to enter into the note transaction, the Company repriced 8,002,500 preexisting warrants held by the investor to an exercise price of $0.04. The repriced warrants were valued at $272,085 on the date of the transaction using the Black-Scholes Model, which exceeded the value of the warrants prior to the price reduction of $49,525 by $222,560. As the result of the increase in the estimated fair value of the warrants, the Company recorded a full discount on notes payable of $150,000. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded interest expense of $154,964 related to the note consisting of accrued interest of $4,964 and $150,000 related to amortization of the note discount. The Company paid $154,964 on October 5, 2020 in full satisfaction of the note.
8% Line of Credit dated July 24, 2020
On July 24, 2020, the Company entered into the Loan Agreement, 8% Secured Promissory Note, and Security Agreement (together, the "July 24 Note") with AJE Management, LLC, which established a revolving loan of up to $500,000 that the Company may draw on from time to time. The loan is collateralized by the Teco Facility, subject to the pre-existing lien held by CSW Ventures, L.P. in connection with the 8% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated February 28, 2019. Any advances will be made at the sole discretion of the lender following a written request made by the Company. Contemporaneously with the Loan Agreement, the Company and AJE Management entered into the Amendment to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with AJE Management. The amendment provides that any balances outstanding under the July 24 Note at the time of the close of the sale of the Teco Facility will be forgiven in exchange for a reduction to the $4,000,000 note receivable that the Company will receive as consideration for the sale of the Teco Facility. The reduction to the note receivable will be equal to 3 times the balance outstanding under the July 24 Note on the date of the close of the sale of the Teco Facility. The balance outstanding under the note plus accrued interest may be repaid at any time prior to the close of the sale of the Teco facility.
On December 29, 2020, the Company entered into the Omnibus Amendment with the purchaser of the Teco Facility. The Omnibus Amendment reduces the amount of the note receivable that the Company will receive from the sale of the Teco Facility by $975,000 (three times $325,000 in advances made under the July 24 Note) to $3,025,000. Any advances made to the Company under the July 24 Note in excess of $325,000 will reduce the amount of cash received upon close of the sale of Teco one-for-one, i.e. such advances will be considered advance payments of the $4,000,000 cash purchase price. The Company also agreed that it will not repay the balances outstanding under the July 24 Note prior to the closing of the Teco sale. As a result of the Omnibus Amendment, the Company accrued a modification expense of $650,000 (two times $325,000 in addition to $325,000 in advances already recorded under the July 24 Note). The Company has received $50,000 in additional advances above $325,000 bringing the total balance to $1,025,000 at March 31, 2021. Interest expense was $12,510 for the year ended March 31, 2021.
March 2017 and July 2017 Convertible Note Offerings
In March 2017, the Company entered into a Placement Agent’s Agreement with a third-party brokerage firm to offer units consisting of a $1,000 6% promissory note convertible into 4,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.25 per share and 4,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s’ common stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share for the period of three years. Between March 2017 and May 2017, the Company issued short-term Promissory Notes (“Notes”) to various holders with combined face value of $2,000,000. The Notes are payable within three years of issuance and are convertible into 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also issued 8,000,000 common stock warrants to the Noteholders. The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each warrant gives the Noteholder the right to purchase one share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.60 per share for a period of three years. The Company recorded an aggregate discount on convertible notes of $1,933,693, which included $904,690 related to the relative fair value of beneficial conversion features and $1,029,003 for the relative fair value of the warrants issued with each note. The fair value of warrants was derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
In July 2017, the Company entered into a Placement Agent’s Agreement with a third-party brokerage firm to offer units consisting of a $1,000 6% promissory note convertible into 4,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.25 per share and 4,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s’ common stock at an exercise price of $0.65 per share for the period of three years. Between July 2017 and December 2017, the Company issued short-term Promissory Notes (“Notes”) to various holders with combined face value of $7,201,000. The Notes are payable within three years of issuance and are convertible into 28,804,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also issued 28,804,000 common stock warrants to the Noteholders. The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each warrant gives the Noteholder the right to purchase one share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.60 per share for a period of three years. The Company recorded an aggregate discount on convertible notes of $7,092,796, which included $3,142,605 related to the relative fair value of beneficial conversion features and $3,950,191 for the relative fair value of the warrants issued with each note. The fair value of warrants was derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
All notes from the March and July 2017 offerings have passed their maturity dates. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company agreed to extensions with the holders of a total of $197,000 of the $1,257,000 that remains outstanding. For the $197,000 of extended notes, the Company agreed to reduce the conversion price to $0.10 per share and issued a total of 788,000 additional warrants to the holders of the notes with a term of three years and an exercise price of $0.10 per share. In exchange, the maturity date of the notes was extended to September 30, 2023. Using the Black-Scholes model, the Company valued the warrants at $13,396 and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature at $33,490. Because the change in the fair value of the conversion feature exceeded 10% of the carrying amount of the notes, the Company accounted for the modification of the notes as an extinguishment and recorded a discount on the new convertible notes of $46,886 related to the fair value of the new warrants issued and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature. The Company recorded interest expense of $28,306 on the new notes during the year ended March 31, 2021, of which $22,412 represented amortization of the note discounts. Accrued interest on the $197,000 extended notes is $44,332 at March 31, 2021, which includes $38,438 accrued prior to the extinguishments.
Three convertible notes totaling $1,060,000 held by the same investor are past maturity and are currently in default. The Company is negotiating the terms of an extension with the note holder. The notes do not provide for a default penalty or penalty interest rate. Interest expense during the year ended March 31, 2021, was $208,779, of which $139,253 represents amortization of the note discount. Accrued interest on the $1,060,000 notes was $228,373 at March 31, 2021.
8% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated February 28, 2019
On February 28, 2019, the Company issued a $1,500,000 8% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note and entered into the Note Purchase Agreement and Security Agreement with CSW Ventures, L.P. (together, “CSW Note”). The note matured on August 28, 2020 and was convertible at any time until maturity into 8,823,529 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.17 per share. Collateral pledged as security for the note includes all of the Company’s 100% membership interests in GB Sciences, Nevada, LLC and GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, which together represent substantially all of the Company’s cannabis cultivation and production operations and assets located at the Teco facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature resulting from the market price of the Company’s common stock in excess of the conversion price was $176,471 on the date of issuance, and the Company recorded a discount on the CSW Note in that amount.
On May 28, 2019, the Company received notice from CSW Ventures, L.P. of the conversion of a total of $170,000 of the principal balance of the 8% Senior Secured Promissory Note dated February 28, 2019. Accordingly, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock based on a $0.17 per share conversion price. In connection with the conversions, $17,225 in unamortized discount was recorded as interest expense and the Company reduced the carrying amount of convertible notes payable by $152,775. After conversion, the remaining balance outstanding was $1,330,000.
On July 12, 2019, the Company entered into the Amendment to Note Documents and the Amended and Restated 8% Senior Secured Promissory Note (together, “Amended CSW Note”). The Amended CSW Note increased the note balance by $100,000 to reflect an additional $100,000 advanced to the Company on July 12, 2019 and by $41,863 to add accrued interest to date to the principal balance, and decreased the conversion price to $0.11 per share, with the remaining terms substantially unchanged from the original CSW Note.
The Company evaluated the modification under the guidance in ASC 470-50 and determined that the amendment represents an extinguishment because the change in the fair value of the conversion feature exceeded 10% of the carrying value of the CSW Note on the amendment date. The carrying value of the amended note on the date of extinguishment was $1,338,057, net of a beneficial conversion feature discount of $133,806, and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $124,158.
On August 1, 2019, the Company received notice from CSW Ventures, L.P. of the conversion of a total of $110,000 of the principal balance of the Amended CSW Note at $0.11 per share. Accordingly, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock. In connection with the conversions, $9,579 in unamortized discount was recorded as interest expense and the Company has reduced the carrying amount of convertible notes payable by $100,421. After conversion, the remaining balance outstanding was $1,361,863.
On October 23, 2019, the Company entered into the Amendment to Promissory Note. The October 23, 2019 amendment decreased the conversion price to $0.08 per share, with the remaining terms substantially unchanged from the Amended CSW Note.
We evaluated the modification under the guidance in ASC 470-50 and determined that the amendment represents an extinguishment because the change in the fair value of the conversion feature exceeded 10% of the carrying value of the Amended CSW Note immediately prior to the 2nd Amended CSW Note. The carrying value of the Amended CSW Note on the date of extinguishment was $1,269,067, net of a beneficial conversion feature discount of $92,796, and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $92,796 during the year ended March 31, 2020.
On November 27, 2019, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Note Documents and the Second Amended and Restated 8% Senior Secured Promissory Note (together, “2nd Amended CSW Note”). The 2nd Amended CSW Note decreased the conversion price to $0.04 per share and increased the note balance by $30,000 to reflect an advance received on that date, with the remaining terms substantially unchanged from the Amended CSW Note.
We evaluated the modification under the guidance in ASC 470-50 and determined that the 2nd Amended CSW Note represents an extinguishment because the change in the fair value of the conversion feature exceeded 10% of the carrying value of the Amended CSW Note immediately prior to the 2nd Amended CSW Note; however, no loss on extinguishment was recorded because the net consideration paid for the 2nd Amended CSW Note was equal to the extinguished carrying value of the Amended CSW Note. The carrying value of the Amended CSW Note on the date of extinguishment was $1,361,863.
On December 16, 2019, the Company received notice from CSW Ventures, L.P. of the conversion of a total of $120,000 of the principal balance of the Amended CSW Note at $0.04 per share and we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock. In connection with the conversions, $57,551 in unamortized discount was recorded as interest expense, and the Company has reduced the carrying amount of convertible notes payable by $62,449. After conversion, the remaining balance outstanding was $1,271,863 and the carrying amount of the note was $687,021, net of $584,842 in unamortized discount from the beneficial conversion feature.
On December 29, 2020, the Company entered into the Omnibus Amendment, and the note holder agreed to cease interest accrual on the CSW Note after November 30, 2020.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Company received notice of the conversion of $160,000 total principal balance at $0.04 per share and issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock to the note holder. After the conversions, the remaining principal balance and carrying amount of the note is $1,111,863 as of March 31, 2021.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, we recorded interest expense of $477,500 related to the CSW Note and its amendments consisting of $68,019 in stated interest and $409,481 related to amortization of the note discount. The total outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest totaling $1,256,857 will reduce the $4,000,000 cash payment received by the Company upon the close of the sale of the Teco Facility, and no further interest expense will be accrued on the note.
8% Convertible Promissory Note dated April 23, 2019
On April 23, 2019, the Company entered into the Note Purchase Agreement with Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. ("Iliad") and issued an 8% Convertible Promissory Note with a face value of $2,765,000. The Note was issued with original issue discount of $265,000 and is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.17 per share at the option of the note holder at any time until the Note is repaid. The Note matured on April 22, 2020. A total discount of $440,000 was recorded on the note, which includes $265,000 of original issue discount and $175,000 in fees paid to brokers.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company honored the conversion of a total of a total of $125,000 of accrued interest on the Iliad Note at reduced conversion rates. On October 30, 2019, the Company received notice of the conversion of $75,000 at $0.06 per share and issued 1,250,000 shares of its common stock. The fair value of the shares issued exceeded the fair value of the shares issuable under the original terms of the Note by $64,706, and the Company recorded an induced conversion expense. On November 18, 2019, the Company received notice of the conversion of $50,000 of the note balance at $0.0375 per share and issued 1,333,333 shares of its common stock.
On April 22, 2020, the Company failed to make payment of the principal and accrued interest due under the Iliad Note, resulting in a default. Upon the occurrence of the default, the principal and accrued interest balances outstanding increased by 10%. As the result of the default, Company recorded an expense of $9,559 related to a 10% increase in the accrued interest balance, which is recorded in interest expense, and $276,500 related to the 10% increase in the principal balance, which is recorded in debt default penalty and other expense.
On May 20, 2020, Iliad filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County in the State of Utah demanding repayment of the note. The lawsuit further sought to compel the Company to participate in arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions contained within the Note Purchase Agreement and to prohibit the Company to raise funds through the issuance of its common stock unless the note is paid in full simultaneously with such issuance. On July 14, 2020, the Court entered judgment in favor of Iliad in the amount of $3,264,594 plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs and accrued post-judgment interest at the default rate of 15% per annum.
On November 20, 2020, the Company, Iliad, and Wellcana Plus, LLC entered into the Judgment Settlement Agreement, whereby Iliad agreed to discharge all amounts owed to it by the Company upon receipt of payment totaling $3,006,014 directly from the proceeds of the Wellcana Note Receivable on or before December 8, 2020. On December 8, 2020, Wellcana failed to make payment to the Company. On December 9, 2020, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Iliad extending the Judgment Settlement agreement in exchange for payment of $25,000 plus $25,000 per week until the payment totaling $3,006,014 is received by Iliad, with such payments not reducing the amount owed under the Judgment Settlement Agreement. On December 16, 2020, Wellcana made payment of the full amount owed to the Company, of which $3,006,014 was paid directly to Iliad in full satisfaction of the Judgment Settlement Agreement. On December 18, 2020, Iliad filed a Satisfaction of Judgment in the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County in the State of Utah, and the lawsuit was dismissed. The Company has no further obligations to Iliad.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, interest expense related to the Iliad Note was $379,956, of which $29,831 relates to amortization of the note discount, $140,833 relates to accrued interest prior to the judgment, and $209,292 was accrued post-judgment interest. The Company also recorded $25,000 in other expense as the result of the letter agreement to extend the Judgment Settlement Agreement. As of the date of final payment, the outstanding judgment balance of $3,264,594 plus accrued post-judgment interest of $209,292 totaled $3,473,886, and the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of $467,872.
Variables and Trends
We have limited operating history with respect to the current business plan. In the event we are able to obtain the necessary financing to move forward with the business plan, we expect business expenses to increase significantly as we go operational. Accordingly, the comparison of the financial data for the periods presented may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance and must be considered in light these circumstances.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, valuation of initial right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, valuation of beneficial conversion features in convertible debt, valuation of the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, stock-based compensation expense, purchased intangible asset valuations, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, litigation and other loss contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results the Company experiences may differ materially and adversely from these estimates.
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations comprise those activities that were disposed of during the period or which were classified as held for sale at the end of the period and represent a separate major line of business or geographical area that can be clearly distinguished for operational and financial reporting purposes. The Company has included its subsidiaries GB Sciences Louisiana, LLC, GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, and GB Sciences Nopah, LLC in discontinued operations due to the sale of the Company's Louisiana cultivation and extraction facility and the pending sale of the Company's Nevada cultivation and extraction facilities.
Inventory
We value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory, as determined using the first-in, first-out method, or its current estimated market value. We periodically review our physical inventory for excess, obsolete, and potentially impaired items and reserve accordingly. Our reserve estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is based on expected future use. Indirect costs, which primarily relate to the lease and operation costs of the Teco Facility, are allocated based on square footage of the facility used in the production of inventory.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent the value of our patents pending and includes the costs paid to draft and file patent applications. Upon issuance of the patents, the indefinite-lived intangible assets will have finite lives. Intangible assets also include the acquisition cost of a cannabis production license with an indefinite life. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and we periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Teco MIPA") to sell 100% of the membership interests in the Teco Facility. As a result of this agreement, the Company determined that the long-lived assets of the Teco Facility including a production license acquired through purchase might be impaired due to the current expectation that the asset group will more likely than not be disposed of by sale significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $449,801 related to the license for the year ended March 31, 2020, and reduced the carrying value of the related intangible asset from $1,021,067 to $571,264. The license asset and the impairment loss are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment if impairment indicators are present or if other circumstances indicate that impairment may exist under authoritative guidance. The annual testing date is March 31. When management believes impairment indicators may exist, projections of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of and eventual disposition of property and equipment are prepared. If the projections indicate that the carrying value of the property and equipment are not recoverable, we reduce the carrying values to fair value. These impairment tests are heavily influenced by assumptions and estimates that are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Teco MIPA") to sell 100% of the membership interests in the Teco Facility. As a result of this agreement, the Company determined that the long-lived assets of the Teco Facility might be impaired due to the current expectation that the asset group will more likely than not be disposed of by sale significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The Company estimated future undiscounted cash flows related to the Teco Facility to be $8.0 million, which was less than the carrying amount of the Teco Facility asset group of $11.9 million. Using a discounted cash flow approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the asset group to be approximately $7.3 million, resulting in a write-down of $4,645,054 related to the Teco Facility asset group. Fair value was based on expected future cash flows using level 3 inputs under ASC 820. The cash flows are the proceeds expected to be generated from the sale of the assets under the Teco MIPA, discounted to present value at a rate of 17%. The impairment loss and the related long-lived assets are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
Beneficial Conversion Feature of Convertible Notes Payable
The Company accounts for convertible notes payable in accordance with the guidelines established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 00-27, “Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments”. A beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after first considering the allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of any attached equity instruments, if any related equity instruments were granted with the debt. In accordance with this guidance, the BCF of a convertible note is measured by allocating a portion of the note's proceeds to the warrants, if applicable, and as a reduction of the carrying amount of the convertible note equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion feature, both of which are credited to additional paid-in-capital. The Company calculates the fair value of warrants issued with the convertible notes using the Black-Scholes valuation model and uses the same assumptions for valuing any employee options in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation. The only difference is that the contractual life of the warrants is used.
The value of the proceeds received from a convertible note is then allocated between the conversion features and warrants on a relative fair value basis. The allocated fair value is recorded in the financial statements as a debt discount (premium) from the face amount of the note and such discount is amortized over the expected term of the convertible note (or to the conversion date of the note, if sooner) and is charged to interest expense.
Equity-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718) and Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees pursuant to ASC 505-50 (ASC 505-50). The computation of the expense associated with stock-based compensation requires the use of a valuation model. The FASB-issued accounting guidance requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, and expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation. We currently use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options. We primarily use historical data to determine the assumptions to be used in the Black-Scholes model and have no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ materially from historical data. However, changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility and future stock award exercise experience could result in a change in the assumptions used to value awards in the future and may result in a material change to the fair value calculation of stock-based awards. This accounting guidance requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income. Although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, significant unanticipated changes in those estimates, interpretations and assumptions may result in recording stock option expense that may materially impact our financial statements for each respective reporting period.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax items are reflected at the enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to the uncertainty regarding the success of future operations, management has valued the deferred tax asset allowance at 100% of the related deferred tax assets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Standards
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. The standard is effective for all entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard on April 1, 2020 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Standards Not Yet Adopted
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This guidance clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options due to a lack of explicit guidance in the FASB Codification. The ASU 2021-04 is effective for The Company's fiscal year beginning April 1, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2021-04 on its consolidated financial statements.
On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard requires the use of an “expected loss” model on certain types of financial instruments. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and requires estimated credit losses to be recorded as allowances instead of reductions to amortized cost of the securities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning April 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its financial statements.
In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. The guidance simplifies the current guidance for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Additionally, the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. This ASU will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning April 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update must be applied on either full retrospective basis or modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as well as the timing of adoption.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
