Overview
Who We Are and How We Generate Income
Dime Community Bancshares, Inc., a New York corporation previously known as “Bridge Bancorp, Inc.,” is a bank holding company formed in 1989. On a parent-only basis, the Holding Company has had minimal results of operations. The Holding Company is dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dime Community Bank, which was previously known as “BNB Bank,” its own earnings, additional capital raised, and borrowings as sources of funds. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank's results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant credit and debit card processing programs, loan swap fees, investment services, income from its title insurance subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses,
Page -23-
expenses from the Bank’s title insurance subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects our net income. We believe the Merger created the opportunity for the resulting company to leverage complementary and diversified revenue streams and to potentially have superior future earnings and prospects compared to our current earnings and prospects on a stand-alone basis. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts and the related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders' equity.

Challenges and Opportunities
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel and employee work locations, as many employees are working remotely. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers, such as waiving late payment and other fees. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the challenges our business will face and the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business.
We continue to face challenges associated with ever-increasing banking regulations and the current low interest rate environment. A prolonged inverted or flat yield curve presents a challenge to a bank, like us, that derives most of its revenue from net interest margin. A sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. When interest rates decline, borrowers tend to refinance higher-rate, fixed-rate loans at lower rates. In addition, the majority of our loans are at variable interest rates, which would adjust to lower rates. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve has reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25% during the 2020 first quarter. We took this opportunity to lower our funding costs and stabilize our net interest margin.

We established five strategic objectives to achieve our vision: (1) acquire new customers in growth markets; (2) build new sales and marketing disciplines; (3) deepen customer relationships; (4) expand use of automation; and (5) improve talent management. We believe there remain opportunities to grow our franchise and that continued investments to generate core funding, quality loans and new sources of revenue remain keys to continue creating long-term shareholder value. Our ability to attract, retain, train and cultivate employees at all levels of our Company remains significant to meeting our corporate objectives. In particular, we are focused on expanding and retaining our loan team as we continue to grow the loan portfolio. We have capitalized on opportunities presented by the market and diligently seek opportunities to grow and strengthen the franchise. We recognize the potential risks of the current economic environment and will monitor the impact of market events as we evaluate loans and investments and consider growth initiatives. Our management and Board of Directors have built a solid foundation for growth, and we are positioned to adapt to anticipated changes in the industry resulting from new regulations and legislative initiatives.
Paycheck Protection Program
We are an active participant in the SBA PPP for small business customers. As of December 31, 2020, we originated over 4,200 loans totaling approximately $980 million. The top industries were construction, professional, manufacturing, health care, accommodation/food, and administrative. The mean and median PPP loan amounts were $229 thousand and $70 thousand, respectively.
The following table presents the outstanding balance and range of loan size of our PPP loans as of December 31, 2020:
Substantially all of the PPP loans we originated have a two-year term and a 1% interest rate. Subsequent CARES Act changes extended the maturities of these loans to potentially five years at the borrower’s option. Any changes are expected to be made at the end of the interest only phase and are expected to coincide with the forgiveness process. The SBA pays us fees ranging from 1% to 5% per loan depending on the loan principal amount. Fee income from processing PPP loans is amortized as a yield adjustment over the life of the loan. PPP loans are expected to be fully guaranteed by the SBA.
Prior to the commencement of the PPP program, in the 2020 first quarter we funded 80 loans totaling $4.2 million with an average loan size of $53 thousand. These streamlined loans were our initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic to quickly provide customers with small loans to bridge short term cash flow. We terminated this program and focused our efforts on developing a process to accept PPP loans when the PPP program commenced on April 3, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $3.2 million of these loans remain outstanding.
COVID-19 Loan Moratoriums and Forbearance Programs
We are supporting our customers who may experience financial difficulty due to COVID-19 through loan moratoriums and forbearance programs. We began offering 90-day payment modifications on a case-by-case basis to those customers whose income was adversely impacted by COVID-19. The loan modifications in this program primarily consist of three-month deferrals of interest and principal payments. Extensions may be granted on a case by case basis. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 500 loans totaling $635 million were granted payment moratoriums during 2020. These deferrals are not considered TDRs based on the CARES Act and/or the interagency guidance. As of January 21, 2021, $76.1 million in moratoriums were outstanding.
The industries we identified as most significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic based on the potential risk to cash flows are hotels, restaurants, passenger transportation, leisure, museums and catering.

Community Support
We continue to support our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic by pledging a total of $1.8 million to support COVID-19 affected communities, including $500 thousand in grants to non-profit partners working on the COVID-19 relief effort in our footprint. These grants are focused on organizations working to address meeting the basic needs of the vulnerable populations, providing emergency food, and health services. We have partnered with local governments to help coordinate emergency relief. The PPP loans we funded also benefitted hundreds of non-profit partners. A portion of the fees generated by the PPP will be set aside to increase funding for local organizations.
Significant Events
Merger Agreement with Dime Community Bancshares, Inc.
On July 1, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Legacy Dime. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on February 1, 2021, Legacy Dime merged with and into Bridge, with Bridge as the surviving corporation under the name “Dime Community Bancshares, Inc.”
At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Legacy Dime common stock, par value $0.01 per share, was converted into the right to receive 0.6480 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share.
At the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Dime Preferred Stock was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of Company preferred stock having the same powers, preferences and rights as the Dime Preferred Stock.
Immediately following the Merger, Dime Community Bank, a New York-chartered commercial bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Legacy Dime, merged with and into BNB Bank, a New York-chartered commercial bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with BNB Bank as the surviving bank, under the name “Dime Community Bank.”
In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Debentures due 2027 of Legacy Dime.
Critical Accounting Policies
Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Our policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses is our most critical accounting policy. This policy is important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations, and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition.
The following is a description of this critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its application.
Allowance for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2020, we adopted the current expected credit loss model (“CECL” or the “CECL Standard”), which requires that loans held for investment be accounted for under the current expected credit losses model. Although the CARES Act provided the option to delay the adoption of the current expected credit loss model until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the termination of the current national emergency declaration related to the COVID-19 outbreak, we implemented the CECL Standard in the first quarter of 2020 as previously planned. The allowance for credit losses is established and maintained through a provision for credit losses based on expected losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis. Management monitors its entire loan portfolio regularly, with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans, repayment patterns, past loss experience, various types of
Page -26-
concentrations of credit, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged against the allowance.
The credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan risk ratings, the level at which credit risk is monitored. When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on expected loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and provision for credit losses in those future periods.
Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in our process for estimation of expected credit losses. The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan risk rating migration, historic loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components: (1) an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and (2) a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics.
Loans that do not share similar credit risk characteristics
For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, expected credit loss is measured based on net realizable value, that is, the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, based on the original effective interest rate, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. For these loans, we recognize expected credit loss equal to the amount by which the net realizable value of the loan is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan (which is net of previous charge-offs), except when the loan is collateral dependent, that is, when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In these cases, expected credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is adjusted for the estimated costs to sell the loan if repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on the sale (rather than only on the operation) of the collateral.
The fair value of real estate collateral is determined based on recent appraised values. Appraisals are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by us. All appraisals undergo a second review process to ensure that the methodology employed and the values derived are reasonable. Generally, collateral values for real estate loans for which measurement of expected losses is dependent on collateral values are updated every twelve months. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the borrower and its business. Once the expected credit loss amount is determined, an allowance is provided for equal to the calculated expected credit loss and included in the allowance for credit losses. Pursuant to our policy, credit losses must be charged-off in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectable.
Loans that share similar credit risk characteristics
In estimating the component of the allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics with other loans, such loans are segmented into loan types. Loans are designated into loan pools with similar risk characteristics based on product type in conjunction with other homogeneous characteristics. Loan types include commercial real estate mortgages, owner and non-owner occupied; multi-family mortgage loans; residential real estate mortgages and home equity loans; commercial, industrial and agricultural loans, real estate construction and land loans; and consumer loans.
In determining the allowance for credit losses, we derive an estimated credit loss assumption from a model that categorizes loan pools based on loan type and further segmented by risk rating. This model is known as Probability of Default/Loss Given Default, utilizing a Transition Matrix approach. This model calculates an expected loss percentage for each loan
Page -27-
pool by considering the probability of default, based upon the historical transition or migration of loans from performing (various pass ratings) to criticized, and classified risk ratings to default by risk rating buckets using life-of-loan analysis runout periods for all loan segments, and the historical severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses (loss given default) per loan pool. The default trigger, which is defined as the earlier of ninety days past-due or non-accrual status, and severity factors used to calculate the allowance for credit losses for loans in pools that share similar risk characteristics with other loans, are adjusted for differences between the historical period used to calculate historical default and loss severity rates and expected conditions over the remaining lives of the loans in the portfolio. These factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures; (2) international, national, regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various markets; (3) the nature and volume of the loan portfolio including the terms of the loans; (4) the experience, ability, and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; (5) the volume and severity of past due and adversely classified or graded loans and the volume of non-accrual loans; (6) the quality of our loan review system; (7) the value of underlying collateral for collateralized loans; (8) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (9) the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio. Such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss for current conditions that are not reflective of the model results. In addition, the economic factor includes management’s expectation of future conditions based on a reasonable and supportable forecast of the economy. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made (currently two years), the Bank immediately reverts back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss. Management believes that this transition approach to the Probability of Default/Loss Given Default is a relevant calculation of expected credit losses as there is sufficient volume as well as movement in the risk ratings due to the initial grading system as well as timely updates to risk ratings when necessary. Credit risk ratings are based on management’s evaluation of a credit’s cash flow, collateral, guarantor support, financial disclosures, industry trends and strength of borrowers’ management.
The adequacy of the allowance is analyzed quarterly, with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the Credit Risk Management Committee (“CRMC”), based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio. Each quarter, members of the CRMC meet with the Credit Risk Committee of our Board of Directors to review credit risk trends and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Based on the CRMC’s review of the classified loans, delinquency and charge-off trends, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the overall allowance levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we believe the allowance for credit losses has been established at levels sufficient to cover the expected losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic, market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination.
For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Income
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $42.0 million and $2.11 per diluted share as compared to $51.7 million and $2.59 per diluted share for the same period in 2019. Changes in net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 include: (i) an $18.6 million, or 13.1%, increase in net interest income; (ii) a $5.8 million, or 101.8%, increase in the provision for credit losses; (iii) a $5.7 million, or 22.4%, decrease in non-interest
Page -28-
income; (iv) a $17.1 million, or 17.8%, increase in non-interest expense; and (v) a $0.4 million, or 2.7%, decrease in income tax expense.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the primary contributor to earnings, represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expenses on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them.
The following table presents certain information relating to our average consolidated balance sheets and our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for those periods on a tax-equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from daily average balances and include non-accrual loans. The yields and costs include fees and costs, which are considered adjustments to yields. Interest on non-accrual loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of income. For purposes of this table, the average balances for investments in debt and equity securities exclude unrealized appreciation/depreciation due to the application of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities”.

(1) Amounts are net of deferred origination costs/(fees) and allowance for credit losses, and include loans held for sale.
(2) Presented on a tax-equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%.
(3) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.
(4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
Page -30-
Rate/Volume Analysis
Net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes. The following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rates (changes in rates multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net changes. For purposes of this table, changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate. Due to the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the periods analyzed, it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates. In addition, average interest-earning assets include non-accrual loans.
(1) Amounts are net of deferred origination costs/(fees) and allowance for credit losses, and include loans held for sale.
(2) Presented on a tax-equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%.
Net interest income increased $18.6 million, or 13.1%, to $160.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $142.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average net interest-earning assets increased $637.7 million to $2.2 billion for 2020 compared to $1.5 billion for 2019. The increase in average net interest-earning assets was primarily driven by loan growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio, and a rise in deposits with banks, partially offset by increases in average deposits and average borrowings, and a decrease in average investment securities. Tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.99% in 2020 compared to 3.31% in 2019. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest margin for 2020 compared to 2019 reflects the lower average yield on our loan portfolio and significantly higher levels of cash earning low average yields, partially offset by lower overall funding costs, due in part to federal funds rate decreases during the third and fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve has reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25% during the 2020 first quarter. We took this opportunity to lower our funding costs and stabilize our net interest margin.
Total interest income increased $2.7 million, or 1.5%, to $184.2 million in 2020 compared to $181.5 million in 2019 as average interest-earning assets increased $1.1 billion, or 25.0%, to $5.4 billion in 2020 compared to $4.3 billion in 2019. The increase in average interest-earning assets in 2020 compared to 2019 reflects growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio driven by PPP loan originations, and a rise in deposits with banks driven by deposit growth, partially offset by a
Page -31-
decrease in average investment securities. The decline in economic activity during the COVID-19 shut-down resulted in more of our customers increasing their deposits, which raised our average deposits with banks in the current year. The tax-equivalent average yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 3.43% in 2020 compared to 4.22% in 2019. The PPP loans and excess liquidity in banks had the effect of depressing our net interest margin in the current year.
Interest income on loans increased to $169.4 million for 2020 compared to $158.2 million for 2019, primarily due to growth in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in yield on loans. Average loans grew by $930.9 million, or 21.4%, to $4.3 billion in 2020 compared to $3.4 billion in 2019. The tax-equivalent average yield on loans was 3.91% in 2020 compared to 4.65% in 2019. The PPP loans had the effect of decreasing the tax-equivalent yield by 17 basis points in 2020.
Interest income on investment securities decreased to $14.1 million in 2020 from $21.6 million in 2019. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 reflects a decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a lower average yield on investment securities. Interest income on investment securities included net amortization of premiums on securities of $3.6 million in 2020, compared to $4.4 million in 2019. Average total investment securities decreased by $180.8 million, or 22.0%, to $642.5 million in 2020 compared to $823.3 million in 2019. The decline in tax-equivalent average yield on total investment securities to 2.23% in 2020 compared to 2.66% in 2019 reflected the impact of the reductions in the benchmark federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in the third and fourth quarter of 2019, and the first quarter of 2020, and the related decline in market interest rates available on securities purchases.
Total interest expense decreased $15.9 million, or 40.4%, to $23.5 million in 2020 compared to $39.3 million in 2019. The decrease in interest expense between periods was a result of the decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in average deposits and average borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.73% in 2020 compared to 1.42% in 2019. The decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities is primarily due to federal funds rate decreases during the third and fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased to $3.2 billion in 2020 compared to $2.8 billion in 2019 due to an increase in average deposits and average borrowings.
Average total deposits increased to $4.9 billion in 2020 compared to $3.8 billion in 2019 primarily due to increases in average demand deposits, and average savings, NOW and money market deposits. Average demand deposits increased to $2.0 billion in 2020 compared to $1.4 billion in 2019. The increase in demand deposits was primarily driven by an inflow of deposits from PPP loan customers in 2020. The average balances in savings, NOW and money market accounts increased to $2.5 billion in 2020 compared to $2.1 billion in 2019. Average certificates of deposit increased $16.1 million to $303.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The average cost of savings, NOW and money market accounts decreased to 0.41% in 2020 compared to 1.12% in 2019. The average cost of certificates of deposit decreased to 1.50% in 2020 compared to 2.01% in 2019. Average public fund deposits increased to 17.5% of total average deposits during 2020 compared to 15.2% in 2019.
Average federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements declined to $8.6 million in 2020 compared to $41.1 million in 2019. The cost of average federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements was 0.92% in 2020, compared to 1.87% for the same period in 2019. Average FHLB advances increased to $284.7 million in 2020, compared to $245.3 million in 2019. Average subordinated debentures increased to $79.0 million in 2020, compared to $78.8 million in 2019.
Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses
At December 31, 2020, our loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in our principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs. The interest rates we charge on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by our competitors, our relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.
Based on our adoption of the CECL Standard on January 1, 2020, our continuing review of the overall loan portfolio, the current asset quality of the portfolio, the growth in the loan portfolio, the net charge-offs, and current and forecasted

economic conditions, a provision for credit losses of $11.5 million was recorded in 2020, as compared to $5.7 million in 2019. The increase in allowance for credit losses in the first half of 2020 was primarily related to the reasonable and supportable forecast component of the newly adopted CECL Standard which includes the impact of COVID-19. COVID-19 continues to have a profound impact on economic activity. While there have been some signs of economic improvement during the latter half of 2020, significant uncertainty remains. Management still believes that the economic recovery will continue during 2021 and 2022, however, based on the aforementioned uncertainty and negative impact the virus has had to date, the decision was made to maintain the current risk level for the reasonable and supportable forecast component of the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020.
Net charge-offs were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charge-offs in 2020 relate primarily to one relationship that totaled $2.7 million as of June 30, 2020. In the 2020 third quarter, a settlement agreement was entered into resulting in $1.4 million in payments and a charge-off totaling $1.3 million. The charge-offs in 2019 relate primarily to the $3.7 million charge-off related to one CRE loan totaling $16.3 million which was written down to the loan’s estimated fair value of $12.6 million and moved into loans held for sale in June 2019. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to non-accrual loans was 363% and 750% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The allowance for credit losses totaled $44.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $32.8 million at December 31, 2019. The allowance as a percentage of total loans was 0.96% and 0.89% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The addition of PPP loans, which are expected to be fully guaranteed by the SBA and have a nominal reserve associated with them, decreased the allowance as a percentage of total loans by 20 basis points at December 31, 2020. We continue to carefully monitor the loan portfolio as well as real estate trends in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the New York City boroughs.
Loans totaling $121.7 million, or 2.6%, of total loans at December 31, 2020 were categorized as classified loans compared to $88.3 million or 2.4%, at December 31, 2019. Classified loans include loans with credit quality indicators with the internally assigned grades of special mention, substandard and doubtful. These loans are categorized as classified loans as we have information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms. These loans are subject to increased management attention and their classification is reviewed at least quarterly.
At December 31, 2020, $43.3 million of these classified loans were commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans. Of the $43.3 million of CRE loans, $35.9 million were current and $7.4 million were past due. At December 31, 2020, $20.0 million of classified loans were residential real estate loans with $15.7 million current and $4.3 million past due. Commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans represented $47.7 million of classified loans, with $41.2 million current and $6.5 million past due. Taxi medallion loans represented $9.6 million of the classified commercial, industrial and agricultural loans at December 31, 2020. All of our taxi medallion loans are collateralized by New York City medallions and have personal guarantees. No new originations of taxi medallion loans are currently planned, and we expect these balances to continue to decline through amortization and pay-offs. In January 2021, six taxi medallion loans, totaling $2.6 million, net of charge-offs, were paid off under settlements we accepted. The charge-offs related to the settlements were recognized in January 2021. At December 31, 2020, there was $8.5 million of classified multi-family loans which were current; $1.2 million of classified real estate construction and land loans substantially all of which were current; and $1.0 million of classified consumer loans substantially all of which were current.
CRE loans, including multi-family loans, represented $2.5 billion, or 55.1%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 compared to $2.4 billion, or 64.8%, at December 31, 2019. Our underwriting standards for CRE loans require an evaluation of the cash flow of the property, the overall cash flow of the borrower and related guarantors as well as the value of the real estate securing the loan. In addition, our underwriting standards for CRE loans are consistent with regulatory requirements with original loan to value ratios generally less than or equal to 75%. We consider charge-off history, delinquency trends, cash flow analysis, and the impact of the local economy on CRE values when evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $20.3 million in loans which were individually evaluated, with a specific reserve of $6.7 million. Individually evaluated loans include $9.6 million of taxi medallion loans. As of June 30, 2020, taxi loans were changed from being collectively evaluated to individually evaluated. While our collectively evaluated taxi loans were all performing in accordance with the terms of the renewals, the taxi industry, like many others, suffered greatly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantially all of our taxi borrowers requested payment moratoriums and until such time as business fully resumes and cash flows return to normal, we will value the taxi loans assuming they are collateral

dependent. As of December 31, 2019, we had individually impaired loans as defined by FASB ASC No. 310, “Receivables” (prior to adoption of the CECL Standard) of $27.0 million, with a specific reserve totaling $4.7 million. Impaired loans include individually classified non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructuring loans (“TDRs”). At December 31, 2019, impaired loans also included $1.1 million in other impaired performing loans which were related to borrowers with other performing TDRs. Upon adoption of the CECL Standard on January 1, 2020, we re-evaluated our impaired loans to determine which loans should be evaluated on a collective (pooled) basis and which loans do not share similar risk characteristics with loans evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis and therefore should be individually evaluated. The majority of our impaired loans at December 31, 2019 were performing TDRs where there was no write-off of principal as a result of the restructure and interest was at a market rate. We concluded the risks associated with these loans were consistent with the other pooled loans and therefore they were appropriately evaluated on a collective (pooled) basis under the CECL Standard.
Non-accrual loans were $12.2 million, or 0.26%, of total loans at December 31, 2020 compared to $4.4 million, or 0.12%, of total loans at December 31, 2019. TDRs represent $346 thousand of the non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020 and $405 thousand at December 31, 2019.
There was no other real estate owned at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table presents changes in the allowance for credit losses:

Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses
The following table presents the allocation of the total allowance for credit losses by loan classification:
Non-Interest Income
Total non-interest income decreased $5.7 million, or 22.4%, to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline in total non-interest income in the current year compared to 2019 was driven by a $3.7 million decrease in loan swap fees, a $3.4 million loss on termination of swaps, a $2.9 million decrease in fair value of loans held for sale, and a $1.1 million decrease in service charges and other fees, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in net securities gains, a $2.0 million increase in gain on sale of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, and a $0.6 million increase in title fees.
During the third quarter of 2020, we restructured our wholesale balance sheet, offsetting net securities gains of $3.5 million with swap termination losses of $3.4 million, which positively impacted our net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2020.
During the second quarter of 2020, an additional write-down was recognized on one CRE mortgage loan held for sale for the decrease in the estimated fair value of the loan by $2.6 million to $10.0 million through a valuation allowance which was charged against non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
Loan swap fees recorded on interest rate swaps decreased to $3.7 million in 2020, compared to $7.5 million in 2019. We increased the notional amount of interest rate swaps to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $823.8 million at December 31, 2019. The loan swap program allows us to deliver fixed rate exposure to our customers while we retain a floating rate asset and generate fee income. These interest rate swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, and therefore changes in fair value are reported in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
Non-Interest Expense
Total non-interest expense increased $17.1 million, or 17.8%, to $113.3 million in 2020 compared to $96.1 million in 2019. The increase was mainly due to expenses associated with the Merger, and higher salaries and benefits, technology and communications, professional services, and FDIC assessment expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and advertising and other operating expenses in 2020.
Salaries and employee benefits increased to $67.2 million in 2020 compared to $56.2 million in 2019. The rise in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to stock acceleration expense related to the Merger and higher incentive accruals in 2020.
Page -35-
Technology and communications increased to $9.7 million in 2020 compared to $7.9 million in 2019. The rise in technology and communications expenses reflect higher software maintenance and system services expenses as we increased our investment in technology and expanded our use of automation in 2020.
FDIC assessments increased to $2.0 million in 2020, compared to $0.6 million in 2019, primarily due to FDIC assessment credits totaling $0.7 million in 2019.
Marketing and advertising decreased to $3.3 million in 2020 compared to $4.7 million in 2019. Professional services increased to $5.0 million in 2020 compared to $3.8 million in 2019. We recorded amortization of other intangible assets of $0.7 million in 2020 and $0.8 million in 2019, related to the CNB and FNBNY core deposit intangible assets subject to amortization. Other operating expenses increased to $6.8 million in 2020 compared to $7.7 million in 2019.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense decreased to $13.7 million in 2020 compared to $14.1 million in 2019, reflecting lower income before income taxes, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in 2020. The effective tax rate for 2020 was 24.6%, compared to 21.4% for 2019. The increase in our effective tax rate resulted primarily from non-deductible salaries and merger expenses related to the Merger.
Financial Condition
Total assets were $6.4 billion at December 31, 2020, $1.5 billion, or 30.7%, higher than December 31, 2019. The rise in total assets in 2020 reflects increases in loans held for investment and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in securities.
Cash and cash equivalents increased $759.6 million, or 648.2%, to $876.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Total securities decreased $245.4 million to $559.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Total loans held for investment, net, increased $917.1 million, or 24.9%, to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, inclusive of PPP loans totaling $844.7 million. Net deferred loan fees were $8.2 million at December 31, 2020, inclusive of $15.4 million remaining unamortized net loan fees related to PPP loans. Our focus is on our ability to grow the loan portfolio, while maintaining interest rate risk sensitivity and maintaining credit quality.
Total liabilities were $5.9 billion at December 31, 2020, $1.5 billion higher than December 31, 2019. The increase in total liabilities in 2020 was mainly due to deposit growth, primarily attributable to PPP related deposits, partially offset by a decrease in FHLB advances.
Total deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 43.9%, to $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The increase in total deposits in 2020 was largely attributable to higher demand deposits and savings, NOW and money market deposits, partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit. Demand deposits increased $953.8 million, or 62.8% year-over-year, to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The rise in demand deposits in 2020 was primarily driven by an inflow of PPP-related deposits. Savings, NOW and money market deposits increased $740.4 million, or 37.2% year-over-year, to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Certificates of deposit decreased $19.5 million, or 6.3% year-over-year, to $288.4 million at December 31, 2020. FHLB advances decreased $220.0 million, or 50.6% year-over-year, to $215.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decline in FHLB advances was mainly due to our decreased reliance on borrowings in 2020 by using deposit growth to fund our loan portfolio growth.
Total stockholders’ equity was $517.8 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $20.7 million, or 4.2%, from December 31, 2019. We adopted the CECL Standard on January 1, 2020, which resulted in a charge to retained earnings and reduction to stockholders’ equity of $1.5 million. The increase in stockholders’ equity was largely attributable to net income of $42.0 million, partially offset by $19.2 million in dividends, and $4.6 million in purchases of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 179,620 shares purchased under the 2019 Stock Repurchase Program at a cost of $4.6 million.

Loans
During 2020, despite the pandemic, we continued to experience growth in the commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loan portfolios, coupled with significant growth in the commercial, industrial and agricultural loan portfolio as a result of the PPP loans. The concentration of loans in our primary market areas may increase risk. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, our loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in our principal lending areas of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs. The local economic conditions on Long Island and the New York City boroughs have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations, the quality of loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans. A considerable decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our operations. Additionally, decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings.
The interest rates charged by us on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by our competitors, our relationship with the customer, and the related credit risks of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions including, but not limited to, monetary policies of the federal government, including the FRB, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters.
We target our business lending and marketing initiatives towards promotion of loans that primarily meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
With respect to the underwriting of loans, there are certain risks, including the risk of non-payment that are associated with each type of loan that we market. Approximately 66.3% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 was secured by real estate. Commercial real estate loans represented 35.6% of our loan portfolio. Multi-family mortgage loans represented 19.5% of our loan portfolio. Residential real estate mortgage loans represented 9.4% of our loan portfolio, including home equity lines of credit representing 1.4% and residential mortgages representing 8.0% of our loan portfolio. Real estate construction and land loans represented 1.8% of our loan portfolio. Risks associated with a concentration in real estate loans include potential losses from fluctuating values of land and improved properties. Home equity loans represent loans originated in our geographic markets with original loan to value ratios generally of 75% or less. Our residential mortgage portfolio included approximately $14.7 million in interest only mortgages at December 31, 2020. The underwriting standards for interest only mortgages are consistent with the remainder of the loan portfolio and do not include any features that result in negative amortization. We use conservative underwriting criteria to better insulate us from a downturn in real estate values and economic conditions on Long Island and the New York City boroughs that could have a significant impact on the value of collateral securing the loans as well as the ability of customers to repay loans.
The remainder of the loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and consumer loans, which represented 33.7% of our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2020. The commercial loans are made to businesses and include term loans, lines of credit, senior secured loans to corporations, equipment financing, taxi medallion loans and, beginning in 2020, PPP loans. The primary risks associated with commercial loans are the cash flow of the business, the experience and quality of the borrowers’ management, the business climate, and the impact of economic factors. The primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower, such as the risk of a borrower’s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the amount and nature of a borrower’s other existing indebtedness, and the value of the collateral securing the loan if we must take possession of the collateral.
Our policy for charging off loans is a multi-step process. A loan is considered a potential charge-off when it is in default of either principal or interest for a period of 90, 120 or 180 days, depending upon the loan type, as of the end of the prior month. In addition to delinquency criteria, other triggering events may include, but are not limited to, notice of bankruptcy by the borrower or guarantor, death of the borrower, and deficiency balance from the sale of collateral. These loans identified are presented for evaluation at the regular meeting of the CRMC. A loan is charged off when a loss is reasonably assured. The recovery of charged-off balances is actively pursued until the potential for recovery has been exhausted, or until the expense of collection does not justify the recovery efforts.
Page -37-
Total loans grew $917.1 million, or 24.9%, to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2019, with commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans being the largest contributor of the growth. Commercial, industrial and agricultural loans increased $847.7 million, or 124.8% in 2020 as a result of PPP loans totaling $844.7 million at December 31, 2020. Multi-family mortgage loans increased $87.6 million, or 10.8%, in 2020. Commercial real estate mortgage loans increased $72.8 million, or 4.7%, during 2020. Residential real estate mortgage loans decreased $58.5 million, or 11.9%, during 2020. Real estate construction and land loans decreased $14.8 million, or 15.2%, in 2020. Installment/consumer loans decreased slightly during 2020. Fixed rate loans represented 35.5% and 21.9% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in fixed rate loans from December 31, 2019 relates to the PPP loans.
The following table presents the major classifications of loans at the dates indicated:
Selected Loan Maturity Information
The following table presents the approximate maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates of certain loans, exclusive of real estate mortgage loans and installment/consumer loans to individuals as of December 31, 2020:
(1) Included in the “After One But Within Five Years” column are fixed rate PPP loans totaling $844.7 million.
(2) Included in the “After Five Years” column are one-step construction loans that contain a preliminary construction period (interest only) that automatically converts to amortization at the end of the construction phase.
Page -38-
Past Due, Non-accrual and Restructured Loans and Other Real Estate Owned
The following table presents selected information about past due, non-accrual, and restructured loans and other real estate owned:
Securities
Securities decreased $245.4 million to $559.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, including restricted securities totaling $23.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $32.9 million at December 31, 2019. The available for sale portfolio decreased $187.9 million to $450.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Securities classified as available for sale may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors. During 2020, we sold $149.5 million of securities available for sale compared to $46.2 million in 2019. The decrease in securities available for sale is primarily the result of a $149.0 million decrease in residential collateral mortgage obligations, a $50.8 million decrease in U.S. Treasury securities and a $41.8 million decrease in commercial collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by a $28.5 million increase in residential mortgage-backed, $11.1 million increase in commercial mortgage-backed, and $11.3 million increase in Corporate bonds. Securities held to maturity decreased $47.9 million to $85.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease in securities held to maturity is primarily the result of a $21.4 million decrease in residential collateralized mortgage obligations and a $17.3 million decrease in state and municipal obligations. Fixed rate securities represented 82.4% of total available for sale and held to maturity securities at December 31, 2020 compared to 88.2% at December 31, 2019.
Page -39-
The following table presents the fair values, amortized costs, contractual maturities and approximate weighted average yields of the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios at December 31, 2020. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%.
Deposits and Borrowings
Borrowings, consisting of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and subordinated debentures, decreased $219.6 million year-over-year to $295.3 million at December 31, 2020. Total deposits increased $1.7 billion to $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Individual, partnership and corporate (“IPC deposits”) account balances increased $1.3 billion and public funds and brokered deposits increased $378.6 million. The increase in deposits is attributable to an increase in savings, NOW and money market deposits of $740.4 million, or 37.2%, to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, and an increase in demand deposits of $953.8 million, or 62.8%, to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2020,
Page -40-
partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $19.5 million, or 6.3%, to $288.4 million at December 31, 2020. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more increased $1.9 million, or 0.9%, from December 31, 2019 and other time deposits decreased $21.5 million, or 22.9%, compared to December 31, 2019.
The following table presents the remaining maturities of the Bank’s time deposits at December 31, 2020:
Liquidity
Our liquidity management objectives are to ensure the sufficiency of funds available to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers, and to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities for our growth or earnings enhancement. Liquidity management addresses our ability to meet financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments and deposit withdrawals, either on demand or on contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise.
The Holding Company’s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2020, and dividend capabilities from the Bank. Cash available for distribution of dividends to our shareholders is primarily derived from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. During 2020, the Bank paid $26.5 million in cash dividends to the Holding Company. Prior regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the Bank’s net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. As of January 1, 2021, the Bank had $49.8 million of retained net income available for dividends to the Holding Company. In the event that the Holding Company subsequently expands its current operations, in addition to dividends from the Bank, it will need to rely on its own earnings, additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs. The Holding Company did not make any capital contributions to the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Bank’s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Bank’s operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and investment securities principal repayments and maturities, lines of credit with other financial institutions including the FHLB and FRB, growth in core deposits and sources of wholesale funding such as brokered deposits. While scheduled loan amortization, maturing securities and short-term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit flows, loans, and asset and liability management objectives. Historically, the Bank has relied on its deposit base, drawn through its full-service branches that serve its market area and local municipal deposits, as its principal source of funding. The Bank seeks to retain existing deposits and loans and maintain customer relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers, while managing the overall cost of funds needed to finance its strategies.
The Bank’s Asset/Liability and Funds Management Policy allows for wholesale borrowings of up to 25% of total assets. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had aggregate lines of credit of $418.0 million with unaffiliated correspondent banks to provide short-term credit for liquidity requirements. Of these aggregate lines of credit, $398.0 million is available on an unsecured basis. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had no overnight borrowings outstanding under these lines. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had no overnight borrowings outstanding under these lines. The Bank also has the ability, as a member of the FHLB system, to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the
Page -41-
Bank. The Bank also has a master repurchase agreement with the FHLB, which increases its borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had no FHLB overnight borrowings outstanding and $215.0 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had $195.0 million outstanding in FHLB overnight borrowings and $240.0 million outstanding in FHLB term borrowings. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $1.2 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $1.0 million outstanding with customers and nothing outstanding with brokers. In addition, the Bank has approved broker relationships for the purpose of issuing brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $64.1 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposit and $50.2 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had $77.3 million outstanding in brokered certificates of deposits and $85.1 million outstanding in brokered money market accounts.
Liquidity policies are established by senior management and reviewed and approved by the full Board of Directors at least annually. Management continually monitors the liquidity position and believes that sufficient liquidity exists to meet all of the Company’s operating requirements. The Bank’s liquidity levels are affected by the use of short-term and wholesale borrowings and the amount of public funds in the deposit mix. Excess short-term liquidity is invested in overnight federal funds sold or in an interest-earning account at the FRB.
Contractual Obligations
In the ordinary course of operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations.
The following table presents contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2020:
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. At December 31, 2020, we had $150.5 million in outstanding loan commitments and $808.3 million in outstanding commitments for various lines of credit including unused overdraft lines. We also had $25.5 million of standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2020. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.
Capital Resources
Stockholders’ equity increased $20.7 million year-over-year to $517.8 million at December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of net income, partially offset by dividends declared and purchases of treasury stock. We adopted the CECL Standard on January 1, 2020, which resulted in a charge to retained earnings and reduction to stockholders’ equity of $1.5 million. The

ratio of average stockholders’ equity to average total assets was 8.67% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 10.11% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company’s capital strength is paralleled by the solid capital position of the Bank, as reflected in the excess of its regulatory capital ratios over the risk-based capital adequacy ratio levels required for classification as a “well capitalized” institution by the FDIC (see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
We utilize cash dividends and stock repurchases to manage our capital levels. In 2020, the Company declared four quarterly cash dividends totaling $19.2 million compared to four quarterly cash dividends of $18.4 million in 2019. The dividend payout ratios for 2020 and 2019 were 45.66% and 35.63%, respectively. In February 2019, we announced the approval of a stock repurchase plan for up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock. There is no expiration date for the stock repurchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 179,620 shares of our common stock under the repurchase plan at a cost of $4.6 million.
Our return on average equity decreased to 8.26% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 10.84% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our return on average assets decreased to 0.72% in 2020 compared to 1.10% in 2019. The year-over-year decreases in return on average equity and return on average assets were due to lower net income in 2020 compared to 2019.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or in the same magnitude, as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, which are beyond our control, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and federal agencies, particularly the FRB.
