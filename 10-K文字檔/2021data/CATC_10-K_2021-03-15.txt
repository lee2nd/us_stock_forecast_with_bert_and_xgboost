Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
Cambridge Bancorp (together with its bank subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”) is a Massachusetts state-chartered, federally registered bank holding company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Company is a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1983 and has one banking subsidiary, Cambridge Trust Company (the “Bank”), formed in 1890. At December 31, 2020, the Company had total assets of approximately $3.9 billion. Currently, the Bank operates 21 private banking offices in Eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The Company’s Wealth Management Group has five offices, one in Boston and Wellesley, Massachusetts and three in New Hampshire in Concord, Manchester, and Portsmouth. The Company’s Assets under Management and Administration as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $4.2 billion. The Bank’s clients consist primarily of small- and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in these communities and surrounding areas throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
The Company’s results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The results of operations are also affected by the level of income and fees from wealth management services, loans, deposits, as well as operating expenses, the provision for credit losses, the impact of federal and state income taxes, and the relative levels of interest rates and economic activity.
Critical Accounting Policies
Accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact income, are considered critical accounting policies.
The Company considers allowance for credit losses and income taxes to be its critical accounting policies.
Allowance for credit losses
The Company adopted ASU-2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”) during the first quarter of 2020. ASU 2016-13, which has been codified under Topic 326, replaced the previous GAAP method of calculating loan losses. Previously, GAAP required the use of the incurred loss methodology versus ASU 2016-13 which utilizes an expected loss methodology. The use of an expected loss methodology, referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology, requires institutions to account for potential losses that previously would not have been part of the calculation. The CECL methodology incorporates forecasting in addition to historical and current measures utilized in the prior incurred loss methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, held to maturity and available for sale debt securities.
Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) consists of quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitative component of the ACL is model based and utilizes a forward-looking macroeconomic forecast, complemented by a qualitative component in estimating expected credit losses. The qualitative component of the ACL considers (i) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios; (ii) certain portfolio characteristics, such as portfolio concentrations, real estate values, changes in the number and amount of non-accrual and past due loans; and (iii) model limitations; among other factors.
ASU 2016-13 also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar investment;) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842).
Losses on loan receivables are estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan, based on expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date. The Company uses a discounted cash flow method incorporating probability of default and loss given default forecasted based on statistically derived economic variable loss drivers combined with qualitative factors to estimate expected credit losses. This process includes estimates which involve modeling loss projections attributable to existing loan balances, considering historical experience, current conditions, and future expectations for homogeneous pools of loans over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The historical information either experienced by the Company or by a selection of peer banks when appropriate, is derived from a combination of recessionary and non-recessionary performance periods for which data is available.
The reasonable and supportable forecast period is primarily determined based upon the stability of current economic conditions at each measurement date. Management considers the accuracy level of historical loss forecast estimates, the specific loan level models and methodology utilized, and considers material changes in growth and credit strategy; and business changes which may not be applicable within the current environment. For periods beyond a reasonable and supportable forecast interval, we revert to historical information over a period for which comparable data is available.
We also perform a qualitative assessment beyond model estimates and apply qualitative adjustments as management deems necessary Adjustments are considered when management believes expected credit losses are not representative of historical loss experience alone, and should be adjusted to reflect the current conditions and characteristics of the Company’s own portfolio. They are made at the segment level, considering any required adjustments for differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, and other relevant data shifts over time.
We evaluate the allowance for credit losses quarterly. We regularly review our collection experience (including delinquencies and net charge-offs) in determining our allowance for credit losses. We also consider our historical loss experience to date based on actual defaulted loans and overall portfolio indicators including delinquent and non-accrual loans, trends in loan volume and lending terms, credit policies and other observable environmental factors such as unemployment and interest rate changes.
The underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses reflect management’s best estimate of model assumptions and forecasted conditions at that time. Changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for credit losses. It is possible and likely that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates. Charge-offs are deducted from the allowance for credit losses when we judge the principal to be uncollectible, and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance, generally at the time cash is received on a charged-off account.
The expected credit losses for unfunded commitments are measured over the contractual period of the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The estimate of credit loss incorporates assumptions for both the likelihood and amount of funding over the estimated life of the commitments, for the risk of loss, and current conditions and expectations. Management periodically reviews and updates its assumptions for estimated funding rates based on historical rates, and factors such as portfolio growth, changes to organizational structure, economic conditions, borrowing habits, or any other factor which could impact the likelihood that funding will occur. The Company does not reserve for unfunded commitments which are unconditionally cancellable.
Income Taxes
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of New Hampshire, the State of Maine, and other states as required. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense. Deferred tax assets are reviewed quarterly and reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the information available, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense.
Recent Accounting Developments
See Note 3 - Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on other recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on the Company’s financial statements.
COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak to constitute a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a range of industries.
The impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and its customers has not fully manifested in 2020. The fiscal stimulus and relief programs appear to have delayed any materially adverse financial impact to the Company. Once these stimulus programs have been exhausted, loan credit metrics may worsen and credit losses may ultimately materialize. The magnitude of future credit losses may be affected by the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and businesses in the long and short term. However, economic uncertainty remains high and bouts of elevated volatility are expected to continue, which may have a future adverse financial impact on the Company. The extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees, and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Please see Risk Factors above for more detail on risks related to COVID-19.
Results of Operations
Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
General. Net income increased by $6.7 million, or 26.5%, to $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in net interest and dividend income after the provision for credit losses and a $3.1 million increase in noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by a $19.9 million increase in noninterest expense and higher income tax expenses of $2.7 million. Diluted earnings per share were $5.03 for 2020, representing a 6.3% decrease over diluted earnings per share of $5.37 for 2019.
The results for the year ended December 31, 2020, included the merger accounting impact of the current expected credit loss accounting standard (“CECL”) within the provision for credit losses, merger expenses, office closures and related one-time occupancy expenses, and other non-operating items. Operating net income, excluding these items, was $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $14.7 million, or 50.5%, as compared to operating net income of $29.2 million for 2019. Operating diluted earnings per share were $6.90 for 2020, representing an 11.3% increase over operating diluted earnings per share of $6.20 for 2019.
Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income before provision for credit losses increased by $41.5 million, or 52.8%, to $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to loan growth (both organic and as a result of the Optima and Wellesley mergers), lower cost of funds, loan accretion associated with merger accounting and accelerated interest income from Payment Protection Program (“PPP”) loans forgiven during the year.
•
Interest on loans increased by $35.4 million, or 41.6%, primarily due to merger related loan growth.
•
Interest on deposits decreased $8.3 million, or 53.4%, due to a decrease in interest rates paid on these deposits.
Total average interest-earning assets increased by $850.7 million, or 34.6%, to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.5 billion in 2019. The Company’s net interest margin, on a fully tax equivalent basis, increased 43 basis points to 3.65% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 3.22% in 2019, and the net interest rate spread increased 59 basis points to 3.52% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2.93% in 2019.
Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased by $33.0 million, or 34.3%, to $129.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $96.3 million in 2019, primarily due to loan growth, as a result of the Optima and Wellesley mergers, loan accretion associated with merger accounting, and accelerated interest income from PPP loans forgiven during the year.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $8.5 million, or 48.2% to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $17.6 million in 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in cost of deposits.
Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $487.7 million to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily related to the mergers with Optima and Wellesley coupled with organic core deposit growth. The average cost of funds decreased to 0.28% at December 31, 2020 from 0.72% at December 31, 2019. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by higher average savings account balances of $110.0 million, higher average money market accounts of $160.3 million, higher average certificates of deposits of $38.3 million, and higher average borrowed funds of $37.0 million.
Provision for Credit Losses. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a provision for loan losses of $3.0 million in 2019. The provision includes $9.4 million associated with the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future loan losses and $8.6 million for the recognition of the non-operating impact of the merger related CECL accounting. The Company recorded net charge-offs of $439,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net charge-offs of $1.6 million during the same period in 2019.
The allowance for credit losses was $36.0 million, or 1.14% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, as compared to $18.2 million, or 0.82% of total loans outstanding at year end 2019.
Noninterest Income. Inclusive of the Wellesley merger, total noninterest income increased by $3.1 million, or 8.6%, to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $36.4 million for the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of higher Wealth Management revenue and higher gains on loans sold, partially offset by lower deposit and ATM related fees, lower loan related derivative income and other fee income. Total noninterest income was 24.7% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•
Wealth Management revenue increased by $3.3 million, or 12.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the Wellesley merger and appreciation in the equity markets during 2020. Assets Under Management combined with Assets Under Administration were $4.2 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2019.
•
Gain on loans sold increased by $680,000 as compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increased sales of residential mortgage loans given the low-rate environment and active refinance market.
•
Deposit account fees decreased by $590,000, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of lower transactional fee activity during the year.
•
Other income decreased $201,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of lower loan prepayment income during the year.
•
ATM/Debit card income decreased $105,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on transactions during 2020.
•
Loan related derivative income decreased $195,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to valuation adjustments associated with changes in interest rates on existing derivative transactions.
The categories of Wealth Management revenues are shown in the following table:
The following table presents the changes in wealth management assets under management:
There were no significant changes to the average fee rates and fee structure for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Noninterest Expense. Total noninterest expense increased by $19.9 million, or 25.5%, to $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits expense, merger and other non-operating expenses including branch and office closure related expense, occupancy and equipment expense, and data processing expenses resulting from our mergers with Optima in 2019 and Wellesley in 2020, as described below.
•
Salaries and employee benefits increased $11.5 million, or 24.2%, primarily as a result of the increased staffing related to the mergers with Optima and Wellesley in 2019 and 2020, respectively, additions to support business initiatives, normal merit increases and higher employee benefit costs.
•
Non-operating expenses increased $2.9 million primarily due to merger expenses associated with the Wellesley merger and branch and office closure expenses of $1.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased by $2.1 million, or 19.8%, primarily as a result of additional branches and office space as a result of the mergers with Optima and Wellesley.
•
Data processing expense increased by $1.4 million, or 22.9%, primarily as a result of increased client activity associated with the mergers with Optima and Wellesley.
Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded income tax expense of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was 26.3%, as compared to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020, to help stimulate the United States economy. One of the business tax provisions of the CARES Act included allowing net operating losses (“NOL”) generated by the Company in tax years 2018 and 2019 to be carried back up to five years at the tax rates in effect during those periods, rather than carried forward at current federal tax rates of 21%. The effect of the Act allowed the Company to recognize lower tax expense associated with NOL carryforwards from 2018 and 2019 (as a result of the Optima merger) and resulted in a benefit of $539,000.
Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
General. Net income increased by $1.4 million, or 5.8%, to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $13.6 million increase in net interest and dividend income after the provision for loan losses and a $3.4 million increase in noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by a $14.2 million increase in noninterest expense and higher provision for income taxes of $1.5 million. Diluted earnings per share were $5.37 for 2019, representing a 6.9% decrease over diluted earnings per share of $5.77 for 2018. Net income for 2019 included non-operating expenses of $4.7 million related to costs associated with the Company’s December common stock offering and merger related expenses resulting from the completed merger with Optima and the pending merger with Wellesley.
Excluding non-operating expenses, operating net income was $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.1 million, or 21.4%, as compared to operating net income of $24.0 million for 2018. Operating diluted earnings per share were $6.20 for 2019, representing a 7% increase over operating diluted earnings per share of $5.80 for 2018.
Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses increased by $15.1 million, or 23.8%, to $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $63.6 million for the year ended 2018, primarily due to loan growth, both organic and as a result of the Optima merger and higher levels of interest-earning assets.
•
Interest on loans increased by $26.7 million, or 45.7%, primarily due to organic loan growth and the impact of loan balances acquired related to the Optima merger.
•
Interest on deposits increased $10.6 million, or 211.4%, due to an increase in cost primarily as a result of the impact of the cost of deposits acquired from our merger with Optima and growth within our higher cost savings products.
Total average interest-earning assets increased by $532.0 million, or 27.7%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1.9 billion in 2018. The Company’s net interest margin, on a fully tax equivalent basis, decreased 11 basis points to 3.22% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 3.33% in 2018, and the net interest rate spread decreased 26 basis points to 2.93% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 3.19% in 2018.
Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased by $27.3 million, or 39.5%, to $96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $69.1 million in 2018, primarily due to a $26.7 million increase in interest income on loans.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $12.2 million, or 222.7% to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $5.5 million in 2018, primarily as a result of the impact of the cost of deposits acquired from our merger with Optima and growth within our higher cost savings products.
Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $462.6 million to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019 from $1.3 billion, which contributed to a 44 basis points increase in the average cost of funds of 0.72% from 0.28%. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by higher average savings account balances of $202.9 million, higher average money market accounts of $96.4 million, higher average certificates of deposits of $87.3 million, and higher average other borrowed funds of $68.0 million.
Provision for Loan Losses. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.5 million in 2018. The increase is the result of strong loan growth and a $1.2 million charge-off on an acquired commercial real estate loan during the third quarter of 2019. The charge-off was taken upon receipt of information indicating misstatements of fact and potential borrower fraud. We believe this to be an isolated incident and do not have any additional exposure to the borrower. We recorded net charge-offs of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net charge-offs of $54,000 during the same period in 2018. The allowance for loan losses was $18.2 million, or 0.82% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2019, as compared to $16.8 million, or 1.08% of total loans outstanding at year end 2018.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased by $3.4 million, or 10.3%, to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $33.0 million for the same period in 2018, primarily as a result of higher Wealth Management revenue, higher gains on loans sold and higher loan prepayment income. Total noninterest income was 31.6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.
•
Wealth Management revenue increased by $1.3 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to higher average assets under management during the period and higher average fees. Assets under Management combined with Assets under Administration were $3.5 billion at December 31, 2019, as compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018.
•
Gain on loans sold increased by $1.1 million as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the sale of residential mortgages totaling $90.0 million during 2019.
•
Other income increased $658,000 during the year ended 2019 primarily as a result of higher loan prepayment income during the year.
The categories of Wealth Management revenues are shown in the following table:
There were no significant changes to the average fee rates and fee structure for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased by $14.2 million, or 22.2%, to $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by an increase in non-operating expenses, salaries and employee benefit expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing fees, and professional service fees. The increase to noninterest expense was partially offset by lower marketing, and FDIC insurance expenses.
•
Non-operating expense of $4.7 million were primarily related to professional fees, compensation and severance payments, and contract termination costs associated with the Optima merger combined with expenses associated with the pending Wellesley merger and the December 2019 common equity offering.
•
Salaries and employee benefit increases of $6.3 million were primarily the result of the merger with Optima, increased staffing to support business initiatives, and higher employee benefit costs.
•
Occupancy and equipment expense increases of $1.8 million were primarily due to the merger with Optima and additional office space in Boston, Massachusetts.
•
Data processing expense increases of $1.1 million were primarily due to increased transaction volume related to the merger with Optima and investments made in technology.
Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded income tax expense of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2018, reflecting effective tax rates of 25.5% and 23.2%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the costs associated with the Optima merger, the pending Wellesley merger and the common stock offering completed during the fourth quarter of 2019, as some of these items were nondeductible for tax purposes.
Changes in Financial Condition
Total Assets. Inclusive of the merger with Wellesley and organic growth, total assets increased $1.1 billion, or 38.3%, from December 31, 2019 and were $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance. The Company invests in bank-owned life insurance to help offset the costs of our employee benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides noninterest income that is nontaxable. At December 31, 2020, our investment in bank-owned life insurance was $46.2 million, an $8.9 million increase from $37.3 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to new policies acquired as a result of the Wellesley merger.
Goodwill and Merger Related intangibles. The Company recorded additional goodwill of $20.7 million during the second quarter of 2020 due to the Wellesley merger. Goodwill and merger related intangible assets totaled $54.9 million at December 31, 2020.
Other Assets. Other assets increased $40.9 million, or 96.8% to $83.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $42.3 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher loan related derivative assets at December 31, 2020.
Deposits. Total deposits increased by $1.0 billion, or 44.3%, to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020, from $2.4 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily driven by a combination of the impact of the Wellesley merger and organic core deposit growth.
•
Core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits other than certificates of deposit, increased by $971.7 million, or 44.6%, to $3.1 billion from $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019.
•
Excluding the impact of the Wellesley merger, organic growth in core deposits was $422.9 million, or 19.4%, as of December 31, 2020.
Certificates of deposit, which totaled $254.8 million at December 31, 2020, increased by $72.5 million from $182.3 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of the Wellesley merger. Total brokered certificates of deposit, which are included within certificates of deposit, were $30.8 million and $7.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
For further details on the loans and deposits acquired, see the “Organic Loan and Deposit Growth” table provided at the end of this section.
Borrowings. At December 31, 2020, borrowings consisted of advances from the FHLB of Boston. Total borrowings decreased $102.7 million, or 75.7%, to $33.0 million at December 31, 2020, from $135.7 million at December 31, 2019 as the Company utilized excess cash to pay down borrowings. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company redeemed $10.0 million in subordinated debt, bearing a 6.0% coupon, assumed as part of the Wellesley merger.
Shareholders’ Equity. Total shareholders’ equity increased $115.2 million, or 40.2%, to $401.7 million at December 31, 2020, from $286.6 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to $87.2 million of equity issued as a result of the Wellesley merger, net income of $32.0 million, before tax-effect increases in the value of the Company’s interest rate derivative positions of $4.7 million, and before tax-effect increases in unrealized gains on the available for sale investment portfolio of $3.6 million, partially offset by regular dividend payments of $13.1 million paid during the year.
The Company’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 8.91% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 8.93% at December 31, 2019. Tangible book value per share increased by $3.41, or 7.3%, to $50.07 as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $46.66 as of December 31, 2019.

Investment Securities
The Company’s securities portfolio consists of securities available for sale (“AFS”) and securities held to maturity (“HTM”). The largest component of the securities portfolio is mortgage-backed securities, all of which are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.
Securities available for sale consist of certain U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises (“GSE”) obligations, U.S. GSE mortgage-backed securities, and corporate debt securities. These securities are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses net of applicable income taxes are recognized as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. The fair value of securities available for sale totaled $237.0 million and included gross unrealized gains of $3.2 million and gross unrealized losses of $406,000 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of securities available for sale totaled $140.3 million and included gross unrealized gains of $231,000 and gross unrealized losses of $1.0 million.
Securities classified as held to maturity consist of certain U.S. GSE obligations, U.S. GSE mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and state, county, and municipal securities. Securities held to maturity as of December 31, 2020 are carried at their amortized cost of $247.7 million. At December 31, 2019, the amortized cost of securities held to maturity totaled $258.2 million.
The following tables set forth the composition and maturities of investment securities. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Weighted Average Yield is shown on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of 21% for 2020 and 2019.
The Company adopted Topic 326 on January 1, 2020 and did not record an allowance for credit losses on its investment securities as of December 31, 2020. The Company regularly reviews debt securities for expected credit loss using both qualitative and quantitative criteria, as necessary based on the composition of the portfolio at period end.
Prior to January 1, 2020, investment securities were evaluated by management for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warranted such evaluation. Consideration is given to: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
As of December 31, 2020, 30 debt securities had gross unrealized losses, with an aggregate depreciation of 0.47% from the Company’s amortized cost basis. The largest unrealized loss percentage of any single security was 2.07%, or $55,000, the largest unrealized dollar loss of a single security of its amortized cost.
As of December 31, 2019, 68 debt securities had gross unrealized losses, with an aggregate depreciation of 0.74% from the Company’s amortized cost basis. The largest unrealized loss percentage of any single security was 3.15%, or $63,000, of its amortized cost. The largest unrealized dollar loss of any single security was $96,000, or 1.93%, of its amortized cost.
Loans
The Company’s lending activities are conducted principally in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. The Company grants single- and multi-family residential loans, commercial & industrial (“C&I”), commercial real estate (“CRE”), construction loans, and a variety of consumer loans. Most of the loans granted by the Company are secured by real estate collateral. Repayment of the Company’s residential loans are generally dependent on the health of the employment market in the borrowers’ geographic areas and that of the general economy with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being typically viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. The repayment of C&I loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. As borrower cash flow may be difficult to predict, liquidation of the underlying collateral securing these loans is typically viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. However, collateral typically consists of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets that may fluctuate in value, so the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment. For renewable energy loans, cash flow is generally from multiple revenue sources and dependent on energy output. For PPP loans, the SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount subject to program requirements. The Company’s CRE loans are primarily made based on the cash flow from the collateral property and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower, with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral typically being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. The Company’s construction loans are primarily made based on the borrower’s expected ability to execute and the future completed value of the collateral property, with sale of the underlying real estate collateral typically being viewed as the primary source of repayment.
The following summary shows the composition of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated:
Residential Mortgage. Residential real estate loans held in portfolio amounted to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $381.3 million, or 41.6%, from $917.6 million at December 31, 2019 and consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. The residential mortgage portfolio represented 41% of total loans at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
The average loan balance outstanding in the residential portfolio was $454,000 and the largest individual residential mortgage loan outstanding was $5.9 million as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms.
The Bank offers fixed and adjustable-rate residential mortgage and construction loans with maturities up to 30 years. One-to-four family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” The Bank generally originates and purchases both fixed and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which increased to $510,400 in 2020 from $484,350 in 2019, for one-unit properties. In addition, the Bank also offers loans above conforming lending limits typically referred to as “jumbo” loans and interest only loans. These loans are typically underwritten to jumbo conforming guidelines; however, the Bank may choose to hold a jumbo loan within its portfolio with underwriting criteria that does not exactly match conforming guidelines. The Bank may also, from time to time, purchase residential loans that are either jumbo, conforming, or meet our Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requirements. Purchases have historically been made to satisfy CRA requirements for lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers within the Bank’s CRA Assessment Area.
Generally, our residential construction loans are based on complete value per plans and specifications, with loan proceeds used to construct the house for single family primary residence. Loans are provided for terms up to 12 months during the construction phase, with loan-to-values that generally do not exceed 80% on as complete basis. The loans then convert to permanent financing at terms up to 360 months.
The Company does not offer reverse mortgages, nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation).
Residential real estate loans are originated both for sale to the secondary market, as well as for retention in the Bank’s loan portfolio. The decision to sell a loan to the secondary market or retain within the portfolio is determined based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the Bank’s asset/liability position, the current interest rate environment, and customer preference.
The Company was servicing mortgage loans sold to others without recourse of approximately $188.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $159.6 million at December 31, 2019.
The table below presents residential real estate loan origination activity for the periods indicated:
Loans are sold with servicing retained or released. The table below presents residential real estate loan sale activity for the periods indicated:
Loans sold with the retention of servicing typically result in the capitalization of servicing rights. Loan servicing rights are included in other assets and subsequently amortized as an offset to other income over the estimated period of servicing. The net balance of capitalized servicing rights amounted to $1.2 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Commercial Mortgage. Commercial real estate loans were $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $298.4 million, or 28.1%, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The commercial real estate loan portfolio represented 44% and 48% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average loan balance outstanding in this portfolio was $1.6 million and the largest individual commercial real estate loan outstanding was $27.0 million as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, this commercial mortgage was performing in accordance with its original terms.
CRE loans are secured by a variety of property types inclusive of multi-family dwellings, retail facilities, office buildings, commercial mixed use, lodging, industrial and warehouse properties, and other specialized properties.
Generally, our CRE loans are for terms of up to ten years, with loan-to-values that generally do not exceed 75%. Amortization schedules are long-term, and thus, a balloon payment is generally due at maturity. Under most circumstances, the Bank will offer to rewrite or otherwise extend the loan at prevailing interest rates.
Generally, our commercial construction loans are speculative in nature, with loan proceeds used to acquire and develop real estate property for sale or rental. Loans are provided for terms up to 36 months during the construction phase, with loan-to-values that generally do not exceed 75% on both an “as is” and “as complete and stabilized” basis. Construction projects are primarily for the development of residential property types, inclusive of one-to-four family and multifamily properties.
Home Equity. The home equity portfolio totaled $106.2 million and $80.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The home equity portfolio represented 3% and 4% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the largest home equity line of credit was a $3.5 million line of credit and had an outstanding balance of $3.3 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, this line of credit was performing in accordance with its original terms.
Home equity lines of credit are extended as both first and second mortgages on owner-occupied residential properties in the Bank’s market area. Home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten with the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.
Our home equity lines of credit are revolving lines of credit, which generally have a term between 15 and 20 years, with draws available for the first 10 years. Our 15-year lines of credit are interest only during the first 10 years and amortize on a five-year basis thereafter. Our 20-year lines of credit are interest only during the first 10 years and amortize on a 10-year basis thereafter. We generally originate home equity lines of credit with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan, although loan-to-value ratios may occasionally exceed 80% on a case-by-case basis. Maximum combined loan-to-values are determined based on an applicant’s loan/line amount and the estimated property value. Lines of credit above $1.0 million generally will not exceed combined loan-to-value of 75%. Rates are adjusted monthly based on changes in a designated market index. We also offer home equity term loans, which are extended as second mortgages on owner-occupied residential properties in our market area. Our home equity term loans are fixed rate second mortgage loans, which generally have a term between 5 and 20 years.
Commercial and Industrial (C&I). The commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $347.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $214.6 million, or 161.1%, from $133.2 million at December 31, 2019. C&I loans represented 11% and 6% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average loan balance outstanding in this portfolio was $414,000, excluding PPP loans, and the largest individual commercial and industrial loan outstanding was $8.8 million as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms.
Loans under the SBA’s PPP program totaled $126.2 million at December 31, 2020 and are included in the C&I portfolio.
•
At December 31, 2020, Innovation Banking loans totaled $19.9 million and the average loan balance outstanding in this portfolio was $795,000. The largest individual loan outstanding was $4.7 million and this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2020.
•
At December 31, 2020, asset-based loans totaled $21.2 million and the average loan balance outstanding in this portfolio was $1.5 million. The largest individual loans outstanding was $5.0 million and this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2020.
•
At December 31, 2020, commercial renewable energy loans totaled $89.8 million and the average loan balance outstanding in this portfolio was $2.7 million. The largest individual loan outstanding was $8.8 million, and this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2020.
The Company’s C&I loan customers represent various small- and middle-market established businesses involved in professional services, accommodation and food services, utilities, health care, wholesale trade, manufacturing, distribution, retailing, and non-profits. Most clients are privately owned businesses with markets that range from local to national in scope. Many of the loans to this segment are secured by liens on corporate assets and the personal guarantees of the principals. The Company also makes loans to entrepreneurial and technology businesses, where regional economic strength or weakness impacts the relative risks in this loan category, in addition to renewable energy lending which is more specialized in nature. The Bank has expanded its exposure within renewable energy lending but otherwise there are no significant concentrations in any one business sector, and loan risks are generally diversified among many borrowers.
Consumer Loans. The consumer loan portfolio totaled $41.8 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.1 million, or 20.5%, from $34.7 million at December 31, 2019. Consumer loans represented 1% of the total loan portfolio at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Consumer loans include secured and unsecured loans, lines of credit, and personal installment loans. Unsecured consumer loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner-occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets. The secured consumer loans and lines portfolio are generally fully secured by pledged assets such as bank accounts or investments. The average loan balance outstanding in this portfolio was $14,000 and the largest individual consumer loan outstanding was $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms.
Loan Portfolio Maturities. The following table summarizes the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on their loan type and contractual terms to maturity at December 31, 2020. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less.
Loan Portfolio by Interest Rate Type. The following table summarizes the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on whether the loan has a fixed, adjustable, or floating rate of interest at December 31, 2020:
Nonperforming Loans and TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)
The composition of nonperforming loans is as follows:
Total non-performing loans increased $3.3 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of loans on non-accrual.
The Company continues to closely monitor the portfolio of non-performing loans for which management has concerns regarding the ability of the borrowers to perform. The majority of the loans are secured by real estate and are considered to have adequate collateral value to cover the loan balances at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, although such values may fluctuate with changes in the economy and the real estate market. In addition to the monitoring and review of loan performance internally, the Company has contracted with an independent organization to review the Company’s commercial and CRE loan portfolios. This independent review was performed in each of the past five years.
Non-accrual Loans. Loans are typically placed on non-accrual status when any payment of principal and/or interest is 90 days or more past due unless the collateral is sufficient to cover both principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. The Company monitors closely the performance of its loan portfolio. The status of delinquent loans, as well as situations identified as potential problems, is reviewed on a regular basis by management.
Troubled Debt Restructurings. Loans are considered restructured in a troubled debt restructuring when the Company has granted concessions to a borrower due to the borrower’s financial condition that it otherwise would not have considered. These concessions may include modifications of the terms of the debt such as deferral of payments, extension of maturity, reduction of principal balance, reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments, or a combination of these concessions. Debt may be bifurcated with separate terms for each tranche of the restructured debt. Restructuring a loan in lieu of aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit the Company by increasing the ultimate probability of collection.
Restructured loans are classified as accruing or non-accruing based on management’s assessment of the collectability of the loan. Loans which are already on non-accrual status at the time of the restructuring generally remain on non-accrual status for approximately six months or longer before management considers such loans for return to accruing status. Accruing restructured loans are placed into non-accrual status if and when the borrower fails to comply with the restructured terms and management deems it unlikely that the borrower will return to a status of compliance in the near term. Troubled debt restructurings are individually evaluated for credit losses.
Pursuant to Section 4013 of the CARES Act, financial institutions can suspend the requirements under U.S. GAAP related to TDRs for modifications made before December 31, 2020 to loans that were current as of December 31, 2019. On January 3, 2021, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “Act”). As a result of the Act, the suspension of TDR accounting has been extended to the earlier of January 1, 2022, or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the President terminates. The requirement that a loan be not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 is still applicable. In response to the COVID-19 and its economic impact to customers, a short-term modification program that complies with the CARES Act was implemented to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19. The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are due and payable on the maturity date. Under recently issued guidance, provided these loans were current as of either year end or the date of the modification, these loans are not considered TDR loans at December 31, 2020 and will not be reported as past due during the deferral period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $23.1 million of loans in deferral.
Allowance for CREDIT Losses
The following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the years indicated:
The allowance for credit losses to loans outstanding excluding PPP loans was 1.19% at December 31, 2020.
The level of charge-offs depends on many factors, including the national and regional economy. Cyclical lagging factors may result in charge-offs being higher than historical levels. Although the allowance is allocated between categories, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses attributable to all loan categories. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate.
See additional discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses, in Item 7 under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies” and in Note 7 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sources of Funds
General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our investment and lending activities. The Company also borrows from the FHLB of Boston or the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (“FRB of Boston”), and utilizes brokered deposits to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes, and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled payments and prepayments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities and fee income and proceeds from the sales of loans and securities.
Deposits. The Company accepts deposits primarily from customers in the communities in which our branches and offices are located, as well as from small- and medium-sized businesses and other customers throughout our lending area. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, convenient locations, and client service to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of relationship checking for consumers and businesses, statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, interest on lawyer trust accounts, commercial and regular checking accounts, and individual retirement accounts. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current business strategies, market interest rates, liquidity requirements, and our deposit growth goals. The Bank may also access the brokered deposit market for funding.
At December 31, 2020, we had a total of $223.8 million in certificates of deposit, excluding brokered deposits, of which $185.9 million had remaining maturities of one year or less. Based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, we believe the Bank will retain a large portion of these accounts upon maturity. The Bank had total brokered deposits of $30.8 million, $7.1 million, and $27.5 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
The following table sets forth the Bank’s deposits for the periods indicated:
Retail certificates of deposit of $100,000 or greater by maturity are as follows:
Interest expense on retail certificates of deposit of $100,000 or greater was $126,000 and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table sets forth certificates of deposit classified by interest rate as of the dates indicated:
Borrowings. Total borrowings were $33.0 million, a decrease of $102.7 million as compared to $135.7 million at December 31, 2019. The Company’s borrowings consisted of advances from the FHLB of Boston. FHLB of Boston advances are collateralized by a blanket pledge agreement on the Company’s FHLB of Boston stock and residential mortgages held in the Bank’s portfolios.
The Bank’s remaining borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Boston at December 31, 2020 was approximately $672.7 million. In addition, the Bank has a $10.0 million line of credit with the FHLB of Boston.
The Company had no borrowings outstanding with the FRB Boston at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s remaining borrowing capacity at the FRB Boston at December 31, 2020 was approximately $562.4 million.
See Note 12 - Borrowings, for a schedule, including related interest rates and other information.
Net Interest MargiN
Net interest income represents the difference between interest earned, primarily on loans and investments, and interest paid on funding sources, primarily deposits and borrowings. Interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the amount of net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average rate earned on earning assets is the amount of annualized taxable equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities is equal to annualized interest expense as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities.
The following table sets forth the distribution of the Company’s average assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, and average rates earned or paid on a fully taxable equivalent basis for each of the periods indicated:
(1)
Annualized on a fully taxable equivalent basis calculated using a federal tax rate of 21% for 2020, 2019, and 2018.
(2)
Non-accrual loans are included in average amounts outstanding.
(3)
Average balances of securities available for sale calculated utilizing amortized cost.
(4)
Federal Home Loan Bank stock balance and dividend income is excluded from interest-earning assets.
(5)
Net Interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, inclusive of PPP loans originated during 2020, and the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
(6)
Net interest margin represents net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, inclusive of PPP loans originated during 2020.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company’s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volumes (changes in average balance multiplied by prior year average rate), (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (change in average interest rate multiplied by prior year average balance), and (iii) changes attributable to the combined impact of volumes and rates have been allocated proportionately to separate volume and rate categories.
Excluding the impact of merger-related loan accretion and the impact of PPP loans, the adjusted net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.36%, representing a 14 basis points increase over the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 of 3.22%.
Market Risk and Asset Liability Management
Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company’s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit-taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.
The Company’s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the Company’s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools.
The Company’s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Company’s net interest income and capital, while structuring the Company’s asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The Company relies primarily on its asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk.
Interest Rate Sensitivity. The Company actively manages its interest rate sensitivity position. The objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve sustainable growth in net interest income. The Company’s Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”), using policies and procedures approved by the Company’s board of directors, is responsible for the management of the Company’s interest rate sensitivity position. The Company manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix, pricing, and re-pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities, through the management of its investment portfolio, its offerings of loan and selected deposit terms, and through wholesale funding. Wholesale funding consists of, but is not limited to, multiple sources including borrowings with the FHLB of Boston, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s discount window, and certificates of deposit from institutional brokers.
The Company uses several tools to manage its interest rate risk including interest rate sensitivity analysis, or gap analysis, market value of portfolio equity analysis, interest rate simulations under various rate scenarios, and net interest margin reports. The results of these reports are compared to limits established by the Company’s ALCO policies and appropriate adjustments may be made if the results are outside the established limits.
The following table demonstrates the annualized result of an interest rate simulation (excluding purchase accounting adjustments and PPP fee income) and the estimated effect that a parallel interest rate shift, or “shock,” in the yield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing might have on the Company’s projected net interest income over the next 12 months and 24 months.
As of December 31, 2020:
The following table demonstrates the annualized result of an interest rate simulation (excluding purchase accounting adjustments and PPP fee income) and the estimated effect that a gradual interest rate shift in the yield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing might have on the Company’s projected net interest income over the next 12 months and 24 months.
As of December 31, 2020:
These simulations assume that there is no growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next 12 months and 24 months. The changes to net interest income shown above are in compliance with the Company’s policy guidelines.
Economic Value of Equity Analysis. The Company also analyzes the sensitivity of the Bank’s financial condition to changes in interest rates through our economic value of equity model. This analysis measures the difference between estimated changes in the present value of the Bank’s assets and estimated changes in the present value of the Bank’s liabilities assuming various changes in current interest rates.
The Bank’s economic value of equity analysis as of December 31, 2020 estimated that, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Bank would experience a 9.7% decrease in the economic value of equity for the next 12 months, and a 9.9% increase in the economic value of equity for the next 24 months. At the same date, our analysis estimated that, in the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Bank would experience an 8.0% increase in the economic value of equity over the next 12 months, and an 11.2% increase in the economic value of equity for the next 24 months. The estimates within the economic value of equity calculation are significantly impacted by management’s assumption that the value of non-maturity deposits do not fall below their stated balance as of December 31, 2020. This assumption has the impact of increasing the Bank’s economic value of equity in the falling rate scenario as lower market rates increase the value of the loan and investment portfolios while the value of the non-maturity deposit base remains static. The Company believes retaining customer relationships is the most desirable strategy over the long term.
The estimates of changes in the economic value of our equity require us to make certain assumptions including loan- and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on the economic value of our equity. Although our economic value of equity analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the economic value of our equity and will differ from actual results.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.
Liquidity. Liquidity is defined as the Company’s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its needs for day-to-day operations and material long- and short-term commitments. Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if the Company were unable to meet its funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The Company manages its liquidity based on demand and specific events and uncertainties to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Company’s objective in managing liquidity is to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers, as well as increase to earnings enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace. At December 31, 2020, the Company had access to funds totaling $1.8 billion.
The Company’s liquidity position is managed on a daily basis as part of the daily settlement function and continuously as part of the formal asset liability management process. The Bank’s liquidity is maintained by managing its core deposits as the primary source, selling investment securities, selling loans in the secondary market, borrowing from the FHLB of Boston and the FRB, and purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit as its secondary sources.
The sources of funds for dividends paid by the Company are dividends received from the Bank and liquid funds held by the Company. The Company and the Bank are regulated enterprises and their abilities to pay dividends are subject to regulatory review and restriction. Certain regulatory and statutory restrictions exist regarding dividends, loans, and advances from the Bank to the Company. Generally, the Bank has the ability to pay dividends to the Company subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements.
Quarterly, ALCO reviews the Company’s liquidity needs and reports any findings (if required) to the Board of Directors.
Capital Adequacy. Total shareholders’ equity was $401.7 million at December 31, 2020, as compared to $286.6 million at December 31, 2019. The Company’s equity increased primarily due to net income of $32.0 million, $87.2 million of equity issued as a result of the Wellesley merger, before tax-effect increases in the value of the Company’s interest rate derivative positions of $4.7 million, and before tax-effect increases in unrealized gains on the available for sale investment portfolio of $3.6 million, partially offset by regular dividend payments of $13.1 million paid during the year. The ratio of total equity to total assets was 10.17% and 10.04% at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Book value per share was $58.00 and $53.06, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum levels to be considered “well capitalized.” See Note 18 - Shareholders’ Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of regulatory capital requirements.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingencies
The Company has entered into contractual obligations and commitments. The following tables summarize the Company’s contractual cash obligations and other commitments by maturity at December 31, 2020:
Further discussion regarding commitments and contingencies can be found in Note 16 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK and Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments primarily include commitments to originate and sell loans, standby letters of credit, unused lines of credit, and unadvanced portions of construction loans. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these particular classes of financial instruments.
The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments, standby letters of credit and unadvanced portions of construction loans is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. Our significant off-balance-sheet arrangements consist of the following:
•
commitments to originate and sell loans,
•
standby and commercial letters of credit,
•
unused lines of credit,
•
unadvanced portions of construction loans,
•
unadvanced portions of other loans,
•
loan related derivatives, and
•
risk participation agreements.
Off-balance-sheet arrangements are more fully discussed in Note 16 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
