Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Forward-Looking Statements
This disclosure includes forward-looking statements; and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
Our Business
We market and sell VOIs, manage vacation resorts in top leisure and urban destinations and operate a point-based vacation club. As of December 31, 2020, we have 62 properties, representing 498,524 VOIs, that are primarily located in vacation destinations such as Orlando, Las Vegas, the Hawaiian Islands, New York City, Washington D.C., South Carolina, Barbados and Mexico and feature spacious, condominium-style accommodations with superior amenities and quality service. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 328,000 Hilton Grand Vacations Club and Hilton Club (collectively the “Club”) members. Club members have the flexibility to exchange their VOIs for stays at any Hilton Grand Vacations resort or any property in the Hilton system of 18 industry-leading brands across approximately 6,300 properties, as well as numerous experiential vacation options, such as cruises and guided tours.
On January 3, 2017, Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (“Hilton”) completed a tax-free spin-off of Hilton Grand Vacations (“HGV”) and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (“Park”). As a result of the spin-off, HGV became an independent publicly-traded company and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HGV.” For further details of our history and the development of our business, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We operate our business across two segments: (1) real estate sales and financing; and (2) resort operations and Club management.
Real Estate Sales and Financing
Our primary product is the marketing and selling of fee-simple VOIs deeded in perpetuity and right to use real estate interests, developed either by us or by third parties. This ownership interest is an interest in real estate generally equivalent to one week on an annual basis, at the timeshare resort where the VOI was purchased. Traditionally, timeshare operators have funded 100 percent of the investment necessary to acquire land and construct timeshare properties. We source VOIs through fee-for-service and just-in-time agreements with third-party developers and have focused our inventory strategy on developing an optimal inventory mix focused on developed properties as well as fee-for-service and just-in-time agreements. The fee-for-service agreements enable us to generate fees from the sales and marketing of the VOIs and Club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund acquisition and construction costs. The just-in-time agreements enable us to source VOI inventory in a manner that allows us to correlate the timing of acquisition of the inventory with the sale to purchasers. Sales of owned, including just-in-time inventory, generally result in greater Adjusted EBITDA contributions, while fee-for-service sales require less initial investment and allow us to accelerate our sales growth. Both sales of owned inventory and fee-for-service sales generate long-term, predictable fee streams, by adding to the Club membership base and properties under management, that generate strong returns on invested capital.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales from fee-for-service, just-in-time and developed inventory sources were 52 percent, 25 percent and 23 percent, respectively, of contract sales. See “-Real Estate Sales Metrics” for additional discussion of contract sales. The estimated contract sales value related to our inventory that is currently available for sale at open or soon-to-be open projects and inventory at new or existing projects that will become available for sale in the future upon registration, delivery or construction is approximately $10 billion at
current pricing. Capital efficient arrangements represent approximately 52 percent of that supply. We believe that the visibility into our long-term supply allows us to efficiently manage inventory to meet predicted sales, reduce capital investments, minimize our exposure to the cyclicality of the real estate market and mitigate the risks of entering into new markets.
We sell our vacation ownership products under the Hilton Grand Vacations brand primarily through our distribution network of both in-market and off-sites. Our products are currently marketed for sale throughout the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. We operate sales distribution centers in major markets and popular leisure destinations with year-round demand and a history of being a friendly environment for vacation ownership. We have sales distribution centers in Las Vegas, Orlando, Oahu, Japan, New York, Myrtle Beach, Waikoloa, Washington D.C., Hilton Head, Park City, Chicago, Korea and Carlsbad. Our marketing and sales activities are based on targeted direct marketing and a highly personalized sales approach. We use targeted direct marketing to reach potential members who are identified as having the financial ability to pay for our products and have an affinity with Hilton and are frequent leisure travelers. Tour flow quality impacts key metrics such as VPG, defined in “Key Business and Financial Metrics and Terms Used by Management-Real Estate Sales Metrics.” Additionally, the quality of tour flow impacts sales revenue and the collectability of our timeshare financing receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 62 percent of our contract sales were to our existing owners.
We provide financing for members purchasing our developed and acquired inventory and generate interest income. Our timeshare financing receivables are collateralized by the underlying VOIs and are generally structured as 10-year, fully-amortizing loans that bear a fixed interest rate typically ranging from 4 percent to 18 percent per annum. Financing propensity was 66.5 percent and 66.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We calculate financing propensity as contract sales volume of financed contracts originated in the period divided by contract sales volume of all contracts originated in the period.
The interest rate on our loans is determined by, among other factors, the amount of the down payment, the borrower’s credit profile and the loan term. The weighted-average FICO score for new loans to U.S. and Canadian borrowers at the time of origination were as follows:
Prepayment is permitted without penalty. When a member defaults, we ultimately return their VOI to inventory for resale and that member no longer participates in our Club. Historical default rates, which represent annual defaults as a percentage of each year’s beginning gross timeshare financing receivables balance, were as follows:
(1)
A loan is considered to be in default if it is equal to or greater than 121 days past due as of the prior month end.
Some of our timeshare financing receivables have been pledged as collateral in our securitization transactions, which have in the past and may in the future provide funding for our business activities. In these securitization transactions, special purpose entities are established to issue various classes of debt securities which are generally collateralized by a single pool of assets, consisting of timeshare financing receivables that we service and related cash deposits. For additional information see Note 6: Timeshare Financing Receivables in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on form 10-K.
In addition, we earn fees from servicing the loans provided by third-party developers of our fee-for-service projects to purchasers of their VOIs and from our securitized timeshare financing receivables.
Resort Operations and Club Management
We enter into management agreements with the HOAs of the VOI owners for timeshare resorts developed by us or a third party. Each of the HOAs is governed by a board of directors comprised of owner and developer representatives that are charged with ensuring the resorts are well-maintained and financially stable. Our management services include day-to-day operations of the resorts, maintenance of the resorts, preparation of reports, budgets and projections and employee training and oversight. Our HOA management agreements provide for a cost-plus management fee, which means we generally earn a fee equal to 10 percent to 15 percent of the costs to operate the applicable resort. The fees we earn are highly predictable due to the relatively fixed nature of resort operating expenses and our management fees are unaffected by changes in rental rate or occupancy. We are reimbursed for the costs incurred to perform our services, principally related to personnel providing on-site services. The initial term of our management agreements typically ranges from three to five years and the agreements are subject to periodic renewal for one to three year periods. Many of these agreements renew automatically unless either party provides advance notice of termination before the expiration of the term.
We also manage and operate the points-based Hilton Grand Vacations Club and Hilton Club exchange programs, which provide exclusive exchange, leisure travel and reservation services to our Club members. When owners purchase a VOI, they are generally enrolled in the Club and given an annual allotment of points that allow the member to exchange their annual usage rights in the VOI that they own for a number of vacation and travel options. In addition to an annual membership fee, Club members pay incremental fees depending on exchanges they choose within the Club system.
We rent unsold VOI inventory, third-party inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges through our club programs. We earn a fee from rentals of third-party inventory. Additionally, we provide ancillary offerings including food and beverage, retail and spa offerings at these timeshare properties.
Principal Components and Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Principal Components of Revenues
•
Sales of VOIs, net represents revenue recognized from the sale of owned VOIs, net of amounts considered uncollectible and sales incentives.
•
Sales, marketing, brand and other fees represents sales commissions, brand fees and other fees earned on the sales of VOIs through fee-for-service agreements with third-party developers. All sales commissions and brand fees are based on the total sales price of the VOIs. Also included in Sales, marketing, brand and other fees are revenues from marketing and incentive programs, including redemption of prepaid vacation packages and Club bonus points for stays at HGV properties, which are included in Rental and ancillary services.
•
Financing represents revenue from the financing of sales of our owned intervals, which includes interest income and fees from servicing loans. We also earn fees from servicing the loans provided by third-party developers to purchasers of their VOIs.
•
Resort and club management represents revenues from Club activation fees, annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges. Resort and club management also includes recurring management fees under our agreements with HOAs for day-to-day-management services, including housekeeping services, maintenance, and certain accounting and administrative services for HOAs, generally based on a percentage of costs to operate the resorts.
•
Rental and ancillary services represents revenues from transient rentals of unoccupied vacation ownership units and revenues recognized from the utilization of Club points and vacation packages when points and packages are redeemed for rental stays at one of our resorts. We also earn fees from the rental of inventory owned by third parties. Ancillary revenues include food and beverage, retail, spa offerings and other guest services provided to resort guests.
•
Cost reimbursements include costs that HOAs and developers reimburse to us. These costs primarily consist of payroll and payroll-related costs for management of the HOAs and other services we provide where we are the employer and insurance. The corresponding expenses are presented as Cost reimbursements expense in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on net income.
Factors Affecting Revenues
•
Relationships with developers. In recent years, we have entered into fee-for-service and just-in-time agreements to sell VOIs on behalf of or acquired from third-party developers. The success and sustainability of our capital-efficient business model depends on our ability to maintain good relationships with third-party developers. Our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth. We believe that we have strong relationships with our third-party developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. These relationships exist with a diverse group of developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party.
•
Construction activities. In recent years, we have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire both completed VOIs and property. At the same time, we have increased our own development activities to construct new properties that we will own and from which we are selling, and will continue to sell, units and VOIs. These activities, and in particular the development of real property into inventory, are subject to construction risks including, construction delays, zoning and other local, state or governmental approvals and failure by third-party contractors to perform. The realization of these factors could result in the inability to source inventory and ultimately lead to sales declines.
•
Registration activities. The registration of VOIs for sale requires time and cost, and in many jurisdictions the exact date of registration approval cannot be predicted accurately. The inability to register our products in a timely, cost-effective fashion could result in the inability to sell our products and ultimately lead to sales declines.
•
Relationship with Hilton. Following the spin-off, Hilton retained ownership of the Hilton-branded trademarks, tradenames and certain related intellectual property used in the operation of our business. We entered into a license agreement with Hilton granting us the right to use the Hilton-branded trademarks, trade names and related intellectual property in our business for the term of the agreement. The termination of the license agreement or exercise of other remedies would materially harm our business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our products and maintain our competitive position. For example, if we are not able to rely on the strength of the Hilton brands to attract prospective members and guest tours in the marketplace, our revenue would decline and our marketing and sales expenses would increase.
•
Consumer demand and global economic conditions. Consumer demand for our products and services may be affected by the performance of the general economy, including the ability to generate high quality tours, and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatility.
•
Marketing. We rely on call transfers from Hilton, execution of a successful digital marketing strategy, vacation traffic at key locations, and other critical marketing elements to increase tour flow, VPG, and VOI sales, thereby increasing our revenue. Any significant changes to one or more factors that adversely affect our marketing activities, such as changes in consumer behavior and preference for vacations, decreases in call transfers from Hilton due to increasing consumer reliance on digital tools, and declining quality and/or volume of tour flow may adversely and materially impact our revenue.
•
Interest rates. We generate interest income from consumer loans we originate and declines in interest rates may cause us to lower our interest rates on our originated loans, which would adversely affect our income generated on future loans. Conversely, if interest rates increase significantly, it would increase the cost of purchasing VOIs for any purchaser who is financing their acquisition and may deter potential purchasers from buying a VOI, which could result in sales declines.
•
Competition. We compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of VOIs based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, reservation systems and flexibility for VOI owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards. In addition, we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation. Our primary branded competitors in the timeshare space include Marriott Vacations Worldwide (which includes Marriott Vacations Worldwide, Interval Leisure Group, Vistana Signature Club and Hyatt Residence Club brands), Wyndham Destinations, Disney Vacation Club, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, Bluegreen Vacations and Diamond Resorts International.
Principal Components of Expenses
•
Cost of VOI sales represents the costs attributable to the sales of owned VOIs recognized, as well as charges incurred related to granting credit to customers for their existing ownership when upgrading into fee-for-service projects.
•
Sales and marketing represents costs incurred to sell and market VOIs, including costs incurred relating to marketing and incentive programs, costs for tours, rental expense and wages and sales commissions.
•
Financing represents consumer financing interest expense related to our debt securitized by gross timeshare financing receivables (‘‘Securitized Debt”) and Timeshare Facility, amortization of the related deferred loan costs and other expenses incurred in providing consumer financing and servicing loans.
•
Resort and club management represents costs incurred to manage resorts and the Club, including payroll and related costs and other administrative costs.
•
Rental and ancillary services include payroll and related costs, costs incurred from participating in the Hilton Honors loyalty program, retail, food and beverage costs and maintenance fees on unsold inventory.
•
General and administrative consists primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments, professional fees (including consulting, audit and legal fees), administrative and related expenses. General and administrative also includes costs for services provided to us by Hilton.
•
Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings and leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment at our sales centers, corporate offices, and assets purchased for future conversion to inventory, as well as amortization of our management agreement intangible and capitalized software.
•
License fee expense represents the royalty fee paid to Hilton under a license agreement for the exclusive right to use the Hilton Grand Vacations mark, which is generally based on a percentage of gross sales volume, of certain revenue streams.
•
Cost reimbursements include costs that HOAs and developers reimburse to us. These costs primarily consist of payroll and payroll-related costs for management of the HOAs and other services we provide where we are the employer and insurance. The corresponding revenues are presented as Cost reimbursements revenue in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on net income.
Factors Affecting Expenses
•
Costs of VOI sales. In periods where there is increased demand for VOIs, we may incur increased costs to acquire inventory in the short-term, which can have an adverse effect on our cash flows, margins and profits. In addition, the registration of inventory for sale requires time and cost, and in many jurisdictions the exact date of registration approval cannot be predicted accurately. As we encourage owners to upgrade into other products, we incur expenses when owners upgrade from an interval in a project we developed into fee-for-service projects, on which we earn fees. In periods where more upgrades are occurring and we are not generating increased sales volume on unsold supply, we could see an adverse effect on our cash flows, margins and profits.
Furthermore, construction delays, zoning and other local, state or federal governmental approvals, particularly in new geographic areas with which we are unfamiliar, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural or man-made disasters, as well as failure by third-party contractors to perform for any reason, could lead to an adverse effect on our cash flows, margins and profits.
•
Sales and marketing expense. A significant portion of our costs relates to selling and marketing of our VOIs. In periods of decreased demand for VOIs, we may be unable to reduce our sales and marketing expenses quickly enough to prevent a deterioration of our profits and margins on our real estate operations.
•
Rental and ancillary services expense. These expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. We pay a portion of these costs through maintenance fees of unsold intervals and by subsidizing the costs of HOAs not covered by maintenance fees collected. If we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our unit rentals decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues could have an adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins and profits.
•
General and administrative. Increases in general and administrative expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company in a competitive and dynamic timeshare industry, regulatory filings and professional fees may affect our net cash flows, margins and profits.
•
Interest rates. Increases in interest rates would increase the consumer financing interest expense we pay on the Timeshare Facility and could adversely affect our financing operations in future securitization or other debt transactions, affecting net cash flow, margins and profits.
Other Items
•
Seasonality. We experience modest seasonality in VOI sales at certain resorts, with increased revenue during traditional vacation periods for those locations.
•
Regulation. Our business activities are highly regulated. We are subject to a wide variety of complex international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws, regulations and policies primarily affect four areas of our business: real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; lending activities; and resort management activities. We seek to actively participate in the determination of new laws or other regulations affecting the timeshare industry. For further detail of these regulations see “Risk Factors” and “Business-Government Regulation” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Key Business and Financial Metrics and Terms Used by Management
Real Estate Sales Operating Metrics
We measure our performance using the following key operating metrics:
•
Contract sales represents the total amount of VOI products (fee-for-service and developed) under purchase agreements signed during the period where we have received a down payment of at least 10 percent of the contract price. Contract sales differ from revenues from the Sales of VOIs, net that we report in our consolidated statements of operations due to the requirements for revenue recognition, as well as adjustments for incentives. We consider contract sales to be an important operating measure because it reflects the pace of sales in our business and is used to manage the performance of the sales organization. While we do not record the purchase price of sales of VOI products developed by fee-for-service partners as revenue in our consolidated financial statements, rather recording the commission earned as revenue in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe contract sales to be an important operational metric, reflective of the overall volume and pace of sales in our business and believe it provides meaningful comparability of our results to the results of our competitors which may source their VOI products differently.
We believe that the presentation of contract sales on a combined basis (fee-for-service and developed) is most appropriate for the purpose of the operating metric, additional information regarding the split of contract sales, is included in “-Real Estate” below. See Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on form 10-K, for additional information on Sales of VOI, net.
•
Sales revenue represents Sale of VOIs, net and commissions and brand fees earned from the sale of fee-for-service intervals.
•
Real estate profit represents sales revenue less the cost of VOI sales and sales and marketing costs, net of marketing revenue. Real estate profit margin is calculated by dividing real estate profit by sales revenue. We consider this to be an important operating measure because it measures the efficiency of our sales and marketing spending and management of inventory costs.
•
Tour flow represents the number of sales presentations given at our sales centers during the period.
•
Volume per guest (“VPG”) represents the sales attributable to tours at our sales locations and is calculated by dividing Contract sales, excluding telesales, by tour flow. We consider VPG to be an important operating measure because it measures the effectiveness of our sales process, combining the average transaction price with the closing rate.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA, presented herein, is a financial measure that is not recognized under U.S. GAAP that reflects net income (loss), before interest expense (excluding non-recourse debt), a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA, presented herein, is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including, but not limited to, gains, losses and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings/retirements; (iv) non-cash impairment losses; (v) reorganization costs, including severance and relocation costs; (vi) share-based and certain other compensation expenses; (vii) costs related to the spin-off; and (viii) other items.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense (excluding interest expense on non-recourse debt), or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness;
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations;
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for future replacements of assets that are being depreciated and amortized; and
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be calculated differently from other companies in our industry limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.
Recent Events Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Impact on Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition, and Business During the Year Ended December 31, 2020.
In March 2020, a National Public Health Emergency was declared in response to the coronavirus, known as COVID-19. As a result, many local, county and state government officials have issued, and continue to issue, various mandates and orders to close non-essential businesses, impose travel restrictions, and require “stay-at-home” and/or self-quarantine in certain cases, all in an effort to protect the health and safety of individuals and aimed at slowing and ultimately stopping the spread and transmission of the virus. Accordingly, commencing in March 2020, we started to temporarily close substantially all of our properties and suspended our U.S sales operations and closed such sales offices. We took a number of other actions to reduce our expenses and preserve liquidity, including workforce furlough, implementing salary reductions for the remaining active employees primarily during the second quarter of 2020, implementing hiring freezes, eliminating all discretionary spending, and reducing our planned investment in new inventory by approximately $200 million. Recently, we completed a workforce reduction plan that impacted approximately 1,500 team members in order to better align our workforce with the Company’s needs in light of the environment, and approximately 1,800 of our team members remain furloughed.
Furthermore, we believe the following actions will provide adequate capital to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements for anticipated operating expenses and other expenditures, including payroll and related benefits, legal costs, and additional costs related to complying with various regulatory requirements and best practices for opening under the current environment resulting from the pandemic, and to finance our long-term growth plan and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
• In March 2020, we drew down the substantial remainder of our borrowing capacity under our revolver facility through net borrowings of $445 million as a precautionary measure to ensure liquidity for a sustained period in the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect the proceeds would be used for general corporate and working capital purposes in the ordinary course of business.
• In April 2020, we amended certain key definitions related to delinquency level calculations of underlying timeshare loans that are used as collateral for borrowings under our Timeshare Facility, and generated added flexibility to manage any potential increase in the rate of delinquency as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
• In May 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement which amended certain terms of the credit facilities (“Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) to provide us with both near-term and long-term flexibility with respect to satisfying certain negative and financial covenants and ratios as may be needed due to the ongoing and uncertain future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations.
• In June 2020, we completed a securitization of $300 million of gross timeshare financing receivables and used the proceeds to pay down the $195 million outstanding balance on our Timeshare Facility and for general corporate operating expenses. As of December 31, 2020, we have $450 million remaining borrowing capacity under our Timeshare Facility.
• In August 2020, we renewed and extended our Timeshare Facility and amended certain provisions relating to advance rate, successor benchmark interest rate, certain used and unused fees, and thresholds for interest rate hedging obligations and transactions.
• In December 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement which provided a waiver period for certain financial covenants for the first three quarters of 2021. In connection with the Amendment we incurred $1 million in debt issuance costs. We also amended the Timeshare Facility to update the definition of seller financial covenants to be consistent with the amended Credit Agreement.
Refer to Note 15: Debt and Non-Recourse Debt in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt.
The closure of our resorts and sales centers, and the related suspensions of our operations, expectedly have had a materially adverse impact on our revenues, net (loss) income and other operating results during the fourth quarter, as well as our business and operations generally, as more fully discussed below. As discussed in further detail below, substantially all of the unfavorable changes in our operating results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to prior periods were a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, along with the temporary closure of substantially all of our properties and suspension of our sales and related operations during the first half of 2020.
Outlook
The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented and challenging time. Our current focus is on taking critical actions that are aimed at positioning the Company in a sound position from an operational, liquidity, credit access, and compliance perspective for a strong recovery when the impact of COVID-19 subsides. As discussed above, we have taken several steps to enhance our liquidity, preserve cash, reduce our expenditures and provide financial flexibility. We will continue to assess the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, including the various government mandates and orders that impact the re-opening of our properties and any new recommended or required business practices, and will take additional actions as appropriate.
Prior to reopening our resorts and sales centers, we introduced the HGV Enhanced Care Guidelines, designed to provide owners, guests and team members with the highest level of cleaning protocols and safety standards recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and cleaning solutions approved by the Environmental Protection Agency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with providing personal protective equipment to team members, these Enhanced Care Guidelines include low touch arrivals and departures, frequent and thorough cleaning, reduction of paper items, reduced capacity for our pool decks and fitness centers, and new technologies. While operations were suspended, essential resort personnel worked diligently maintaining the resorts for a safe re-opening. Annual deep cleanings, typically scheduled during slower seasons, were moved up and completed, allowing the resorts to be in top shape when owners and guests arrive.
Beginning in May 2020, various states and counties started to allow gradual relaxation of restrictions on activities and a resumption of businesses. In response, we began a phased reopening of resorts and resumption of our business activities during the second quarter of 2020, but under new operating guidelines and with safety measures. As of December 2020, approximately 85% of our resorts and sales centers are open and currently operating however, many of our resorts and sales centers are operating in markets with significant capacity constraints and various safety measures.
Although we have started re-opening our sales centers, they have initially been operating at lower levels of utilization than they were prior to the temporary shutdown. This includes lower levels of sales staff, modified operating schedules to stagger tours in compliance with social distancing rules, and running a reduced weekly operating calendar. As we respond to changes in tour flow, we intend to adjust our sales operations accordingly while complying with all applicable social distancing rules and our own safety measures.
While we plan to continue to reopen our resorts and resume our business as conditions and applicable rules and regulations permit, the pandemic continues to be unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown duration and severity. Further, ongoing strict travel and other restrictions in regions and locations where we have a significant concentration of our properties and units, in particular, Hawaii and New York, are significantly impacting consumer demand for our resorts in those areas.
Accordingly, there remains significant uncertainty as to the degree of impact and duration of the conditions stemming from the ongoing pandemic on our revenues, net income and other operating results, as well as our business and operations generally. Any significantly extended duration or worsening of the conditions associated with the pandemic may adversely impact our liquidity in the longer term, including our ability to finance our day-to-day business and operations, and may adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants under our debt obligations notwithstanding the recent amendments discussed above.
Please carefully review the risk factors contained in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for discussions of various factors and uncertainties related to the pandemic that may materially impact us.

Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
(2)
In the first quarter 2020, we determined that the performance conditions for our 2018, 2019, and 2020 Performance RSUs were improbable of achievement. Therefore, we reversed $8 million of share-based compensation expense recognized in prior years and ceased accruing expenses related to Performance RSUs granted in 2018, 2019, and 2020. In December 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation Committee”) approved an amendment to the 2018 Performance RSUs. As a result of the amendment, we recognized compensation expense of $2 million based on the number of Performance RSUs vested and the performance conditions for the 2018 Performance RSU awards.
(3)
In the fourth quarter 2020, we performed a review over certain of our long-lived assets and committed to a plan to monetize and dispose of certain assets via a sale. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the identified assets. The non-cash impairment charge was comprised of a $201 million charge related to Land and infrastructure held for sale and an $8 million charge related to Property and equipment, respectively. See Note 7: Inventory and Note 8: Property and equipment for more information.

Adjusts for segment related share-based compensation, depreciation and other adjustment items, such as spin related costs and restructuring costs.
Real Estate Sales and Financing
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”), revenue and the related costs to fulfill and acquire the contract (“direct costs”) from sales of VOIs under construction are deferred until the point in time when construction activities are deemed to be completed. The real estate sales and financing segment is impacted by construction related deferral and recognition activity. In periods where Sales of VOIs and related direct costs of projects under construction are deferred, profit margins will generally contract as the indirect marketing and selling costs associated with these sales are recognized as incurred in the current period. In periods where previously deferred Sales of VOIs and related direct costs are recognized upon construction completion, profit margins will generally expand as the indirect marketing and selling costs associated with these sales were recognized in prior periods.
The following table represents deferrals and recognitions of Sales of VOI revenue and direct costs for properties under construction:
(1)
Includes anticipated Cost of VOI Sales of VOIs under construction that will be acquired under a just-in-time arrangement once construction is complete for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Real estate sales and financing segment revenues decreased by $758 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to decreases in sales revenue and marketing revenue as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, along with the temporary closure of substantially all of our properties and suspension of our sales and related operations during the first half of 2020.
Real estate sales and financing Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $292 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the decreases in segment revenues associated with segment performance discussed herein partially offset by a decrease in related expenses. In addition, real estate sales and financing segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $7 million in one-time payroll related expenses, net of an employee retention credit granted primarily under the CARES Act, primarily related to payments made to employees as a result of operational closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Refer to “-Real Estate” and “-Financing” for further discussion on the revenues and expenses of the real estate sales and financing segment.
Resort Operations and Club Management
Resort operations and club management segment revenues decreased $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to decreases in rental and ancillary revenues as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, along with the temporary closure of substantially all of our properties and suspension of our sales and related operations during the first half of 2020.
Resort operations and club management segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the decreases in segment profit associated with segment performance discussed herein.
Refer to “-Resort and Club Management” and “-Rental and Ancillary Services” for further discussion on the revenues and expenses of the resort operations and club management segment.
Real Estate Sales and Financing Segment
Real Estate
(1)
Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
(2)
Represents contract sales from fee-for-service properties on which we earn commissions and brand fees.
(3)
Represents the net impact of deferred revenues related to the Sales of VOIs under construction that are recognized when construction is complete.
(4)
Includes adjustments for revenue recognition, including amounts in rescission and sales incentives.
Contract sales decreased $882 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in tour flow related to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, along with the temporary closure of substantially all of our properties and suspension of our sales and related operations during the first half of 2020.
Beginning in May 2020, we began a phased reopening of resorts and resumption of our business activities, however many of our resorts and sales centers are operating in markets with significant capacity constraints and various safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 85 percent of our resorts and sales centers open and currently operating.
(1)
Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
(2)
Includes revenue recognized through our marketing programs for existing owners and prospective first-time buyers and revenue associated with sales incentives, title service and document compliance.
Sales revenue decreased by $674 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due to decrease in sales of VOI revenue, commissions and brand fees and related expenses as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, along with the temporary closure of substantially all of our properties and suspension of our sales and related operations during the first half of 2020. Cost of VOI sales, and sales and marketing expense, net, and real estate (loss) profit decreased consistent with sales revenue decrease because of COVID-19 and our closures referenced herein.
Financing
Financing revenue decreased $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the timeshare financing receivables portfolio balance. This was offset by an increase in the related weighted average interest rate. The weighted average interest rate increased to 12.61 percent from 12.49 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Financing expense remained flat year over year.
Financing profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 related to the aforementioned decrease in interest income.
Resort and Club Management
Resort and club management revenues decreased $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in club management revenue related to the refunding and waiving of club transaction fees to accommodate our guests impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by (i) an increase of approximately 2,000 Club members and (ii) an increase in resort management revenue from the opening of new properties, compared to the same period in 2019.
Resort and club management profit margin increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a reduction in resort and club management expenses driven by the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, along with the temporary closure of substantially all of our resort operations during the first half of 2020.
Rental and Ancillary Services
(1)
Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
Rental and ancillary services revenues, expenses, and profit margin decreased for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, along with the temporary closure of substantially all of our resort operations during the first half of 2020.
Beginning in May 2020, we began a phased reopening of resorts and resumption of our business activities; however, many of our resorts are operating in markets with significant capacity constraints and various safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 85 percent of our resorts open and currently operating.
Other Operating Expenses
(1)
Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
The change in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to the one-time non-cash charge of impairment expense recorded in December 2020 related to undeveloped land and unallocated infrastructure held for sale and held for use. See Note 7: Inventory and Note 8: Property and equipment for additional information regarding the assets held for sale. This increase in impairment expense was offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses related to decreases in salaries and wages from the furloughs and pay decreases announced during the second quarter of 2020 and lower license fee expense related to decreases in real estate sales and resort operations revenue.
Non-Operating Expenses
(1)
Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
The change in non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to a $136 million decrease in income tax expense driven by reduced pre-tax income as a result of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above, in addition to gains associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our cash management objectives are to maintain the availability of liquidity, minimize operational costs, make debt payments and fund future acquisitions and development projects. Our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures, including payroll and related benefits, legal costs, operating costs associated with the operation of our resorts and sales centers, interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, inventory-related purchase commitments, and capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our offices and sales centers. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities, inventory-related purchase commitments and costs associated with potential acquisitions and development projects.
We finance our short- and long-term liquidity needs primarily through cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our operations, draws on our senior secured credit facility and our non-recourse revolving timeshare credit facility (“Timeshare Facility”), and through periodic securitizations of our timeshare financing receivables.
•
In March 2020, we drew down the substantial remainder of our borrowing capacity under the revolver facility through net borrowings of $445 million as a precautionary measure to ensure liquidity for a sustained period in the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not have a plan for the use of the proceeds other than for general corporate and working capital purposes in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2020, we have $139 million remaining borrowing capacity under the revolver facility (“Revolver”).
•
In April 2020, we amended certain key definitions related to delinquency level calculations of underlying timeshare loans that are used as collateral for borrowings under our Timeshare Facility, and generated added flexibility to manage any potential increase in the rate of delinquency as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
•
In May 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement which amended certain terms of the credit facilities (“Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) to provide us with both near-term and long-term flexibility with respect to satisfying certain negative and financial covenants and ratios as may be needed due to the ongoing and uncertain future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations.
•
In June 2020, we completed a securitization of $300 million of gross timeshare financing receivables and used the proceeds to pay down the $195 million outstanding balance on our Timeshare Facility and for general corporate operating expenses. As of December 31, 2020, we have $450 million remaining borrowing capacity under our Timeshare Facility.
•
In August 2020, we renewed and extended our Timeshare Facility and amended certain provisions relating to advance rate, successor benchmark interest rate, certain used and unused fees, and thresholds for interest rate hedging obligations and transactions.
•
In December 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement which provided a waiver period for certain financial covenants for the first three quarters of 2021. In connection with the Amendment we incurred $1 million in debt issuance costs. We also amended the Timeshare Facility to update the definition of seller financial covenants to be consistent with the amended Credit Agreement.
•
As of December 31, 2020, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $526 million, including $98 million of restricted cash. The restricted cash balance relates to escrowed cash from our sales of our VOIs and reserves related to our non-recourse debt.
To optimize our liquidity and access to capital in light of the significant adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as substantially all of our properties were temporarily closed and substantially all of our sales, operations and other activities were suspended during the first and second quarter of 2020, in addition to the steps discussed above, we have undertaken efforts to increase our capital and decrease our expenses. These include workforce furloughs, temporary salary reductions for employees primarily during the second quarter of 2020, eliminating discretionary spending, and reducing our planned investment in new inventory by approximately $200 million. We have also suspended the share repurchase program that was initially authorized by our Board in March 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we executed a workforce reduction plan which resulted in the reduction of our workforce by approximately 1,500 team members.
We utilize surety bonds related to the sales of VOIs in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states. The availability, terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating. We have commitments from surety providers in the amount of $366 million as of December 31, 2020 which primarily consist of escrow and construction related bonds.
We believe that these actions, together with drawing on available borrowings under our Revolver and preserving our capacity under our Timeshare Facility as described above, will provide adequate capital to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements for operating expenses and other expenditures, including payroll and related benefits, legal costs, and additional costs related to complying with various regulatory requirements and best practices for opening under the current environment resulting from the pandemic, and to finance our long-term growth plan and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
In addition, as noted previously, beginning in May 2020, in response to various states and counties starting to allow gradual relaxation of restrictions on activities and a resumption of businesses, we began a phased reopening of resorts and resumption of our business activities, including our sales activities. However, we are operating under new guidelines and with safety measures that did not exist prior to the onset of the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 85 percent of our resorts and sales centers open and currently operating; however, many of our resorts and sales centers were operating with significant capacity constraints and are still subject to various safety measures. While we plan to continue to reopen our resorts and resume our business as conditions permit, the pandemic continues to be unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown duration and severity. Any significantly extended duration or worsening of the conditions associated with the pandemic may adversely impact our liquidity in the longer term, including our ability to finance our day-to-day business and operations, and may adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants under our debt obligations notwithstanding the recent amendments discussed above.
We believe that our capital allocation strategy provides adequate funding for our operations, is flexible enough to fund our development pipeline, securitizes the optimal level of receivables, and provides the ability to be strategically opportunistic in the marketplace. We have made commitments with developers to purchase vacation ownership units at a future date to be marketed and sold under our Hilton Grand Vacations brand. As of December 31, 2020, our inventory-related purchase commitments totaled $454 million over 10 years.
Sources and Uses of Our Cash
The following table summarizes our net cash flows and key metrics related to our liquidity:
Operating Activities
Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities is primarily generated from (i) sales and financing of VOIs and (ii) net cash generated from managing our resorts, Club operations and providing related rental and ancillary services. Cash flows used in operating activities primarily include spending for the acquisition of inventory, development of new phases of existing resorts and funding our working capital needs. Our cash flows provided by operations generally vary due to the following factors related to the sale of our VOIs; the degree to which our owners finance their purchase and our owners’ repayment of timeshare financing receivables; the timing of management and sales and marketing services provided; and cash outlays for real estate to be converted to inventory in the future. Additionally, cash flow provided by operations will also vary depending upon our sales mix of VOIs; over time, we generally receive more cash from the sale of an owned VOI as compared to that from a fee-for-service sale.
The change in net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to decreased sources of cash from working capital as a result of the on-going pandemic partially offset by a reduction in purchases and development of real estate for future conversion to inventory.
The following table exhibits our VOI inventory spending for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(1)
Includes expense related to granting credit to customers for their existing ownership when upgrading into fee-for-service projects of $9 million, $31 million and $34 million recorded in Costs of VOI sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Investing Activities
The following table summarizes our net cash used in investing activities:
Our capital expenditures include spending related to technology and buildings and leasehold improvements used to support sales and marketing locations, resort operations and corporate activities. We believe the renovations of our existing assets are necessary to stay competitive in the markets in which we operate.
The change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was due to a decrease in spend for property and equipment in the current year.
Financing Activities
The following table summarizes our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities:
The change in net cash flows provided by financing activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 is primarily due to the decrease of repayment of debt and decrease in repurchase of common stock in 2020.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
(1)
Includes interest on our debt and non-recourse debt. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed a constant 30-day LIBOR rate of 0.14 percent, subject to a 0.25 percent floor, as of December 31, 2020.
(2)
Primarily relates to commitments related to information technology and brand licensing under the normal course of business.
We have made commitments with developers to purchase vacation ownership units at a future date to be marketed and sold under our Hilton Grand Vacations brand. As of December 31, 2020, our inventory-related purchase commitments totaled $454 million over 10 years.
We utilize surety bonds related to the sales of VOIs in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states. The availability, terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating. We have commitments from surety providers in the amount of $366 million as of December 31, 2020 which primarily consist of escrow and construction related bonds.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020, consisted of $454 million of certain commitments with developers whereby we have committed to purchase vacation ownership units at a future date to be marketed and sold under our Hilton Grand Vacations brand and $20 million of other commitments under the normal course of business. The ultimate amount and timing of the acquisitions is subject to change pursuant to the terms of the respective arrangements, which could also allow for cancellation in certain circumstances, see Note 23: Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Guarantor Financial Information
Certain subsidiaries, which are listed on Exhibit 22 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have guaranteed our obligations related to our senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”). The notes were issued in November 2016 with an aggregate principal balance of $300 million, an interest rate of 6.125 percent, and maturity in December 2024.
Our senior unsecured notes were co-issued by Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower LLC and Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower Inc. (the “Issuers”) and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by HGV (the “Parent”), Hilton Grand Vacations Parent LLC (the “Intermediate Parent”), the Issuers, and each of the Issuer’s existing and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (all entities that guarantee the Notes, collectively, the “Obligor group”).
The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured obligations, are senior in right of payment to any of our guarantor’s subordinated indebtedness, and are subordinate to all existing and future liabilities of our entities that do not guarantee the Notes and our secured indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities and securitized non-recourse debt.
The guarantee of each guarantor subsidiary is limited to a maximum amount, subject to applicable U.S. and non-U.S. laws. The guarantees can also be released upon the sale or transfer of a guarantor subsidiary’s capital stock or substantially all of its assets, becoming designated as an unrestricted subsidiary, or upon its consolidation into a co-Issuer or another subsidiary guarantor.
The following tables provide summarized financial information of the Obligor group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the Parent and the subsidiary guarantors and (ii) investments in and equity in the earnings of non-guarantor subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates:
Subsequent Events
Management has evaluated all subsequent events through March 1, 2021, the date the audited consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. The results of management’s analysis indicated no significant subsequent events have occurred that require considerations adjustments to our disclosures in the audited financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment, and the estimates required to be made are based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain. As a result, these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances. While we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. To achieve the core principle of the guidance, we take the following steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) determine whether the promised goods or services are separate performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including considering the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract based on the standalone selling price or estimated standalone selling price of the good or service; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. For arrangements that contain multiple goods or services, we determine whether such goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately in the arrangement. When allocating the transaction price in the arrangement, we may not have observable standalone sales for all the performance obligations in these contracts; therefore, we exercise significant judgement when determining the standalone selling price of certain performance obligations. In order to estimate the standalone selling prices, we primarily rely on the expected cost plus margin and adjusted market assessment approaches. We then recognize the revenue allocated to each performance obligation as the related performance obligation is satisfied. See Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Inventory and Cost of Sales
We use the relative sales value method of costing our VOI sales and relieving inventory, which requires us to make estimates subject to significant uncertainty. The estimates include future sales prices, timing and volume, provisions for financing receivables losses on financed sales of VOIs, sales incentives, projected future cost and volume of recoveries, including inventory reacquired from our upgrade programs. We aggregate these factors to calculate total net cost of sales of VOIs as a percentage of net sales of VOIs and apply this ratio to allocate the cost of sales to recognized sales of VOIs. The effect of changes in these estimates over the life of a project are recognized on a retrospective basis through corresponding adjustments to inventory and cost of sales in the period in which the estimates are revised.
Due to the application of the retrospective adjustments, changes in any of our estimates, including changes in our development and sales strategies could have a material effect on the carrying value of certain projects and inventory. We monitor our projects and inventory on an ongoing basis and complete an evaluation each reporting period to ensure that the inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. In addition, we continually assess our VOI inventory and, if necessary, impose pricing adjustments to modify sales pace.
Long-lived Assets and Related Impairment
We evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment if there are indicators of potential impairment. We perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset’s carrying value by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset, we calculate the asset’s fair value. The impairment loss recognized is equal to the amount that the net book value is in excess of fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using valuation techniques that consider the discounted cash flows of the asset using discount and capitalization rates deemed reasonable for the type of asset, as well as prevailing market conditions, appraisals, recent similar transactions in the market and, if appropriate and available, current estimated net sales proceeds from
pending offers. We review all finite life intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations.
We classify long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period (i) we have approved and committed to a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to sell the asset have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the asset is probable, (v) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (vi) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. We initially measure a long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. We assess the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to sell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale. The methodology utilized to determine fair value at the time of classification as held for sale is dependent on the type of long-lived asset reclassified. All methodologies utilized to determine fair value involve judgment. In the current year, certain parcels of undeveloped land and unallocated infrastructure were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2020. We utilized the market approach for the undeveloped land and cost approach for unallocated infrastructure to determine their respective fair values. The fair value calculations are sensitive to key assumptions utilized, including comparative sales for undeveloped land and replacement costs for unallocated infrastructure. We also estimated the costs to sell the assets; however, these estimates do not involve significant judgment.
Allowance for Financing Receivables Losses
The allowance for financing receivables losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of VOI sales, which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties. We determine our financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our financing receivables. The adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment, such as current economic conditions and industry trends, as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio, including historic and assumed default rates.
Changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance. A 0.5 percentage point increase to our projected default rates used in the allowance calculation would increase our allowance for financing receivables losses by approximately $8 million.
Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. We regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. In performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. A change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
We use a prescribed more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. Assumptions and estimates are used to determine the more-likely-than-not designation. Changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax (expense) benefit, which can materially change our consolidated financial statements.
Legal Contingencies
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required when we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
