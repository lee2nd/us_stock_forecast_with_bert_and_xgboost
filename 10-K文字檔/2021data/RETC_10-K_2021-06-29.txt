ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. References in the following discussion and throughout this annual report to “we”, “our”, “us”, “12 ReTech Corporation”, “12 ReTech”, “RETC”, “the Company”, and similar terms refer to, 12 ReTech Corporation. unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 12 ReTech Corporation actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this filing.
Company
ReTech Corporation is a holding company with subsidiaries that develop, sell, and install software that we believe enhance the shopping experience for shoppers and retailers. As a holding company, we also acquire synergistic operating companies that manufacture and sell Fashion products to other retailers as well as selling products online. In October 2019 we also acquired retail stores in airport terminals and casinos to create a true Omni-Channel retailer. The plan was this would allow us to deploy our cutting-edge software in the United States to demonstrate its effectiveness, as well as to test, real time new software products to continue to delight consumers and generate additional revenue and profits for retailers.
During the 4th quarter 2019 and continuing in the first quarter 2020 and with the effects of the pandemic created by COVID-19, the Company consolidated operations around two operating entities; 12 Tech, Inc., formed in Arizona on December 26, 2019 (“12 Tech”) and 12 Retail Corporation, formed on June 27th, 2017 (“12 Retail”).
Retail is itself divided into three operating units; 12 Retail, Bluwire Group, LLC (“Bluwire”) that will operate our airport retail stores in airports, 12 Retail itself which will operate our casino store(s), and 12 Fashion Group, Inc. that operates our fashion wholesale and direct to consumer brands, including Rune NYC, Social Sunday, Red Wire Design, Emotion Fashion Group. 12 Retail will serve to demonstrate the effectiveness of the software technology created by 12 Tech in improving revenues and profits for emailers as well as providing access to other retailers through our whole fashion business relationships.
Tech, Inc, provides technology solutions to physical retailers currently mainly in Asia and is now positioned in the United States market, the world’s largest. We have consolidated or shuttered our international units focused on our technology deployment (“12 Japan” and “12 Europe”), and consolidated our software company 12 Hong Kong, Ltd (“12 HK”) under 12 Tech to further streamline operations.
As the retail environment continues to evolve, we as retailers and as primarily a technology company will evolve with it. We believe our developed software and those products in development will delight consumers, provide contactless experiential shopping, and bring revenue back to retailers as they combat the dual threat of Amazon and Walmart. Our software, once fully deployed and implemented, may provide retailers with another electronic and effective sales channel other than Google, Amazon, and/or Facebook/Instagram.
As an innovative holding company that has been built through acquisitions and ideas, we will continue to search for other synergistic acquisitions that bring additional revenues, and/or provide innovative software solutions.
Throughout 2019, the Company made a number of acquisitions for its 12 Retail subsidiary. The criteria management used in selecting and completing these acquisitions was; 1) Each acquisition had significant revenue, 2) management identified that the acquisition could at some point assist in the deployment of our retail software technology, 3) the business could benefit from expense consolidation and better management controls, and 4) be able to be acquired and managed within the resources available to the Company.
In each case, after acquisition, we looked for ways to streamline operations, and shed expensive facilities, reduce labor and material costs, while maintaining and/or growing the revenue and increasing the margins. This process can appear to be messy to an outsider but is a process that management believes will ultimately yield the biggest rewards for our shareholders over time. In most cases each acquisition was followed by a larger acquisition as the Company built momentum. Consequently, the Company had its largest revenue quarter in the 4th quarter of 2019 when it topped $1 million in quarterly revenues for the first time ($1,003,549 vs $ 19,105 in 2018).
In the first quarter of 2020, the processes discussed here continued and accelerated until our business was interrupted by nationwide closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Management used this period once most operations were closed to more swiftly shutter unprofitable retail stores, close the unprofitable Utah factory, and further streamline operations which management believes may make the Company a much stronger player post COVID-19 pandemic. (See Risk Factors).
During the 4th quarter of 2019 the company completed the last two acquisitions for the year (Bluwire Group, LLC & Social Decay d/b/a Social Sunday) and began to consolidate them into 12 Retail. 12 Retail was itself divided into two operating segments; Retail and Fashion. Angelo Ponzetta, our CEO who had 25 years of retail experience, was named as the acting CEO of Bluwire, and Emily Santamore, with over 10 years of experience in the fashion industry, was named President of 12 Fashion Group, Inc.
Principal subsidiaries as December 31, 2020.
The details of the principal subsidiaries of the Company as of December 31, 2020, are set out as follows (additional consolidation may occur in the future):
Retail Corporation: a subsidiary of 12 ReTech Corporation Operates its own retail store (as of March 2021 as a subsequent event) and manages two main subsidiaries each of which have multiple subsidiaries; 12 Fashion Group, Inc and Bluwire Group, LLC.
Fashion Group Inc; A subsidiary of 12 retail, Inc. has the following subsidiaries;
On February 19, 2019 we acquired Red Wire Group, LLC. (“RWG”) a Utah Limited Liability company pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement whereby the Company exchanged and the members of RWG (the “Members”) Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company will acquire (i) 75% of the membership interests of RWG in exchange for 54,000 shares of the Corporation’s Series D-6 Preferred Stock and with a stated value of $5.00 (ii) the remaining 25% of the membership interests of RWG in exchange for 37,500 shares of the Corporation’s Series D-5 Preferred Stock with a stated value of $4.00 per share, RWG operates its own “cut & sew” operation for independent third parties contract to produce cloths operating out of its factory in Salt Lake City, Utah.
As of the end of November 30, 2019, we closed the factory in Utah while 12 Fashion Group retained the customers by completing the orders in process. We were able to produce the products through 3rd party factories in New York City and Los Angeles for less than it cost us to produce the products in our own factory in Salt Lake City, Utah. On March 6, 2020, the company filed a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing in Phoenix Arizona. This filing allowed us to sell the equipment we no longer need, pay off the secured creditors and shed all of Red Wire’s debt from our balance sheet. The bankruptcy was discharged on or about September 2020 and all debts were extinguished. 12 Fashion Group continues to service those customers acquired as well as obtaining new accounts by marketing under the d/b/a Red Wire Designs.
- One March 14, 2019 we acquired Rune NYC, LLC. (“Rune”) a New York Corporation pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement whereby the Company exchanged with the members of Rune (the “Members”), the members of representing 92.5% of the membership interests have agreed to tender their interests to the Corporation, and the Corporation closed out the tender offer period and the Exchange Agreement became effective. Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, at closing the Company acquired 92.5% of the membership interests of Rune in exchange for 82,588 shares of the Corporation’s Series D-5 Preferred Stock with a stated value of $4.00 per share. Rune’s operations continued uninterrupted in New York City following the closing and retained key employees as the leading part of 12 Fashion Group.
- On November 20, 2019 Social Decay, LLC d/b/a Sunday, (“Social”) a New Jersey Limited liability company, was acquired by the Company pursuant to a share exchange agreement whereby the Company exchanged the Company’s 30,000 D-6 Shares for 100% of the total outstanding equity of Social and the member of Social (the “Member”). That Member was retained by the Company, but subsequent to the year end on April 15, 2020 she resigned and as a consequence, forfeited the additional 12,000 D-6 Shares held in escrow as a performance incentive. The D-6 shares have a face value of $5.00 per share, and are convertible into the Company’s common shares. Subsequent to year end in March 2020, Social’s print factory was closed in part due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Social’s products are marketing and manufactured by the staff of 12 Fashion Group.
- Bluwire Group, LLC. On October 1, 2019 the Company acquired the retailer with 11 airport terminal locations and one casino location under an equity exchange agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement the Company issued to the Sellers 500,000 Series A Preferred Shares in exchange for 51% of the equity in Bluwire Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Bluwire”). The Sellers retained 30% of Bluwire and 19% is reserved for 12 months for potential equity investors into Bluwire. Any of that equity not used to raise capital for Bluwire over that period would be divided equally between the Company and the Sellers. No capital was raised for Bluwire Group and this 19% was issued to 12 ReTech Corporation
- Tech, Inc. An Arizona corporation is a subsidiary of 12 ReTech Corporation and has a number of subsidiaries (“12Tech”). On December 26, 2019, the Company formed 12 Tech to spearhead the Company’s software technology development and to focus more effort on the largest retail market in the world: the United States of America. The Company then closed or consolidated under 12 Tech all its other software technology companies and maintains the following subsidiaries;
- Hong Kong, Ltd., a corporation organized in the special economic region of Hong Kong is a subsidiary of 12 Tech, Inc. On June 27, 2017 the Company acquired 12 Hong Kong, Ltd. in a share exchange transaction. Originally this is the Company that managed all the Company’s proprietary and licensed technology that is utilized and sold by the other subsidiaries. With the formation of 12 Tech that role is now being managed by 12 Tech. Today, 12 HK operates as a subsidiary of 12 Tech and serves as the marketing and sales hub for Asia, particularly the Chinese market and now services our customers in Japan, formerly managed by 12 Japan Ltd.
- Japan, LTD. Organized in Japan and is a subsidiary of 12 Tech inc. After the initial acquisition of 12 Hong Kong, LTD during 2017 and the first half of 2018 the Company made several acquisitions including 12 Japan, LTD. Subsequent to this acquisition, the Company took steps to consolidate the assets and streamline operations that effectively by the end the 3rd quarter 2019, this Company no longer functions as independent subsidiary. In the third quarter of 2019 the Company closed the offices of 12 Japan, and its flagship customer ITOYA and the revenue generated will be serviced and managed by 12 Hong Kong.
- Europe, A.G. 12 Europe A.G. was acquired in 2017, and underperformed. In the third quarter 2019 it was determined by management that the costs of continuing to support the expenses of an independent 12 Europe A.G., were unsupportable. Therefore, the Company reaffirmed its previous master representation agreement between 12 Hong Kong, LTD and Coppola, AG so that the software customers in Europe can continue to be supported and then closed its operations in Europe. On August 20, 2019, the Company had successfully discharged all of its debts associated with 12 Europe A.G., as part of the completion of the 12 Europe A.G., bankruptcy filing except for certain social benefit payments still owed approximately $35K by the Company. Therefore, this subsidiary is no longer in existence.
Business and Operations
ReTech Corporation is a Technology company that is creating software that management believes will create new platforms and tools for smaller retailers to compete with major companies like Amazon and Walmart and delight consumers. To better understand the entire retail environment the Company has acquired operating companies that sell direct to consumers online and in physical stores as well as to other retailers. These acquisitions, in addition to providing current revenue to the Company management believes that they will provide entree to other retailers for the sale and or licensing of our technology solutions.
From an operating perspective, 12 ReTech Corporation is a holding company with two main operating companies that themselves may now and/or in the future own other subsidiaries. They are: 12 Retail Corporation which now operates our casino stores and subsidiaries Bluwire Group, LLC, 12 Fashion Group, Inc and others, and 12 Tech Inc that designs and develops our retail software.
The Company has earned money from four different revenue streams (in declining order): Retail Sales, Wholesale and Online sales of Fashion products, Royalty Payments for 3rd party licensing of the Bluwire name, and technology sales.
Effects on us of the Covid-19 Pandemic
was an unusual year, in that at nearly the same time the entire world was in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic with unprecedented closings of businesses, a virtual cessation of most business and personal travel, lockdown and stay at home orders. As a Company centered on retail and which derives the most significant portion of its revenue from retail stores in airports and casinos, we were hit particularly hard. In retail, the 1st quarter of every year is the slowest revenue quarter of any year, and even before that first quarter ended all of our retail stores were closed due to the pandemic. Only the casino store was able to be re-opened in mid-December 2020 to lackluster sales. Supply chains were interrupted, and it became difficult to re-stock our retail store for the holiday season which also delayed its re-opening to mid-December, after an aborted restart in September. The supply chain problems also delayed the receipt of fabric and other products needed by our Fashion Group as they began to re-emerge from under the pandemic closures. Our fashion group, being based-in NYC was closed for many months and only reopened in July to produce masks. All of the stores our fashion group would sell to were also closed. Our technology division, 12 Tech Inc, was also hard hit. Not only were retailers closed and conserving cash like we were, but it became apparent that consumers would no longer interact with public touchscreens, which was the corner stone of our technology. In other words, our technology was made obsolete in the blink of an eye.
The Company managed survival during the pandemic by squirreling cash and obtaining PPP and or EIDL loans from the SBA. We attempted to retain all of our key employees utilizing these funds, but as a subsequent event by June 2021 most have found other jobs once the PPP money ran out. This presents challenges for our airport stores re-openings, as it is a long process to get employees certified (“badged”) to work in airports. This will further slow our re-openings during 2021. We also renegotiated various leases and commitments to make us more streamlined and efficient as we re-open and expand. In Japan, we renegotiated out licensing arrangement with ITOYA whereby they managed more of the day to day software for a smaller fee and we eliminated virtually all of our costs there. We also learned that the App we had developed there was strongly used by Japanese consumers of ITOYA and we could re-develop it for the U.S. market. This process is well on the way and management believes will create the next great shopping platform.

Financing and Convertible Debt
To finance our operations the Company has historically resorted to a number of convertible debt providers (see Note 10). These debt providers have in many cases exercised their rights to convert their debt into the Company’s common stock at a discount to market. They then sell that stock to recover their investment and profits. This has over time depressed the value of our Company’s common stock and caused a significant dilution to our shareholders. This could not be avoided, and management believes it was necessary in order to provide continuation of the Company’s business so that we could make significant acquisitions. The Company has been building revenue momentum through these acquisitions and is no longer exclusively reliant on this form of fund raising. The vast majority of the funds the Company has received over the last 4 months have been sourced through non-convertible debt incurred by our operating subsidiaries. There is, however, still a considerable amount of convertible debt that needs to be retired over the near term. Management is working closely with the convertible note holders to find less dilutive alternatives and management believes that in first half of 2021 it will arrive at a solution that will involve less dilution, may require some cash payments from other sources including an equity offering and/or debt offerings through one or more of its subsidiaries as well as leak out provisions negotiated with the convertible debt holders themselves.
The Company had also entered into a $12 million dollar Equity Line of Credit with Oasis Capital which it has been unable to access due to some delays in the audits of one of its acquired subsidiaries. That has been resolved and Management has been in talks with Oasis on amending that original offering, so that the Company may refile the S-1 required with the SEC. The equity line of credit is ineffective at the current share price, and we will not be able to reinstitute at current share price levels.
In addition, Management has received tentative commitments for preferred Equity Funding that if completed would allow the Company to fully retire the convertible debt. Management, however, cautions readers that while promising no Equity or Debt funding can truly be counted upon until the money is in the bank. The exact amount of the final funding and timing have not been fully determined at this time.
However, management believes that now that the Company has significant and growing revenue, has streamlined operations, is set to launch its software products in its own stores in the United States, and has access to more standard debt capital, that the issues associated with the convertible debt have become more manageable and therefore will be resolved more favorably to the Company than was previously observed.
YEAR ENDED December 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED December 31, 2019
Amounts reflected in our financial statements are accounted for under common control accounting (see footnotes).
Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2020 our revenues decreased to $721,312 from $1,628,607 in the prior comparable year. This represents and decrease of $907,295 or 56%, which is primarily the result of the global pandemic due to COVID 19 on our Bluwire subsidiary and 12 Fashion Group subsidiary. The government forced the closure of all our store locations on March 16, 2020. When allowed, the company was able to re-open one of our store locations in December 2020. We hope to open additional store locations in the near future.
Cost of revenues
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we incurred Cost of Revenues associated with the delivery of our products in the amount of $385,236, as compared to $1,122,086 for the comparable period in 2019. These expenses are related to costs of delivering goods. In 2020, our Cost of Revenues as a percentage of Revenues was 53% as compared to 66% in the prior comparable period. The lower cost of revenues as a percentage of Revenues in 2020 is mainly the result of on cutting purchases of inventory and production materials due to COVID 19.
General and Administrative
Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,762,856, a significant decrease of $361,516 or 17% when compared to $2,124,372 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is a result of impact due to COVID 19 and forced closure of operations during many months.
Professional fees
Our professional fee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $683,251 a decrease of $542,448 or 44% when, compared to $1,225,699 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our professional fees include expenses related to our external auditors, legal costs, and consultants. In order to preserve our subsidiaries operations, the company conserved on spending from the period of closure on March 16, 2020 until December 31, 2020.
Depreciation and amortization
Our depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $439,269 an increase of $340,163 or 343% when, compared to $99,107 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our depreciation and amortization expense includes intangibles and leasehold improvements added October 1, 2019 as part of the Bluwire acquisition. As such the company had twelve months of depreciation and amortization as opposed to three months in 2019.
Other Expense
Our Other Expenses increased by $10,187,508 or 110% to $19,391,799 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $9,204,291 for the year ended December 31, 2019. There are four main components of the increase of the 2020 Other Expense category:
1. A significant increase in loss of change in derivative liability of $18,860,260 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3,524,861 for twelve months ended December 31, 2019 resulting in an increase of $22,385,121 which is the result of the calculation of derivative liability using Black-Scholes.
2. A decrease in other income to $431,937 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,023,965 for twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Other income was primarily the result from the write off of certain debts which was described in 2019 10K.
3. A decrease in general default reserve expense of for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $491,897 as of December 31, 2020 compared to $2,139,961 as of December 31, 2019.
4. A decrease in interest expense of $8,523,487 to $471,579 as of December 31, 2020 compared to $8,995,066 for the ended December 31, 2019.
See these components described in further detail below.
Other Income
During 2019, the Company recognized a loss impairment of software development costs of $513,601 December 31, 2019 without a similar comparable expense during the prior period ending December 31, 2019. Periodically, management reviews its capitalized costs to determine if they are properly valued or should they be impaired. As of September 30, 2019. Management had capitalized approximately $513,601 in development costs for its 12 Technology Suite and 12 Sconti APP. While management still believes in the long-term validity of these software applications, the fact remains that adoption by retailers has not met management’s expectations. This led management to cut costs in the 12 Europe and 12 Japan operations. Therefore, management believes that the capitalized costs for the software development should be fully impaired during the 4th quarter of 2019.
Also, during 2019, the Company recognized other income primarily from 12 Europe declaring bankruptcy on August 26, 2019, whereby all debts of the company were eliminated with the exception of $35,757 in accounts payable resulting in a gain of $445,244. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, the Company effectively foreclosed on its liens against the assets of Emotion Apparel, Inc. taking possession of assets including the brands; Lexi-Luu, Emotion Fashion Group, Punkz Gear and retuned the equity of Emotion Apparel, Inc. and its subsidiaries to the Seller. As a result of the debts related to Emotion Apparel, Inc, which reverted to the Seller including all accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable resulting in a gain of $511,486 to the Company. Lastly, after careful review by management, certain accounts payable were determined not to be valid expenses. These payables totaling approximately $68,000 were offset as a gain to other income.
In 2020, the company filed for bankruptcy for the Red Wire Group. As a result, the company recognized other income as a result of write off of debt associated with Red Wire Group. In addition, the company also closed its Denver Bluwire store location, as such the company wrote off associated intercompany loans.
Interest Expense
There was also a decrease in interest expense of $8,523,487 to $471,579 as of December 31, 2020 compared to $8,995,066 for the period ended December 31, 2019. Decrease in interest expenses is related to decrease in convertible notes’ convertible preferred stock during the same period. As well as a significant decrease in interest expense associated with the additional derivative liability and for the general default reserve.
Change in Derivative Liability
There was a loss as a result of the change of derivative liability of $18,860,260 as of December 31, 2020 compared to gain of $3,524,861 for the period ended December 31, 2019. The reason for the change was because of a change in the calculation method from Lattice model to Black-Scholes model.
General Reserve Expense
The company recognized a general default reserve expense of for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $491,897 compared to 2,139,961 as of December 31, 2019. On July 25, 2019 the Company was served with a lawsuit from Auctus Fund, LLC (“Auctus”). For additional details, see MD&A including the settlement of $120,375 which is still pending. However, management calculated a default reserve which represents the additional amount management would have to payout to all note holders in the event of the default. Management quantified what this amount would be which includes additional premiums, additional accrued interest and default accrued interest in 2019 and updated these calculations in 2020. The total reserve quantified by management amounted to $2,278,648 as of December 31, 2020.
Net Income
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss of $21,940,137 compared to a net loss of $12,150,698 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increased loss is primarily the result of the increase in the change in derivative liability and compounded by the significant decrease in revenues as a result of the global pandemic of COVID 19 during 2020.
The Company is expending working capital to further their business plan. This includes the further development, refinement and improvement of their software and its adaptation to various languages and geography. The Company is also expending working capital on the development of new technology which is designed to further enhance the attractiveness of their offerings to their target customer base.
Significant Acquisitions in 2019
In the first quarter of 2019 the Company made two significant acquisitions as detailed above with the acquisition of Red Wire Group on February 19, 2019 and Rune NYC, LLC on March 14, 2019. the Company gained two revenue-producing operations. As also detailed above on October 1, 2019 the Company acquired Bluwire Group, LLC and effective November 1, 2019, the Company acquired Social Decay, LLC dba Social Sunday. With the combination of these acquisitions, management believes that the Company will benefit, and it will significantly expand the sales channels for all of its brands. As of December 31, 2019, the Company performed its annual impairment test on all reporting units and determined that each unit had indicating factors of impairment due to failure to meet respective sales projections. For further details, see Note 3.
Management believes that these acquisitions are “game changers” for the Company for two more reasons; 1) the wholesale customers acquired sell to are and will become targets for the Company to sell its disruptive retail technology solution to other retailers and 2) is already attracting interest among other companies that would like to join the 12 ReTech team either through acquisition or through strategic partnership.
While management believes the results of operations for 2019 for the acquired companies are not indicative of the future results for all of the reasons herein above combined with impact of COVID-19, management believes it is important to show how materially the prior year’s revenues would have been for the Company had they been acquired at the beginning of 2019 without the material improvements we have made since acquiring them.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has met its current capital requirements primarily through the issuance of debt-equity and preferred stock. Management views the working capital that is raised through debt-equity or preferred equity offerings as being equivalent to raising working capital via common equity subscriptions, but with the added bonus of allowing the common equity value to rise through the passage of time and simultaneous achievement of the Company’s business goals. Any conversion of debt into equity could occur at a higher equity valuation then the Company currently has. The Company has reserved the right to repurchase these debt-equity interests and preferred stock at a predetermined premium should management determine that this is in the best interests of shareholders at an appropriate future point in time.
Operating expenses for the Company have been paid from revenue as well as from the issuance of debt-equity and preferred stock subscriptions. At December 31, 2020 the Company had a deficit in working capital (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $31,490,395. A portion of this working capital deficit has been financed loans from stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, amounts owed to stockholders totaled $383,753. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a deficit in working capital (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $11,786,147. A portion of this working capital deficit has been financed loans from stockholders. As of December 31, 2019, amounts owed to stockholders totaled $384,091. The increase in working capital deficit when compared to December 31, 2019 was principally due to an increase derivative liabilities and to a lesser extent, increase in accounts payable.
The Company has financed our cash flow requirements through the issuance of debt-equity and preferred stock. As the Company expands, we may continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations, pending generation of significant revenues. Additionally, we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through debt-equity and preferred stock offerings to the extent available or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital balances.
Management believes that our acquisition strategy will successfully provide significant revenues, potential profits as well as access to traditional bank and asset-based credit lines. In addition, Management believes that existing shareholders, lenders and prospective new investors will provide the additional cash needed to meet our obligations as they become due.
The Company filed a Certificate of Designation on January 9, 2019 to create 1,000,000 Series D-5 Convertible Preferred Stock with par value $0.00001 and stated value of $4.00 per share. Also on January 9, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation to create One Million (1,000,000) Series D-6 Convertible Preferred Stock with par value $0.00001 and stated value of $5.00 per share.
The Company filed an amendment on January 11, 2019 to Series C Preferred shares where each issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to 8,000,000,000 votes at each meeting of shareholders of the Company with respect to any and all matters presented to the shareholders of the Company for their action or consideration (by vote or written consent). Holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Shares as a single class.
The Company also filed with the State of Nevada an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation on March 8, 2018, that increased it authorized common shares from One billion to eight billion common shares authorized. On March 14, 2019, the Company entered into a PIPE Equity Purchase Agreement whereby an institutional investor agreed to purchase up to $500,000 worth of the Company’s D-2 Preferred Shares with a $2.00 face value at to be determined discount to face value. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the Company sold 103,500 preferred D-2 Preferred Shares and received net proceeds after expenses of $100,000 (Tranche #1). The D-2 Preferred Shares are convertible to common shares after a 6 month or more holding period at market price. (See Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2019).

In the future we will need to generate sufficient revenues from operations in order to eliminate or reduce the need to sell additional stock or obtain additional loans. However, there can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary funds to execute our high growth business plan.
At December 31, 2020, the Cash and Cash Equivalents balance was $11,784 compared to December 31, 2019, the Cash and Cash Equivalents balance was $118,860.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the current liabilities increased by $19,409,181 when compared to December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the increase was the increase in derivative liabilities of $18,438,798 to $23,798,240 and accounts payable of $1,020,96 to $3,187,592 as of December 31, 2020 compared to $5,359,422 and $2,167,496 as of December 31, 2019. Due to Covid 19 pandemic, the company tried to preserve operations and obtained extended terms from most of its creditors.
As discussed earlier, it is likely that the Company will need to obtain additional working capital through debt-equity and preferred stock capital raises until the Company can generate sufficiently profitable revenues to sustain the cash burn rate that the Company’s business plan calls for.
Although, our business plan calls for high growth, we anticipate that we may continue to incur operating losses during the next twelve months. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies at our stage, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Our roll up acquisition strategy seeks to mitigate some of those risks, but until more acquisitions can be completed, consolidated, and we reap the benefits of consolidation, we cannot accurately include their results in our projection of cash needs.
Risks include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth and the consummation and assimilation of multiple acquisitions. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To address these risks, we must, among other things, increase our customer base, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.
Impact of COVID-19
Like most other business in the United States, our businesses have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic. While the first quarter of any calendar year is historically the slowest quarter of the year for revenues, for our main operating subsidiaries the first quarter of 2020 was severely impacted by US Government’s business shutdowns and stay at home orders related to COVID-19. We derive most of our revenue from our 12 Retail Corporation, which is itself composed of two Operating units: 12 Fashion Group and Bluwire Group, LLC.
In response to the President’s “stay at home” orders, on March 16, 2020, we promptly laid off almost all of our 12 Fashion Group employees and contractors. 12 Fashion Group retained three employee/contractors and focused on producing and selling of washable reusable masks, both wholesale and direct to consumer online.
Our Bluwire retail stores in Newark airport, Dallas airport, and JFK international airport were temporarily closed on or about March 17, 2020. Our Casino location was temporarily closed on or about March 17, 2020 when the Mohegan Sun Casino itself was closed. We laid off all of our Bluwire employee/contractors except two members of the headquarters staff who continued to source innovative products for our stores when they re-open, some of which will be uniquely desired by consumers due to changing buying habits due to COVID-19.
The financial effects of these closures are reflected in the Management Discussion and Analysis.
The Cares Act and the Payroll Protection Program SBA Loans (PPP Loans).
The Company has applied for PPP Loans for all of its U.S. operating Companies, and is in the process of analyzing if it would qualify for similar governmental assistance for its reduced operating unit in Japan (12 Japan Ltd). The Company has qualified and received for an aggregate of $294,882 of PPP Loans for its operating companies. These funds are being used to re-hire previously laid off personnel where appropriate and hire new personal that management believes better fits the post COVID-19 shut down environment. The Company is hiring personnel that will help the operating units generate revenues in a more contactless environment and to create changes to our cutting-edge retail software to help our stores and well as other retailers attract consumers in this new environment. The Cares Act provides very favorable terms for the repayment or forgiveness of the monies lent to qualifying businesses like ours. While the final rules are not yet formalized, the initial guidelines allow for complete forgiveness for monies spent on approved expenses such as payroll and labor with non- approved expenses to be paid back over 2 years at 1% annual interest with no payments for the first 6 months after receipt. No collateral was pledged for these loans and management did not have to sign any personal guarantees. Management will make every effort to utilize these PPP loan funds in a manner that may allow for complete forgiveness of the loan(s) while providing the best opportunity for the continuity and growth of the business.
During the COVID-19 shutdown period management sourced new products and vendors for its businesses and is now optimistic that it will shortly obtain additional funding of debt or preferred equity to grow our business.
Reliance on the SEC’s March 25, 2019 order regarding extension of filing deadlines due to COVID-19
As a direct result of the COVID-19 shutdowns and travel restrictions, the SEC provided for any public company impacted by COVID-19 to extend its filing of its 10-K or 10-Q or other required filings for 45 additional days and would still be eligible for the further normal extensions of 15 and 5 days respectively. As noted herein, we have been extremely impacted on an operational level, delayed in obtaining information from our foreign subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Japan, as well as being delayed in our ability to obtain capital for the professional fees to complete our filings, and further compromised by the fact that our CEO and CFO are both restricted from travel to the United States at this time as they are in Hong Kong and Japan respectively. Therefore, we filed for a 45 day and 15-day NT10-KA Filing extensions in reliance on the March 25, 2020, order and have further been in communication with the SEC for additional consideration for timely filing under these extraordinary circumstances.
However, due to cash restraints with all of our closed operations, the Company was unable to meet any deadline to complete this audit and the quarterly reports (forms 10-Q) in a timely fashion during 2020 and the first quarter 2021. The Company retained auditor BF Borgers on April 28, 2021 and will complete all delinquent filings in the second quarter 2021. With our businesses reopening and revenues being generated, Management believes that it can continue to make timely filings in the future.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. Since we have not yet generated significant revenue, we have negative cash flows from operations, and negative working capital we have included a reference to the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our total accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 was $44,475,900 compared to $22,756,345 as of December 31, 2019.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized, and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may cease operations and not be able to execute on operating plans. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Elected Mandatory Filer Status
The Company filed Form 8A-12G with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2018 and therefore became a mandatory filer with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We use assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. We believe there have been no significant changes in accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 3 to the consolidated statements in this Annual Report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its consolidated results of operation, financial position, or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 to the consolidated statements in this Annual Report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates.
