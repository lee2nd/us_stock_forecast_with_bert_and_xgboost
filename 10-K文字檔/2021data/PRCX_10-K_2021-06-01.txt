ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
COVID-19 Impacts and Effects
COVID-19, a viral pandemic, has affected the international community, public health, and financial markets throughout the world. Similarly, this public health crisis has impacted the Company, its operations, and the results of those business activities. Due to the location of the Company’s segmented business activities in China, the virus has had a significant impact as it reportedly began spreading from Southeast Asia.
During these unprecedented times, our priority has been, and continues to be, the health, safety and sustainability of our employees, customers, communities, and our marketplace. We have responded quickly to the crisis to drive as much business as possible to e-commerce and telecommunication portals. We will continue to support the local communities and our customers that are struggling with this uncertain and difficult time period.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior during February and March when the pandemic took hold throughout China. Initially, we observed a decrease in business activity in both of our operational segments as news of the pandemic upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like.
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.
If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.
