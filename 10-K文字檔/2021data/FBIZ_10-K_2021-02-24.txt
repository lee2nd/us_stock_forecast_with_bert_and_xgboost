The following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant events and factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto.
Overview
We are a registered bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin and are engaged in the commercial banking business through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, FBB. All of our operations are conducted through FBB and First Business Specialty Finance, LLC (“FBSF”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBB. We operate as a business bank focusing on delivering a full line of commercial banking products and services tailored to meet the specific needs of small and medium-sized businesses, business owners, executives, professionals, and high net worth individuals. Our products and services include those for business banking, private wealth, and bank consulting. Within business banking, we offer commercial lending, consumer and other lending, asset-based lending, accounts receivable financing, equipment financing, floorplan financing, vendor financing, SBA lending and servicing, treasury management services, and company retirement plans. Our private wealth services for executives and individuals include trust and estate administration, financial planning, investment management, and private banking. For other financial institutions, our bank consulting experts provide investment portfolio administrative services, asset liability management services, and asset liability management process validation. We do not utilize a branch network to attract retail clients. Our operating philosophy is predicated on deep client relationships within our commercial bank markets and skilled expertise within our nationwide specialty finance business lines, combined with the efficiency of centralized administrative functions, such as information technology, loan and deposit operations, finance and accounting, credit administration, compliance, marketing, and human resources. Our focused model allows experienced staff to provide the level of financial expertise needed to develop and maintain long-term relationships with our clients.
Long-Term Strategic Plan
In early 2019, the Corporation finalized the development of its five year strategic plan and began the implementation of strategies and initiatives that will drive successful execution. The Corporation’s objective over this five year period is to excel by building the best team that works together to impact client success more than any other financial partner. To meet this objective, we identified four key strategies which are linked to corporate financial goals, all business lines, and centralized administration functions to ensure communication and execution are consistent at all levels of the Corporation. These four strategies are described below:
•We will identify, attract, develop, and retain a diverse, high performing team to positively impact the overall performance and efficiency of the Corporation.
•We will increase internal efficiencies, deliver a differentiated client experience, and drive client experience utilizing technology where possible.
•We will diversify and grow our deposit base.
•We will optimize our business lines for diversification and performance.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, a pandemic as a result of the global spread of the coronavirus illness. In response to the outbreak, federal and state authorities in the U.S. introduced various measures to try to limit or slow the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, nonessential business closures, stay-at-home orders, and strict social distancing. The Corporation activated its Pandemic Preparedness Plan to protect the health of employees and clients, which includes temporarily limiting lobby hours and transitioning the vast majority of the Corporation’s workforce to remote work. The Corporation has not incurred any significant disruptions to its business activities.
The full impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain. It has caused substantial disruption in international and U.S. economies, markets, and employment. The outbreak is having a significant adverse impact on certain industries the Corporation serves, including retail, restaurants and food services, hospitality, and entertainment. Because of the significant uncertainties related to the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on clients and prospects, and on the national and local economy as a whole, there can be no assurances as to how the crisis may ultimately affect the Corporation’s financial performance.
Despite these tremendous headwinds, in 2020 we remained focused on building and developing our diverse team, creating efficiencies, growing deposits, and optimizing business line performance. These efforts resulted in strong operating performance, highlighted by record top line revenue growth and record loan and deposit growth, excluding Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. Our key profitability metrics of return on average equity and return on average assets were negatively impacted by elevated provision for loan and lease losses primarily due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we remain steadfast in the pursuit of our long-term goals and firmly believe our 2020 performance positions the Corporation well for strong and sustainable earnings growth in 2021 and beyond.
The following table below shows the Corporation’s performance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 in comparison to the key performance indicators included in the Corporation’s long-term strategic plan.

•In January 2021, the Corporation received a recovery of approximately $2.0 million on a loan charged off in a prior year. While this recovery will have a positive impact on the Company’s provision for loan and lease losses in the first quarter of 2021, it is not necessarily indicative of a trend or a reflection of the Company’s ultimate provision for the first quarter.
•Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $26.9 million, or 25.9% of total revenue, compared to $23.4 million, or 25.1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

•Period-end gross loans and leases receivable, excluding net PPP loans, at December 31, 2020 increased $206.0 million, or 12.01%, to $1.921 billion from $1.715 billion as of December 31, 2019. Average gross loans and leases, excluding net PPP loans, of $1.796 billion increased $92.3 million, or 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.704 billion for the same period in 2019.
•PPP loans and PPP deferred processing fees were $228.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Average PPP loans, net of deferred processing fees, were $215.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Non-performing assets were $26.7 million and 1.04% of total assets as of December 31, 2020, compared to $23.5 million and 1.12% of total assets as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets to total assets, excluding net PPP loans was 1.14% as of December 31, 2020.

The allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.33% of total loans as of December 31, 2020, compared to 1.14% as of December 31, 2019. Excluding net PPP loans, the allowance for loan and lease losses increased to 1.48% of total loans as of December 31, 2020.
•Period-end in-market deposits at December 31, 2020 increased $304.1 million, or 22.1%, to $1.683 billion from $1.379 billion as of December 31, 2019. Average in-market deposits of $1.569 billion increased $297.4 million, or 23.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.271 billion for the same period in 2019.
•Trust assets under management and administration increased by $356.8 million, or 18.9%, to $2.249 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.892 billion at December 31, 2019.
•On January 28, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a new share repurchase program that authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $5 million of the Company’s common stock over a period of approximately twelve months, ending on January 31, 2022. The Company suspended its prior share repurchase program in March 2020 due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the previous plan, which was initiated in September 2019 and expired September 30, 2020, the Company had repurchased $3.5 million of the $5 million authorized in the Company’s common stock.
COVID-19 Update
As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $228.9 million in PPP loans outstanding and $3.5 million in deferred processing fees outstanding. The processing fees are deferred and recognized over the contractual life of the loan, or accelerated when forgiven and repaid, as an adjustment of yield using the interest method. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation recognized $5.3 million in PPP fees, recording 60% of the $8.8 million in deferred Small Business Administration (“SBA”) processing fees for loans originated in 2020. The SBA provides a guaranty to the lender of 100% of principal and interest, unless the lender violated an obligation under the agreement. As loan losses are expected to be immaterial, if any at all, due to the guaranty, management excluded the gross PPP loans from the allowance for loan and lease losses calculation.
In January 2021, the Corporation began accepting applications for the SBA’s most recent phase of the PPP program, with an emphasis on supporting in-market businesses and non-profit organizations. As of February 1, 2021, the Corporation had processed and approved over 300 applications for the most recent phase of the PPP program for approximately $85.0 million.
Liquidity Sources
Management has reviewed all primary and secondary sources of liquidity in preparation for any unforeseen funding needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and prioritized based on available capacity, term flexibility, and cost. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had the following sources of liquidity, including the Corporation’s ability to participate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”):
In addition to the above primary sources of liquidity, as of December 31, 2020, the Corporation also had access to $53.5 million in federal funds lines with various correspondent banks and significant experience accessing the highly liquid brokered deposit market.
Capital Strength
The Corporation’s capital ratios continued to exceed the highest required regulatory benchmark levels.
•Total capital to risk-weighted assets at December 31, 2020 was 11.25%, tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 8.96%, tier 1 leverage capital to adjusted average assets was 7.99%, and common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 8.53%. Tangible common equity to tangible assets was 7.60%. Excluding net PPP loans, tier 1 leverage capital to adjusted average assets and tangible common equity to tangible assets were 8.97% and 8.33%, respectively.
•As previously announced, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Corporation’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share. The dividend was paid on November 12, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 2, 2020. Measured against fourth quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share of $0.71, the dividend represents a 23.2% payout ratio. The Board of Directors routinely considers dividend declarations as part of its normal course of business.
•On January 29, 2021, the Corporation’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.18 per share. The quarterly dividend represents a 9% increase over the quarterly dividend declared in October 2020, and, based on fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share, a dividend payout ratio of 25.4%.
Deferral Requests
The Corporation provided loan modifications deferring payments up to six months to certain borrowers impacted by COVID-19 who were current in their payments at the inception of the Corporation’s loan modification program. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had deferred loans outstanding of $27.0 million, or 1.4% of gross loans and leases, excluding gross PPP loans, compared to $131.5 million, or 7.1% as of September 30, 2020 and $323.2 million, or 18.6% as of June 30, 2020. The following tables represent a breakdown of the deferred loan balances by industry segment and collateral type:
The following table is a further breakdown of the deferred loan balances by certain credit quality indicators. Please refer to Note 5 - Loan and Lease Receivables, Impaired Loans and Leases and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for the risk category definitions.
Exposure to Stressed Industries
Certain industries have been and are expected to be particularly impacted by social distancing, quarantines, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the following:
(1)Excluding net PPP loans.
(2)Includes $48.9 million, $52.0 million, and $51.7 million in loans secured by commercial real estate as of December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, and June 30, 2020, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had no meaningful direct exposure to the energy sector, airline industry, or retail consumer, and does not participate in shared national credits.
Because of the significant uncertainties related to the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our clients and prospects, and on the national and local economy as a whole, there can be no assurances as to how the pandemic may ultimately affect the Corporation’s loan portfolio.
Results of Operations
Top Line Revenue
Top line revenue, comprised of net interest income and non-interest income, increased 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a $7.2 million, or 10.3%, increase in net interest income and a $3.5 million, or 15.0%, increase in non-interest income. The increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in average loans and leases outstanding, and loan fees collected in lieu of interest, while the increase in non-interest income was primarily a result of a $2.7 million increase in swap fees and a $1.4 million increase in gains on the sale of SBA loans. These favorable variances in top line revenue were partially offset by a reduction in net interest margin which decreased 21 basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 3.61% in the prior year.
The components of top line revenue were as follows:
Return on Average Assets and Return on Average Equity
Return on average assets (“ROAA”) was 0.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.14% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in ROAA can be attributed principally to a $14.7 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses during the same time period. The increase in the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by $7.8 million of net charge-offs, a $6.4 million increase in general reserve related to the uncertainty of the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and a $2.3 million increase in the general reserve due to loan growth. Please refer to the Components of the Provision for Loan and Lease Losses included in the Provision for Loan and Lease Losses discussion below. The COVID-19 related credit headwind in 2020 was partially offset by record top line revenue. We consider ROAA a critical metric to measure the profitability of our organization and how efficiently our assets are deployed. ROAA also allows us to better benchmark our profitability to our peers without the need to consider different degrees of leverage which can ultimately influence return on equity measures.
Return on average equity (“ROAE”) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 8.64% compared to 12.55% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reasons for the increase in ROAE are consistent with the net income variance explanations as discussed under Return on Average Assets above. We view ROAE as an important measurement for monitoring profitability and continue to focus on improving our return to our shareholders by enhancing the overall profitability of our client relationships, controlling our expenses, and minimizing our costs of credit.
Efficiency Ratio and Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Adjusted Earnings
Efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure representing non-interest expense excluding the effects of the SBA recourse benefit or provision, impairment of tax credit investments, net gains or losses on foreclosed properties, amortization of other intangible assets, losses on early extinguishment of debt, and other discrete items, if any, divided by operating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus non-interest income less realized net gains or losses on securities, if any. Pre-tax, pre-provision adjusted earnings is defined as operating revenue less operating expense. In the judgment of the Corporation’s management, the adjustments made to non-interest expense and non-interest income allow investors and analysts to better assess the Corporation’s operating expenses in relation to its core operating revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain one-time items and other discrete items.
The efficiency ratio improved to 63.09% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 66.59% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This improvement was the result of exceptional 2020 operating revenue attributable to above average fee income generated by the Corporation’s commercial loan interest rate swap program and SBA loan sales, as well as an increase in net interest income driven by an 18.0% increase in average loans and leases receivable and $2.8 million, or 43.8%, increase in fees in lieu of interest. The increase in fees in lieu of interest included $5.3 million in PPP fees. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by a $3.8 million, or 9.1%, increase in compensation expense reflecting in part the Corporation’s continued investment in its growth strategy. Full-time equivalent employees (“FTE”) were 301 as of December 31, 2020, increasing by 13, or 4.5%, from 288 as of December 31, 2019. The period-end increase in FTEs as of
December 31, 2020 consisted of six net new production positions and seven net new support positions across multiple business lines. We believe we will continue to generate modest positive operating leverage and progress towards enhancing our long-term efficiency ratio at a measured pace as we focus on strategic initiatives directed toward revenue growth. These initiatives include efforts to expand our specialty finance lines of business, increase our commercial banking market share, and scale our private wealth management business in our less mature commercial banking markets.
We believe the efficiency ratio and pre-tax, pre-provision adjusted earnings allow investors and analysts to better assess the Corporation’s operating expenses in relation to its top line revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain non-recurring and other discrete items. The efficiency ratio and pre-tax, pre-provision adjusted earnings also allow management to benchmark performance of our model to our peers without the influence of the loan loss provision and tax considerations, which will ultimately influence other traditional financial measurements, including ROAA and ROAE. The information provided below reconciles the efficiency ratio to its most comparable GAAP measure.
Please refer to the Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense sections below for discussion on additional drivers of the year-over-year change in the efficiency ratio.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income levels depend on the amount of and yield on interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of and rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and the asset/liability management processes to prepare for and respond to such changes.
The table below shows average balances, interest, average rates, net interest margin and the spread between combined average rates earned on our interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. The average balances are derived from average daily balances.
(1)The average balances of loans and leases include non-accrual loans and leases and loans held for sale. Interest income related to non-accrual loans and leases is recognized when collected. Interest income includes net loan fees collected in lieu of interest.
(2)Includes amortized cost basis of assets available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.
(3)Yields on tax-exempt municipal securities are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis in this table.
The following table provides information with respect to: (1) the change in net interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (2) the change in net interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net interest income attributable to changes in rate and volume (changes in rate multiplied by changes in volume) has been allocated to the rate and volume changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
Rate/Volume Analysis
(1)The average balances of loans and leases include non-accrual loans and leases and loans held for sale. Interest income related to non-accrual loans and leases is recognized when collected. Interest income includes net loan fees collected in lieu of interest.
(2)Includes amortized cost basis of assets available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.
Net interest income increased by $7.2 million, or 10.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase compared to the prior year was principally due to an increase in average loans and leases outstanding and loan fees collected in lieu of interest. Average gross loans and leases of $2.011 billion increased by $307.4 million, or 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.704 billion for the same period in 2019, while loan fees collected in lieu of interest increased 43.8% to $9.3 million, compared to $6.5 million during the same period of comparison. These favorable variances were partially offset by net interest margin compression as the decline in rate across all interest-earning assets, in particular total loans and leases receivable, was greater than the decline in rate across all interest-bearing liabilities. Excluding fees in lieu of interest and interest income from PPP loans, net interest income increased $2.2 million, or 3.5%. Excluding net PPP loans, average gross loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $92.3 million, or 5.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The yield on average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.16%, a decrease of 111 basis points compared to 5.27% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was principally due to the decrease in LIBOR and Prime rates and related impact on variable-rate loans, in addition to the renewal of fixed-rate loans and reinvestment of security
cash flows at historically low interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by the increase in recurring loan fees collected in lieu of interest. Excluding the impact of loan fees in lieu of interest in both 2020 and 2019, the yield on average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.75%, a decrease of 119 basis points compared to 4.94% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The yield on average loans and leases receivable for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.43%, a decrease of 122 basis points compared to 5.65% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reasons for this decrease are consistent with the average interest-earning asset yield variance explanations discussed above. Excluding the impact of loan fees collected in lieu of interest in both 2020 and 2019, the yield on average loans and leases receivable for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.97%, a decrease of 130 basis points compared to 5.27% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.99% for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 110 basis points from 2.09% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average rate paid declined as the Corporation decreased deposit rates in response to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (“FOMC”) decision to lower the target federal funds rate 225 basis points from July 2019 to March 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the average target federal funds rate decreased 174 basis points. In addition to the reduction in deposit rates, average wholesale deposits, which are typically longer duration and therefore a higher cost funding source than in-market deposits, decreased $82.7 million, or 36.7%.
Consistent with the Corporation’s longstanding funding strategy to manage interest rate risk and use the most efficient and cost effective source of wholesale funds, a combination of fixed rate wholesale deposits and fixed rate FHLB advances are used at various maturity terms to meet the Corporation’s funding needs. Average FHLB advances for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $93.4 million to $379.9 million at an average rate paid of 1.45%. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average original maturity of our FHLB term advances was 5.5 years, compared to 5.4 years as of December 31, 2019. Average wholesale deposits, consisting of brokered certificates of deposit and deposits gathered from internet listing services, for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $82.7 million to $142.6 million at an average rate paid of 1.71%. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average original maturity of our wholesale deposits was 4.1 years, compared to 5.3 years as of December 31, 2019. The rate paid on average wholesale funding is greater than the cost of in-market deposits and changes more gradually because the portfolio includes longer original maturities as the Corporation match-funds its longer-term fixed rate loans to mitigate interest rates risk.
Net interest margin decreased 21 basis points to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 3.61% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding fees collected in lieu of interest, PPP loan interest income, Federal Reserve interest income, and FHLB dividends net interest margin measured 3.28% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 3.33% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average yield on loans and leases receivable partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on in-market deposits and wholesale funding.
Management believes its success in growing in-market deposits, disciplined loan pricing, and increased production in existing higher-yielding specialty finance lines of business will allow the Corporation to achieve a net interest margin of at least 3.50%, on average, over the long-term. However, the collection of loan fees in lieu of interest is an expected source of volatility to quarterly net interest income and net interest margin, particularly given the nature of the Corporation’s asset-based lending business and the Corporation’s participation in the PPP. Net interest margin may also experience volatility due to events such as the collection of interest on loans previously in non-accrual status or the accumulation of significant short-term deposit inflows.
Despite an uncertain rate environment, management expects to effectively manage the Corporation’s liability structure in both term and rate. Further, we expect to attract new in-market deposit relationships which we believe will contribute to our ability to maintain an appropriate cost of funds. Period end in-market deposits - comprised of all transaction accounts, money market accounts, and non-wholesale deposits - increased $304.1 million, or 22.1%, to $1.683 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.379 billion at December 31, 2019. Average in-market deposits increased $297.4 million, or 23.4%, to $1.569 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.271 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This significant increase in deposits was due to successful business development efforts combined with excess liquidity resulting from our clients participation in the PPP.
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
We determine our provision for loan and lease losses pursuant to our allowance for loan and lease loss methodology, which is based on the magnitude of current and historical net charge-offs recorded throughout the established look-back period, the evaluation of several qualitative factors for each portfolio category, and the amount of specific reserves established for impaired loans that present collateral shortfall positions. Refer to Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, below, for further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease loss methodology.
The full impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain. It has caused substantial disruption in international and U.S. economies, markets, and employment. The outbreak is having a significant adverse impact on certain industries the Corporation serves, including retail, hospitality, entertainment, and restaurants and food services. Due to COVID-19 and the economic impact it could have on the Corporation’s loan portfolio, additional detail about certain exposure to stressed industries is included in the section titled COVID-19 Update, above.
Provision for loan and lease losses increased to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses included $8.1 million in charge-offs, partially offset by the release of $5.2 million in related specific reserves. The 2020 charge-off activity was principally driven by a $3.3 million charge-off for a previously reserved legacy SBA loan in the restaurant industry and a $2.8 million charge-off for a previously reserved conventional loan in the hospitality industry. In addition, changes in the general reserve increased the provision for loan and lease losses $949,000 due to historical loss rate updates from net charge-off activity, $5.5 million due to qualitative factor changes related to the uncertainty of the economic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and $2.3 million commensurate with an increase in loan and lease receivables.
The following table shows the components of the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The legacy on-balance sheet SBA portfolio, defined as SBA 7(a) and Express loans originated in 2016 and prior, has been a source of elevated non-performing assets. Additional information on our legacy SBA portfolio is as follows:
The addition of specific reserves on impaired loans represents new specific reserves established when collateral shortfalls or government guaranty deficiencies are present, while conversely the release of specific reserves represents the reduction of previously established reserves that are no longer required. Changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses due to subjective factor changes reflect management’s evaluation of the level of risk within the portfolio based upon several factors for each portfolio segment. Charge-offs in excess of previously established specific reserves require an additional provision for loan and lease losses to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level deemed appropriate by management. This amount is net of the release of any specific reserve that may have already been provided. Change in the inherent risk of the portfolio is primarily influenced by the overall growth in gross loans and leases and an analysis of loans previously charged off, as well as movement of existing loans and leases in and out of an impaired loan classification where a specific evaluation of a
particular credit may be required rather than the application of a general reserve loss rate. Refer to Asset Quality, below, for further information regarding the overall credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio.
Because of the significant uncertainties related to the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential effects on clients and prospects, and on the national and local economy as a whole, there can be no assurances as to how the crisis may ultimately affect the Corporation’s loan portfolio.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income increased by $3.5 million, or 15.0%, to $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management continues to focus on revenue growth from multiple non-interest income sources in order to maintain a diversified revenue stream through greater contribution from fee-based revenues. Total non-interest income accounted for 25.9% of our total revenues in 2020 compared to 25.1% in 2019, exceeding our long-term goal of 25% for the second consecutive year.
The increase in total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected record commercial loan interest rate swap fee income and a significant increase in gains on the sale of SBA loans, partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest income.
The components of non-interest income were as follows:
(1)Fee income ratio is fee income, per the above table, divided by top line revenue (defined as net interest income plus non-interest income).
Private wealth management services fee income increased by $414,000, or 5.1%, to a record $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Private wealth management services fee income is primarily driven by the amount of assets under management and administration, as well as the mix of business at different fee structures, and can be positively or negatively influenced by the timing and magnitude of volatility within the capital markets. This increase was driven by growth in assets under management and administration attributable to both new client relationships and increased equity market values. At December 31, 2020, our trust assets under management and administration were a record $2.249 billion, or 18.9% more than trust assets under management and administration of $1.892 billion at December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to increase our revenue from assets under management and administration as we deepen existing and grow new client relationships in our less mature commercial bank markets, but market volatility may also affect the actual change in revenue.
Commercial loan swap fees increased by $2.7 million to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We originate commercial real estate loans in which we offer clients a floating rate and an interest rate swap. The client’s swap is then offset with a counter-party dealer. The execution of these transactions generates swap fee income. The aggregate amortizing notional value of interest rate swaps with various borrowers was $629.1 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $326.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Interest rate swaps continue to be an attractive product for our commercial borrowers, although associated fee income can be variable from period to period based on client demand and the interest rate environment in any given quarter.
Gain on sale of SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $2.9 million, an increase of $1.4 million, or 98.7%, from the same period in 2019. Gross SBA loan commitments closed for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $42.5 million, compared to $24.4 million for the same period in 2019. Based on this recent activity, an enhanced business development team, and a growing pipeline of new business, management believes the annual gain on sale of SBA loans will continue to increase at a measured pace moving forward.
Other non-interest income decreased by $1.6 million to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The prior year period included above average returns from the Corporation’s investments in mezzanine funds and gains recognized on end-of-term buyout agreements related to the Corporation’s equipment finance business line.
Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expense increased by $2.2 million, or 3.3%, to $68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $66.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating expense, which excludes certain one-time and discrete items as defined in the Efficiency Ratio table above, increased $3.5 million, or 5.6%, to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in operating expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation, computer software expense, FDIC insurance, and collateral liquidation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and other non-interest expense.
The components of non-interest expense were as follows:
NM = Not meaningful
(1)Total operating expense represents total non-interest expense, adjusted to exclude the impact of discrete items as previously defined in the non-GAAP efficiency ratio calculation above.
Compensation expense increased by $3.8 million, or 9.1%, to $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase reflects new hires, annual merit increases, growth in employee benefit costs, and an increase in individual incentive compensation. Average full-time equivalent employees (“FTE”) were 301 for the three months ended December 31, 2020, increasing by 16, or 5.6%, from 285 for the three months ended December 31, 2019. We believe we will continue to generate modest positive operating leverage and progress towards enhancing our long-term efficiency ratio at a measured pace as we focus on strategic initiatives directed toward revenue growth.
These initiatives include efforts to expand our specialty finance lines of business, increase our commercial banking market share, and scale our private wealth management business in our less mature commercial banking markets. We expect to continue investing in talent, both in the form of additional business development and operational staff, to support our long-term strategic plan.
Computer software expense increased by $486,000, or 14.2%, to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was principally due to investments in technology platforms to improve the client experience and continuing our strategic focus on scaling the Corporation to efficiently execute our growth strategy.
FDIC insurance expense increased $597,000, or 93.1%, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $641,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. FDIC insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 benefited from a reduction in FDIC insurance expense as the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) reached 1.38%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% and requiring the FDIC to distribute assessment credits to small banks for their portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio. The Corporation received a credit of $458,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Management expects FDIC insurance expense to increase commensurate with asset growth going forward.
Collateral liquidation costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $328,000 compared to $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflects our special assets team’s continued efforts to exit impaired legacy SBA loans.
The Corporation incurred a $744,000 loss, recognized through non-interest expense, on the early extinguishment of $59.5 million in FHLB term advances late in the second quarter of 2020, as the Corporation lowered wholesale funding costs and improved the Corporation’s funding position. Management believes this strategy will help stabilize net interest margin with the expectation of a low interest rate environment for an extended period of time.
Marketing expense decreased by $641,000, or 28.9%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2020, the Corporation’s adherence to COVID-19 restrictions resulted in a reduction in marketing expenses, such as meals and entertainment, and advertisement expense.
Other non-interest expense decreased by $942,000, or 23.6%, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was principally due to a decrease in general business-related expenses due to the Corporation’s adherence to COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, the prior year included a one-time right-of-use impairment of $299,000 from vacating and subleasing unused office space in our Kansas City market. The decline in other non-interest expense was partially offset by a $461,000 credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) related to the commercial loan interest rate swap program. The CVA represents a change in the market value of the Company’s commercial loan interest rate swaps to estimate potential borrower credit risk within the portfolio. The CVA can vary from period to period based on the size of the portfolio, credit metrics, and the interest rate environment in any given quarter. There was no CVA for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Impairment on tax credit investments decreased $1.7 million, or 41.5%, to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The impairment on tax credit investments is related to historic rehabilitation tax credits and new market tax credits that are more than offset by a reduction to income tax expense, which, including the aforementioned gain on state tax credits, results in a net benefit to earnings. The Corporation recognized $1.9 million of impairment associated with the recognition of $2.8 million in federal historic tax credits in 2020, compared to $3.6 million of impairment associated with the recognition of $5.2 million in federal historic tax credits in 2019.
SBA recourse provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a benefit of $278,000 compared to expense of $188,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The total recourse reserve balance was $723,000, or 0.9% of total sold SBA loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.3 million, or 1.8% of total sold SBA loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019. Changes to SBA recourse reserves may be a source of non-interest expense volatility in future quarters, though the magnitude of this volatility should continue to diminish over time as the outstanding balance of sold legacy SBA loans continues to decline.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Corporation recognized federal historic tax credits in both 2020 and 2019, which reduced income tax expense by $2.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 7.2% compared to 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate, excluding tax credits and other discrete items, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 19.5% compared to 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
General
At December 31, 2020 total assets were $2.568 billion, representing an increase of $471.1 million, or 22.5%, from $2.097 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by an increase in loans and leases receivable, other assets, and securities available-for-sale, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments. The increase in loans and leases receivable was principally due to the Corporation’s participation in the PPP program and an increase in commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $228.9 million in PPP loans outstanding and $3.5 million in deferred processing fees outstanding.
Short-term investments
Short-term investments decreased by $23.6 million to $27.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $51.0 million at December 31, 2019. Short-term investments primarily consist of interest-bearing deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) and commercial paper. We value the safety and soundness provided by the FRB, and therefore, we incorporate short-term investments in our on-balance sheet liquidity program. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB were $26.7 million and $44.4 million, respectively. Although the majority of short-term investments consist of deposits with the FRB, we also make investments in commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, we did not hold any commercial paper, compared to a total of $5.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Due to current economic conditions, we decided to temporarily exit this short-term investment. We approach our decisions to purchase commercial paper with similar rigor and underwriting standards as applied to our loan and lease portfolio. The original maturities of the commercial paper are usually 60 days or less and provide an attractive yield in comparison to other short-term alternatives. These investments also assist us in maintaining a shorter duration of our overall investment portfolio which we believe is necessary to be in a position to benefit from an anticipated change in the yield curve level and shape. In general, the level of our short-term investments will be influenced by the timing of deposit gathering, scheduled maturities of wholesale deposits, funding of loan and lease growth when opportunities are presented, and the level of our securities portfolio. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion.
Securities
Total securities, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, increased by $4.5 million to $210.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $205.8 million at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total securities portfolio had a weighted average estimated maturity of approximately 5.0 years and 4.4 years, respectively. The investment portfolio primarily consists of mortgage-backed securities and is used to provide a source of liquidity, including the ability to pledge securities for possible future cash advances, while contributing to the earnings potential of the Bank. The overall duration of the securities portfolio is established and maintained to further mitigate interest rate risk present within our balance sheet as identified through asset/liability simulations. We purchase investment securities intended to protect net interest margin while maintaining an acceptable risk profile. In addition, we will purchase investment securities to utilize our cash position effectively within appropriate policy guidelines and estimates of future cash demands. While mortgage-backed securities present prepayment risk and extension risk, we believe the overall credit risk associated with these investments is minimal, as the majority of the securities we hold are guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), or the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), a U.S. government agency. The estimated repayment streams associated with this portfolio also allow us to better match short-term liabilities. The Bank’s investment policies allow for various types of investments, including tax-exempt municipal securities. The ability to invest in tax-exempt municipal securities provides for further opportunity to improve our overall yield on the securities portfolio. We evaluate the credit risk of the municipal securities prior to purchase and generally limit exposure to general obligation issuances from municipalities, primarily in Wisconsin.
The majority of the securities we hold have active trading markets; therefore, we have not experienced difficulties in pricing our securities. We use a third-party pricing service as our primary source of market prices for the securities portfolio. On a quarterly basis, we validate the reasonableness of prices received from this source through independent verification of the
portfolio, data integrity validation through comparison of current price to prior period prices, and an expectation-based analysis of movement in prices based upon the changes in the related yield curves and other market factors. On a periodic basis, we review the third-party pricing vendor’s methodology for pricing relevant securities and the results of its internal control assessments. Our securities portfolio is sensitive to fluctuations in the interest rate environment and has limited sensitivity to credit risk due to the nature of the issuers and guarantors of the securities as previously discussed. If interest rates decline and the credit quality of the securities remains constant or improves, the fair value of our debt securities portfolio would likely improve, thereby increasing total comprehensive income. If interest rates increase and the credit quality of the securities remains constant or deteriorates, the fair value of our debt securities portfolio would likely decline and therefore decrease total comprehensive income. The magnitude of the fair value change will be based upon the duration of the portfolio. A securities portfolio with a longer average duration will exhibit greater market price volatility than a securities portfolio with a shorter average duration in a changing rate environment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized unrealized holding gains of $3.5 million before income taxes through other comprehensive income. These gains were the result of a decrease in interest rates. No securities within our portfolio were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2020. We sold approximately $839,000 of securities during the year ended December 31, 2020 to proactively manage our securities portfolio and meet our long-term investment objectives. As of December 31, 2020 no securities were classified as trading securities. At December 31, 2020, $73.7 million of our securities were pledged to secure various obligations, including interest rate swap contracts and municipal deposits.
The tables below set forth information regarding the amortized cost and fair values of our securities.
U.S. government agency securities - government-sponsored enterprises represent securities issued by FNMA and the SBA. Municipal securities include securities issued by various municipalities located primarily within Wisconsin and are primarily general obligation bonds that are tax-exempt in nature. Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities -
government issued represent securities guaranteed by GNMA. Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities - government-sponsored enterprises include securities guaranteed by FHLMC, FNMA, and the FHLB. Other securities represent certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions with an original maturity greater than three months. As of December 31, 2020, no issuer's securities exceeded 10% of our total stockholders' equity.
The following table sets forth the contractual maturity and weighted average yield characteristics of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and the amortized cost of our held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2020, classified by remaining contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers have the right to call or prepay securities without call or prepayment penalties. Yields on tax-exempt securities have not been computed on a tax equivalent basis.
Derivative Activities
The Bank’s investment policies allow the Bank to participate in hedging strategies or to use financial futures, options, forward commitments, or interest rate swaps with prior approval from the Board. The Bank utilizes, from time to time, derivative instruments in the course of their asset/liability management. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank did not hold any derivative instruments that were designated as fair value hedges. The Corporation offers interest rate swap products directly to qualified commercial borrowers. The Corporation economically hedges client derivative transactions by entering into offsetting interest rate swap contracts executed with a third party. Derivative transactions executed as part of this program are not considered hedging instruments and are marked-to-market through earnings each period. The derivative contracts have mirror-image terms, which results in the positions’ changes in fair value offsetting through earnings each period. The credit risk and risk of non-performance embedded in the fair value calculations is different between the dealer counterparties and the commercial borrowers which may result in a difference in the changes in the fair value of the mirror-image swaps. The Corporation incorporates credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) to appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the counterparty’s risk in the fair value measurements. When evaluating the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effects of non-performance and credit risk, the Corporation considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements
such as collateral postings, thresholds, and guarantees. As of December 31, 2020, the CVA reflecting the non-performance risk of the borrower was $461,000. There was no CVA as of December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amortizing notional value of interest rate swaps with various commercial borrowers was approximately $629.1 million. We receive fixed rates and pay floating rates based upon LIBOR on the swaps with commercial borrowers. These swaps mature between March 2021 and December 2037. Commercial borrower swaps are completed independently with each borrower and are not subject to master netting arrangements. These commercial borrower swaps were reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a derivative asset of $49.4 million, included in accrued interest receivable and other assets, and as a derivative liability of $58,000, included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. On the offsetting swap contracts with dealer counterparties, we pay fixed rates and receive floating rates based upon LIBOR. These interest rate swaps also have maturity dates between March 2021 and December 2037. Dealer counterparty swaps are subject to master netting agreements among the contracts within our Bank and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a net derivative liability of $49.3 million, included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. The gross amount of dealer counterparty swaps, without regard to the enforceable master netting agreement, was a gross derivative liability of $49.4 million and a gross derivative asset of $58,000.
The Corporation also enters into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk and reduce the cost of match-funding certain long-term fixed rate loans. These derivative contracts involve the receipt of floating rate interest from a counterparty in exchange for the Corporation making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement, without the exchange of the underlying notional value. The instruments are designated as cash flow hedges as the receipt of floating rate interest from the counterparty is used to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of short-term FHLB advances. The change in the fair value of these hedging instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transactions affects earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was $114.0 million. These interest rate swaps mature between December 2021 and December 2027. A pre-tax unrealized loss of $3.0 million was recognized in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and there was no ineffective portion of these hedges.
Loans and Leases Receivable
Loans and leases receivable, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, increased by $422.3 million, or 24.9%, to $2.117 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.695 billion at December 31, 2019. Excluding net PPP loans, loans and leases receivable, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, increased by $197.0 million, or 11.62%, to $1.892 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.695 billion at December 31, 2019. Multifamily, commercial real estate non-owner occupied, and construction loans were the largest contributors to CRE loan growth as of December 31, 2020, increasing $94.2 million, $47.9 million, and $32.0 million, respectively, from December 31, 2019.
There continues to be a concentration in CRE loans which represented 70.6% and 67.3% of our total loans, excluding net PPP loans, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 18.7% of the CRE loans were owner-occupied CRE, compared to 19.6% as of December 31, 2019. We consider owner-occupied CRE more characteristic of the Corporation’s C&I portfolio as, in general, the client’s primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the operating entity occupying the commercial real estate property. Management has elevated its underwriting standards during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure business owners and guarantors have robust liquidity, operating performance, and collateral positions. Even with these higher standards, the Corporation has been able to grow loans and deepen banking relationships.
Our C&I portfolio increased $228.9 million, or 45.5%, to $732.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $503.4 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding net PPP loans, C&I loans increased $3.6 million to $507.0 million from $503.4 million at December 31, 2019. C&I growth in 2020 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related government stimulus, which reduced the line of credit usage we typically see from our existing C&I clients, specifically our asset-based and accounts receivable clients. C&I lines of credit usage decreased $41.7 million, or 14.7%, to $241.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $282.9 million at December 31, 2019. Some of our specialty finance products have historically experienced counter cyclical growth, growing during times of economic stress and uncertainty. While the Corporation did not experience asset-based loan growth in 2020, management expects asset-based loans and accounts receivable financing volume to increase in 2021. We will continue to actively pursue C&I loans across the Corporation as this segment of our loan and lease portfolio provides an attractive yield commensurate with an appropriate level of credit risk and creates opportunities for in-market deposit, treasury management, and private wealth management relationships which generate additional fee revenue.
Underwriting of new credit is primarily through approval from a serial sign-off or committee process and is a key component of our operating philosophy. Business development officers have no individual lending authority limits, and thus, a significant portion of our new credit extensions require approval from a loan approval committee regardless of the type of loan or lease, amount of the credit, or the related complexities of each proposal. In addition, we make every reasonable effort to ensure that there is appropriate collateral or a government guarantee at the time of origination to protect our interest in the
related loan or lease. To monitor the ongoing credit quality of our loans and leases, each credit is evaluated for proper risk rating using a nine grade risk rating system at the time of origination, subsequent renewal, evaluation of updated financial information from our borrowers, or as other circumstances dictate.
While we continue to experience significant competition from banks operating in our primary geographic areas, we remain committed to our underwriting standards and will not deviate from those standards for the sole purpose of growing our loan and lease portfolio. We continue to expect our new loan and lease activity to be adequate to replace normal amortization, allowing us to continue growing in future years.
The following table presents information concerning the composition of the Bank’s consolidated loans and leases receivable.
The following table shows the scheduled contractual maturities of the Bank’s consolidated gross loans and leases receivable, as well as the dollar amount of such loans and leases which are scheduled to mature after one year and have fixed or adjustable interest rates, as of December 31, 2020.
Commercial Real Estate. The Bank originates owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which have fixed or adjustable rates and generally terms of three to 10 years and amortizations of up to 30 years on existing commercial real estate. The Bank also originates loans to construct commercial properties and complete land development projects. The Bank’s construction loans generally have terms of six to 24 months with fixed or adjustable interest rates and fees that are due at the time of origination. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as project inspections warrant.
The repayment of commercial real estate loans generally is dependent on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Payments on commercial real estate loans are often dependent on external market conditions impacting the successful operation or development of the property or business involved. Therefore, repayment of such loans is often sensitive to conditions in the real estate market or the general economy, which are outside the borrower’s control. In the event that the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan could be negatively impacted. The deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a material increase in our level of nonperforming loans, which would result in a loss of revenue from these loans and could result in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our net income. Additionally, many of these loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of economic conditions. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could impact collateral coverage associated with the commercial real estate segment of our portfolio, possibly leading to increased specific reserves or charge-offs, which would adversely affect profitability. Of the $1.359 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020, $28.7 million were originated by our asset-based lending subsidiary.
Commercial and Industrial. The Bank’s commercial and industrial loan portfolio is comprised of loans for a variety of purposes which principally are secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, machinery, and other corporate assets and are advanced within limits prescribed by our loan policy. The majority of such loans are secured and typically backed by personal guarantees of the owners of the borrowing business. Of the $732.3 million of C&I loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020, $290.3 million were conventional C&I loans, $228.9 million were PPP loans, $85.8 million were asset-based loans, $73.1 million were equipment finance loans, $37.2 million were purchased accounts receivable, and $17.1 million were floorplan loans. The asset-based loans, including accounts receivable purchased on a full recourse basis, are typically secured by the borrower’s accounts receivable and inventory. These loans generally have higher interest rates and non-origination fees collected in lieu of interest and the collateral supporting the credit is closely monitored. Additionally, asset-based borrowers are usually highly-leveraged and/or have inconsistent historical earnings. Significant adverse changes in various industries could cause rapid declines in values and collectability associated with those business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to future losses.
SBA Lending. SBA loans are made through programs designed by the federal government to assist the small business community in obtaining financing. As an SBA Preferred Lender, our loans (excluding PPP loans) fall into three categories: loans originated under the SBA’s 7(a) term loan program; loans originated under the SBA’s 504 program; and SBA Express loans and lines of credit. The majority of our SBA loans are originated under the 7(a) term loan program. Historically we have sold the guaranteed portions of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market and retained the non-guaranteed portions. SBA lending is a significant part of our strategic business plan. The success of our SBA lending program is dependent upon the continued availability of SBA loan programs, our status as a Preferred Lender, our ability to effectively compete and originate new SBA loans, and our ability to comply with applicable SBA lending requirements. As of December 31, 2020, the on-balance sheet portion of SBA loans, excluding PPP loans, that were included in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio was $33.2 million, commercial real estate loan portfolio was $12.6 million, and consumer and other was $451,000.
Direct Financing Leases. Direct financing leases initiated through FBSF are originated with a fixed rate and typically a term of seven years or less. It is customary in the leasing industry to provide 100% financing; however, FBSF will, from time-to-time, require a down payment or lease deposit to provide a credit enhancement. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $22.3 million in net direct financing receivables outstanding.
FBSF leases machinery and equipment to clients under leases which qualify as direct financing leases for financial reporting and as operating leases for income tax purposes. Under the direct financing method of accounting, the minimum lease payments to be received under the lease contract, together with the estimated unguaranteed residual value (approximating 3% to 20% of the cost of the related equipment), are recorded as lease receivables when the lease is signed and the lease property is delivered to the client. The excess of the minimum lease payments and residual values over the cost of the equipment is recorded as unearned lease income. Unearned lease income is recognized over the term of the lease on a basis which results in a level rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Lease payments are recorded when due under the lease contract. Residual value is the estimated fair market value of the equipment on lease at lease termination and was estimated to be $5.4 million as of December 31, 2020. In estimating the equipment’s fair value, FBSF relies on historical experience by equipment type and manufacturer, published sources of used equipment pricing, internal evaluations and, when available, valuations by independent appraisers, adjusted for known trends.
Consumer and Other. The Bank originates a small amount of consumer loans consisting of home equity, first and second mortgages, and other personal loans for professional and executive clients of the Bank.
Asset Quality
Non-accrual loans and leases increased $6.0 million, or 29.1%, to $26.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $20.6 million at December 31, 2019.
Our total impaired assets consisted of the following:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $6.5 million and $15.6 million of the non-accrual loans were considered troubled debt restructurings, respectively. As noted in the table above, non-performing assets consisted of non-accrual loans and leases and foreclosed properties totaling $26.7 million, or 1.04% of total assets, as of December 31, 2020, an increase in non-performing assets of $3.1 million, or 13.3%, from December 31, 2019. Impaired loans and leases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 also included $46,000 and $140,000, respectively, of loans that are performing troubled debt restructurings, which are considered impaired due to the concession in terms, but are meeting the restructured payment terms and therefore are not on non-accrual status.
The following asset quality ratios exclude net PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA:
We use a wide variety of available metrics to assess the overall asset quality of the portfolio and no one metric is used independently to make a final conclusion as to the asset quality of the portfolio. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 1.04% at December 31, 2020 from 1.12% at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the payment performance of our loans and leases did not point to any new areas of concern, as approximately 99.0% of the total portfolio was in a current payment status, compared to 99.1% as of December 31, 2019. We also monitor asset quality through our established categories as defined in Note 5 - Loan and Lease Receivables, Impaired Loans and Leases and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As we continue to actively monitor the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolios, we may identify additional loans and leases for which the borrowers or lessees are having difficulties making the required principal and interest payments based upon factors including, but not limited to, the inability to sell the underlying collateral, inadequate cash flow from the operations of the underlying businesses, liquidation events, or bankruptcy filings. We are proactively working with our impaired loan borrowers to find meaningful solutions to difficult situations that are in the best interests of the Bank.
In 2020, as well as in all previous reporting periods, there were no loans over 90 days past due and still accruing interest. Loans and leases greater than 90 days past due are considered impaired and are placed on non-accrual status. Cash received while a loan or a lease is on non-accrual status is generally applied solely against the outstanding principal. If collectability of the contractual principal and interest is not in doubt, payments received may be applied to both interest due on a cash basis and principal.
Additional information about impaired loans is as follows:
Impaired loans and leases with no impairment reserves represent impaired loans where the collateral, based upon current information, is deemed to be sufficient or that have been partially charged-off to reflect our net realizable value of the loan. When analyzing the adequacy of collateral, we obtain external appraisals as appropriate. Our policy regarding commercial real estate appraisals requires the utilization of appraisers from our approved list, the performance of independent reviews to monitor the quality of such appraisals, and receipt of new appraisals for impaired loans at least annually, or more frequently as circumstances warrant. We make adjustments to the appraised values for appropriate selling costs. In addition, the ordering of appraisals and review of the appraisals are performed by individuals who are independent of the business development process.
Based on the specific evaluation of the collateral of each impaired loan, we believe the reserve for impaired loans was appropriate at December 31, 2020. However, we cannot provide assurance that the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual impaired loan will not change and that the specific reserve or current carrying value will not be different in the future, which may require additional charge-offs or specific reserves to be recorded.
Foreclosed properties are recorded at fair value of the underlying property, less costs to sell. If, at the time of foreclosure, the fair value less cost to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan, the difference is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses prior to the transfer to foreclosed property. The fair value is based on an appraisal, discounted cash flow analysis (the majority of which is based on current occupancy and lease rates) or a verifiable offer to purchase. After foreclosure, valuation allowances or future write-downs to net realizable value are charged directly to non-interest expense. Foreclosed properties of $34,000 were outstanding as of December 31, 2020, compared to $2.9 million as of December 31, 2019. We recorded impairment losses of approximately $363,000 and $224,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recorded a net loss of $20,000 on the sale of existing foreclosed properties for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to no sales of existing foreclosed property for the year ended December 31, 2019. We continue to evaluate possible exit strategies on our impaired loans when foreclosure action may be probable and our level of foreclosed assets may increase in the future. Loans are transferred to foreclosed properties when we claim ownership rights to the properties.
A summary of foreclosed properties activity is as follows:
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $9.0 million, or 46.1%, to $28.5 million as of December 31, 2020 from $19.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of gross loans and leases also increased to 1.33% as of December 31, 2020 from 1.14% as of December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of gross loans and leases, excluding net PPP loans, was 1.48% as of December 31, 2020. The increase in allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of gross loans and leases was principally driven by COVID-19 and the economic impact it is having on the Corporation’s loan portfolio. For year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was in large part due to an increase in several qualitative factors after careful evaluation by management. Most notably, a $5.5 million increase was due to the economic conditions caused by the pandemic, including the increase in the unemployment rate, management’s ongoing review and grading of the loan and lease portfolios, consideration of delinquency experience, and the level of loans and leases subject to more frequent review by management. Additionally, the general reserve increased $2.3 million commensurate with loan growth, and $949,000 due to historical loss rate updates to include current year net charge-off activity.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net charge-offs on impaired loans and leases of approximately $7.8 million, which included $8.1 million of charge-offs and $332,000 of recoveries. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded net charge-offs on impaired loans and leases of approximately $3.0 million, which included $3.4 million of charge-offs and $366,000 of recoveries. The 2020 charge-off activity was principally driven by a $3.3 million charge-off for a previously reserved legacy SBA loan in the restaurant industry and a $2.8 million charge-off for a previously reserved conventional loan in the hospitality industry.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our allowance for loan and lease losses to total non-accrual loans and leases was 107.15% and 94.70%, respectively. This ratio increased primarily due to the increase in allowance for loan and lease losses discussed above. Impaired loans and leases exhibit weaknesses that inhibit repayment in compliance with the original terms of the note or lease. However, the measurement of impairment on loans and leases may not always result in a specific reserve included in the allowance for loan and lease losses. As part of the underwriting process, as well as our ongoing monitoring efforts, we try to ensure that we have sufficient collateral to protect our interest in the related loan or lease. As a result of this practice, a significant portion of our outstanding balance of non-performing loans or leases either does not require additional
specific reserves or requires only a minimal amount of required specific reserve, as we believe the loans and leases are adequately collateralized as of the measurement period. In addition, management is proactive in recording charge-offs to bring loans to their net realizable value in situations where it is determined with certainty that we will not recover the entire amount of our principal. This practice may lead to a lower allowance for loan and lease loss to non-accrual loans and leases ratio as compared to our peers or industry expectations. As asset quality strengthens, our allowance for loan and lease losses is measured more through general characteristics, including historical loss experience, of our portfolio rather than through specific identification and we would therefore expect this ratio to rise. Conversely, if we identify further impaired loans, this ratio could fall if the impaired loans are adequately collateralized and therefore require no specific or general reserve. Given our business practices and evaluation of our existing loan and lease portfolio, we believe this coverage ratio is appropriate for the probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2020.
To determine the level and composition of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we break out the portfolio by segments with similar risk characteristics. First, we evaluate loans and leases for potential impairment classification. We analyze each loan and lease identified as impaired on an individual basis to determine a specific reserve based upon the estimated value of the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans, or alternatively, the present value of expected cash flows. For each segment of loans and leases that has not been individually evaluated, management segregates the Bank’s loss factors into a quantitative general reserve component based on historical loss rates throughout the defined look back period. The quantitative general reserve component also considers an estimate of the historical loss emergence period, which is the period of time between the event that triggers the loss to the charge-off of that loss. The methodology also focuses on evaluation of several qualitative factors for each portfolio category, including but not limited to: management’s ongoing review and grading of the loan and lease portfolios, consideration of delinquency experience, changes in the size of the loan and lease portfolios, existing economic conditions, level of loans and leases subject to more frequent review by management, changes in underlying collateral, concentrations of loans to specific industries, and other qualitative factors that could affect credit losses.
When it is determined that we will not receive our entire contractual principal or the loss is confirmed, we record a charge against the allowance for loan and lease loss reserve to bring the loan or lease to its net realizable value. Many of the impaired loans as of December 31, 2020 are collateral dependent. It is typically part of our process to obtain appraisals on impaired loans and leases that are primarily secured by real estate or equipment at least annually, or more frequently as circumstances warrant. As we have completed new appraisals and/or market evaluations, we have found that in general real estate values have been stable or improved; however, in specific situations current fair values collateralizing certain impaired loans were inadequate to support the entire amount of the outstanding debt. Foreclosure actions may have been initiated on certain of these commercial real estate and other mortgage loans.
As a result of our review process, we have concluded an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses for the existing loan and lease portfolio was $28.5 million, or 1.33% of gross loans and leases, at December 31, 2020. However, given ongoing complexities with current workout situations and the uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions, further charge-offs, and increased provisions for loan and lease losses may be recorded if additional facts and circumstances lead us to a different conclusion. In addition, various federal and state regulatory agencies review the allowance for loan and lease losses. These agencies could require certain loan and lease balances to be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
A summary of the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses follows:
We review our methodology and periodically adjust allocation percentages of the allowance by segment, as reflected in the following table. Within the specific categories, certain loans or leases have been identified for specific reserve allocations as well as the whole category of that loan type or lease being reviewed for a general reserve based on the foregoing analysis of trends and overall balance growth within that category.
The table below shows our allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses by loan portfolio segments. The allocation of the allowance by segment is management’s best estimate of the inherent risk in the respective loan segments. Despite the specific allocation noted in the table below, the entire allowance is available to cover any loss.
(a)Allowance for loan losses category as a percentage of total loans by category.
Although we believe the allowance for loan and lease losses was appropriate based on the current level of loan and lease delinquencies, non-accrual loans and leases, trends in charge-offs, economic conditions, and other factors as of December 31, 2020, there can be no assurance that future adjustments to the allowance will not be necessary.
The following tables illustrate ending balances of the Corporation’s gross loan and lease receivable portfolio, segregated by Commercial Real Estate and All Other Loans, and considering certain credit quality indicators. Refer to Note 5 - Loan and Lease Receivables, Impaired Loans and Leases and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for risk category definitions.
Management’s ongoing review and grading of the loan and lease portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase of $82.4 million in Category II and $78.2 million increase in Category III loans from December 31, 2019, primarily due to migration of our commercial real estate portfolio. The commercial real estate loans are to borrowers operating within certain industries which have been and are expected to be particularly impacted by social distancing, quarantines, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as retail, hospitality, entertainment, and restaurants and food service. In general, our commercial real estate loans within these stressed industries are well-collateralized and include strong project sponsors. As a result of this process, we have concluded an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial real estate loan segment was $17.2 million, or 1.26% of total commercial real estate loans, at December 31, 2020, up from $10.9 million, or 0.94% of total commercial real estate loans, at December 31, 2019. Although we believe the allowance for loan and lease losses related to the commercial real estate portfolio was appropriate based on the current level of loan and lease
delinquencies, non-accrual loans and leases, trends in charge-offs, economic conditions, and other factors as of December 31, 2020, there can be no assurance that future adjustments to the allowance will not be necessary.
Deposits
As of December 31, 2020, deposits increased by $325.1 million to $1.856 billion from $1.530 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in transaction accounts, partially offset by a decrease in money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Transaction accounts increased $409.3 million to $976.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $567.5 million at December 31, 2019. Money market accounts decreased $32.9 million to $641.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $674.4 million at December 31, 2019. Transaction account balances increased primarily due to the influx of PPP loan proceeds and successful business development efforts. Management attributes the transition from money market accounts to reciprocal transaction accounts with full FDIC insurance to our clients’ preferences for liquidity and safety and soundness amid the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Certificates of deposit decreased $72.3 million to $64.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $137.0 million at December 31, 2019 as client preferences shifted away from term deposits due to the low interest rate environment. The decrease in certificates of deposit was partially offset by a $21.0 million increase in wholesale deposits, mainly due to adding non-maturity reciprocal deposits at a favorable rate compared to alternative funding sources. Excluding these deposits, wholesale deposits decreased as the existing portfolio runoff was replaced by in-market deposits and lower cost FHLB advances to match-fund long-term fixed rate loans and fund loan growth. Our strategic efforts remain focused on adding in-market deposit relationships. Successful deposit campaigns supporting our private wealth management strategy complemented our traditional strength in commercial banking and treasury management, contributing to substantial in-market deposit growth during 2020.
The following table presents the composition of the Bank’s consolidated deposits.
Deposit balances associated with in-market relationships will fluctuate based upon maturity of time deposits, client demands for the use of their cash, and our ability to service and maintain existing and new client relationships. Deposits continue to be the primary source of the Bank’s funding for lending and other investment activities. A variety of accounts are designed to attract both short- and long-term deposits. These accounts include non-interest-bearing transaction accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit terms offered by the Bank vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, the rates and products offered by competitors, and the interest rates charged on other sources of funds, among other factors. Our Bank’s in-market deposits are obtained primarily from the South Central, Northeast and Southeast regions of Wisconsin and the greater Kansas City Metro.
We measure the success of in-market deposit gathering efforts based on the average balances of our deposit accounts as compared to ending balances due to the volatility of some of our larger relationships. Average in-market deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $1.569 billion, or 74.47% of total bank funding. Total bank funding is defined as total deposits plus FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window advances, and Federal Reserve PPPLF advances. This compares to average in-market deposits of $1.271 billion, or 71.30% of total bank funding, for 2019. Refer to Note 10 - Deposits in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our deposit composition.
The following table sets forth the amount and maturities of the Bank’s certificates of deposit and term wholesale deposits at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, time deposits included $28.7 million of certificates of deposit and wholesale deposits in denominations greater than or equal to $250,000. Of these certificates, $17.2 million are scheduled to mature in three months or less, $2.8 million in greater than three through six months, $6.8 million in greater than six through twelve months and $1.9 million in greater than twelve months.
Of the total time deposits outstanding as of December 31, 2020, $101.7 million are scheduled to mature in 2021, $6.2 million in 2022, $1.2 million in 2023, $263,000 in 2024, $1.7 million in 2025 and $1.0 million thereafter. As of December 31, 2020, we have no wholesale certificates of deposit which the Bank has the right to call prior to the scheduled maturity.
Borrowings
We had total borrowings of $429.2 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $99.8 million, or 30.3%, from $329.4 million at December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the increase in borrowings was due to an increase in FHLB advances. While total wholesale funding as a percentage of total bank funding has decreased meaningfully overall due to significant in-market deposit growth, we continue to replace the majority of our maturing brokered certificates of deposit with FHLB advances at lower rates, as needed, to match-fund fixed rate loans and mitigate interest rate risk. Total bank funding is defined as total deposits plus FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window advances, and Federal Reserve PPPLF advances. During the second quarter of 2020, management tested the availability of the Federal Reserve PPPLF due to the uncertainty of when PPP loans would be required to close and fund and obtained a $29.6 million PPPLF advance. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had no PPPLF advances outstanding.
The Corporation incurred a $744,000 loss, recognized through non-interest expense, on the early extinguishment of $59.5 million in FHLB term advances late in the second quarter of 2020, as the Corporation lowered wholesale funding costs and improved the Corporation’s funding position. Management believes this strategy will help stabilize net interest margin with the expectation of a low interest rate environment for an extended period of time.
Consistent with our funding philosophy to manage interest rate risk, we will use the most efficient and cost effective source of wholesale funds. We will utilize FHLB advances to the extent we maintain an adequate level of excess borrowing capacity for liquidity and contingency funding purposes and pricing remains favorable in comparison to the wholesale deposit alternative. We will use FHLB advances and/or brokered certificates of deposit in specific maturity periods needed, typically three to five years, to match-fund fixed rate loans and effectively mitigate the interest rate risk measured through our asset/liability management process and to support asset growth initiatives while taking into consideration our operating goals and desired level of usage of wholesale funds. Please refer to the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, for further information regarding our use and monitoring of wholesale funds.
The following table sets forth the outstanding balances, weighted average balances, and weighted average interest rates for our borrowings (short-term and long-term) as indicated.
(1)Weighted average rate of subordinated notes payable reflects the accelerated amortization of subordinated debt issuance costs as a result of the early redemption of a subordinated note during the third quarter of 2019.
A summary of annual maturities of borrowings at December 31, 2020 is as follows:
On August 15, 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000 of subordinated notes to three qualified institutional buyers in a private placement. The subordinated notes, which were structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital, have a maturity date of August 15, 2029 and will bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% up to, but not including, August 15, 2024. From and including August 15, 2024 to the maturity date, the interest rate will reset quarterly, equal to the Floating Interest Rate (as defined in the Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement) of the applicable interest period plus 407 basis points. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund the redemption of $15,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due September 1, 2024, which also were structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital.
The following table sets forth maximum amounts outstanding at each month-end for specific types of short-term borrowings for the periods indicated. The maximum month-end balance has been the result of using advances with original maturities of up to 30 days to accommodate the orderly issuance of permanent wholesale funds, either in the form of brokered certificates of deposit or FHLB advances.
Stockholders’ Equity
As of December 31, 2020, stockholders’ equity was $206.2 million, or 8.0% of total assets, compared to stockholders’ equity of $194.2 million, or 9.3% of total assets, as of December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, stockholders’ equity was 8.8% of total assets. Stockholders’ equity increased by $12.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to net income of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by dividend declarations of $5.7 million and stock repurchases of $1.7 million.
In August 2019, the Corporation completed a $5 million share repurchase program which was initiated in December 2018 and had a termination date of December 31, 2019. The Corporation repurchased 223,149 shares under the repurchase program at an average price of $22.36 per share. On September 20, 2019, the Corporation announced its Board approved a new share repurchase program. The program authorized the repurchase by the Corporation of up to $5 million in aggregate value of its outstanding shares of common stock over a period of approximately twelve months, ending on September 30, 2020. The Corporation suspended this share repurchase program in March 2020 due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to suspending the program, the Corporation had repurchased $3.5 million of the $5 million authorized in the Company’s common stock.
On January 28, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved a new share repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase by the Corporation of up to $5.0 million of its total outstanding shares of common stock over a period of approximately twelve months, ending January 31, 2022.
Under the new share repurchase program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or negotiated transactions at prevailing market rates, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. In connection with the share repurchase program, the Corporation implemented a 10b5-1 trading plan. The trading plan allows the Corporation to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws by requiring that an agent selected by the Corporation repurchase shares of common stock on the Corporation’s behalf on pre-determined terms.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect to meet our liquidity needs through existing cash on hand, established cash flow sources, our third party senior line of credit, and dividends received from the Bank. While the Bank is subject to certain regulatory limitations regarding their ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, we do not believe that the Corporation will be adversely affected by these dividend limitations. The Corporation’s principal liquidity requirements at December 31, 2020 were the interest payments due on subordinated and junior subordinated notes. During 2020 and 2019, FBB declared and paid dividends totaling $12.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively. The capital ratios of the Bank met all applicable regulatory capital adequacy requirements in effect on December 31, 2020, and continue to meet the heightened requirements imposed by Basel III, including the capital conservation buffer that was fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019. The Corporation’s Board and management teams adhere to the appropriate regulatory guidelines on decisions which affect their capital positions, including but not limited to, decisions relating to the payment of dividends and increasing indebtedness.
The Bank maintains liquidity by obtaining funds from several sources. The Bank’s primary source of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage-related securities, deposits, and other borrowings, such as federal funds, FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window advances, and Federal Reserve PPPLF advances. The scheduled payments of loans and mortgage-related securities are generally a predictable source of funds. Deposit flows and loan prepayments, however, are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Please refer to the section titled COVID-19 Update for additional information on the Bank’s primary and secondary sources of available liquidity the during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We view on-balance sheet liquidity as a critical element to maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our cash and collateral obligations. We define our on-balance sheet liquidity as the total of our short-term investments, our unencumbered securities available-for-sale, and our unencumbered pledged loans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our immediate on-balance sheet liquidity was $640.2 million and $438.2 million, respectively. The significant increase as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is principally due to the Banks ability to pledge PPP loans and borrow from the Federal Reserve PPPLF. Excluding Federal Reserve PPPLF availability, immediate on-balance sheet liquidity as of December 31, 2020 was $414.9 million. This decline in on-balance sheet liquidity compared to 2019 is primarily due to the Banks increased use of FHLB advances to replace maturing brokered certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank had $26.7 million and $44.4 million on deposit with the FRB recorded in short-term investments, respectively. Any excess funds not used for loan funding or satisfying other cash obligations were maintained as part of our on-balance sheet liquidity in our interest-bearing accounts with the FRB, as we value the safety and soundness provided by the FRB. We plan to utilize excess liquidity to fund loan and lease portfolio growth, pay down maturing debt, allow run off of maturing wholesale certificates of deposit or invest in securities to maintain adequate liquidity at an improved margin.
We had $567.0 million of outstanding wholesale funds at December 31, 2020, compared to $446.5 million of wholesale funds as of December 31, 2019, which represented 25.2% and 24.5%, respectively, of ending balance total bank funding. Wholesale funds include FHLB advances, Federal Reserve PPPLF advances, brokered certificates of deposit, and deposits gathered from internet listing services. Total bank funding is defined as total deposits plus FHLB advances and Federal Reserve PPPLF advances. We are committed to raising in-market deposits while utilizing wholesale funds to mitigate interest rate risk. Wholesale funds continue to be an efficient and cost effective source of funding for the Bank and allows it to gather funds across a larger geographic base at price levels and maturities that are more attractive than local time deposits when required to raise a similar level of in-market deposits within a short time period. Access to such deposits and borrowings allows us the flexibility to refrain from pursuing single service deposit relationships in markets that have experienced unfavorable pricing levels. In addition, the administrative costs associated with wholesale funds are considerably lower than those that would be incurred to administer a similar level of local deposits with a similar maturity structure. During the time frames necessary to accumulate wholesale funds in an orderly manner, we will use short-term FHLB advances to meet our temporary funding needs. The short-term FHLB advances will typically have terms of one week to one month to cover the overall expected funding demands.
Period-end in-market deposits increased $304.1 million, or 22.1%, to $1.683 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.379 billion at December 31, 2019 as in-market deposit balances increased due to PPP loan proceeds and successful business development efforts. Our in-market relationships remain stable; however, deposit balances associated with those relationships will fluctuate. We expect to establish new client relationships and continue marketing efforts aimed at increasing the balances in existing clients’ deposit accounts. Nonetheless, we will continue to use wholesale funds in specific maturity periods, typically three to five years, needed to effectively mitigate the interest rate risk measured through our asset/liability management process
or in shorter time periods if in-market deposit balances decline. In order to provide for ongoing liquidity and funding, all of our wholesale funds are certificates of deposit which do not allow for withdrawal at the option of the depositor before the stated maturity (with the exception of deposits accumulated through the internet listing service which have the same early withdrawal privileges and fees as do our other in-market deposits) and FHLB advances with contractual maturity terms and no call provisions. The Bank limits the percentage of wholesale funds to total bank funds in accordance with liquidity policies approved by its Board. The Bank was in compliance with its policy limits as of December 31, 2020.
The Bank was able to access the wholesale funding market as needed at rates and terms comparable to market standards during the year ended December 31, 2020. In the event that there is a disruption in the availability of wholesale funds at maturity, the Bank has managed the maturity structure, in compliance with our approved liquidity policy, so at least one year of maturities could be funded through on-balance sheet liquidity. These potential funding sources include deposits maintained at the FRB or Federal Reserve Discount Window utilizing currently unencumbered securities and acceptable loans as collateral. As of December 31, 2020, the available liquidity was in excess of the stated policy minimum. We believe the Bank will also have access to the unused federal funds lines, cash flows from borrower repayments, and cash flows from security maturities. The Bank also has the ability to raise local market deposits by offering attractive rates to generate the level required to fulfill its liquidity needs.
The Bank is required by federal regulation to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. We believe that the Bank has sufficient liquidity to match the balance of net withdrawable deposits and short-term borrowings in light of present economic conditions and deposit flows.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of $26.6 million. Operating cash flows included net income of $17.0 million and a provision for loan and leases losses of $16.8 million, partially offset by a net increase in loans originated for sale and sold. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $454.5 million which consisted of cash outflows to fund net loan growth and the purchase of $8.0 million in additional bank-owned life insurance and the increase of $5.6 million in FHLB stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $417.7 million. Financing cash flows included a $325.1 million net increase in deposits and a $98.8 million net increase in FHLB advances used predominantly to fund net loan growth, partially offset by cash dividends paid and share repurchases of $5.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
Refer to Note 12 - Regulatory Capital for additional information regarding the Corporation’s and the Bank’s capital ratios and the ratios required by their federal regulators at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
Commitments
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate $654.1 million of loans and commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of clients pursuant to standby letters of credit of $8.1 million, which includes $300.2 million of commitments to extend funds beyond one year. We do not expect any losses as a result of these funding commitments. We have evaluated outstanding commitments associated with loans that were identified as impaired loans and concluded that there are no additional losses required to be recorded with these unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2020. We believe that additional commitments will not be granted or additional collateral will be provided to support any additional funds advanced. The Bank also utilizes interest rate swaps for the purposes of interest rate risk management, as described further in Note 17 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally the Corporation has remaining commitments of $1.3 million to Aldine Capital Fund II, LP (“Aldine II”), $2.1 million to Aldine Capital Fund III, LP (“Aldine III”), and $725,000 to Dane Workforce Housing Fund, LLC (“Workforce Fund”). Aldine II and Aldine III are private equity mezzanine funding limited partnerships in which we have invested. Aldine II began its operations in March 2013 and Aldine III began its operations in October 2018. The Workforce Fund was organized in 2020 to originate and administer investments for the purpose of alleviating the shortage of Affordable Workforce Housing Units in Dane County, Wisconsin.
We believe adequate capital and liquidity are available from various sources to fund projected commitments.
SBA Recourse
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation sells the guaranteed portions of SBA loans to third parties. In the event of a loss resulting from default and a determination by the SBA that there is a compliance deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Corporation, the SBA may require the Corporation to repurchase the
loan, deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from the Corporation. The Corporation must comply with applicable SBA regulations in order to maintain the guaranty.
Management has assessed the estimated losses inherent in the outstanding guaranteed portions of SBA loans sold in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, and determined a recourse reserve based on the probability of future losses for these loans to be $723,000 at December 31, 2020. The recourse reserve is reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the SBA recourse reserve.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect the Corporation’s financial position or results of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Discussed below are certain policies that are critical to the Corporation. We view critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents our recognition of the risks of extending credit and our evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio and as such, requires the use of judgment as well as other systematic objective and quantitative methods which may include additional assumptions and estimates. The risks of extending credit and the accuracy of our evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio are neither static nor mutually exclusive and could result in a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We may over-estimate the quality of the loan and lease portfolio, resulting in a lower allowance for loan and lease losses than necessary, overstating net income and equity. Conversely, we may under-estimate the quality of the loan and lease portfolio, resulting in a higher allowance for loan and lease losses than necessary, understating net income and equity. The allowance for loan and lease losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses, increased by the provision for loan and lease losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. We estimate the allowance reserve balance required and the related provision for loan and lease losses based on quarterly evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, with particular attention paid to loans and leases that have been specifically identified as needing additional management analysis because of the potential for further problems. During these evaluations, consideration is also given to such factors as the level and composition of impaired and other non-performing loans and leases, historical loss experience, results of examinations by regulatory agencies, independent loan and lease reviews, our estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral taking into consideration various valuation techniques and qualitative adjustments to inputs to those estimates of fair value, the strength and availability of guarantees, concentration of credits, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or leases, but the entire allowance is available for any loan or lease that, in our judgment, should be charged off. Loan and lease losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the uncollectability of a loan or lease balance is confirmed. See Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 - Loan and Lease Receivables, Impaired Loans and Leases and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the allowance for loan and lease losses.
We also continue to exercise our legal rights and remedies as appropriate in the collection and disposal of non-performing assets, and adhere to rigorous underwriting standards in our origination process in order to achieve strong asset quality. Although we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses was appropriate as of December 31, 2020 based upon the evaluation of loan and lease delinquencies, non-performing assets, charge-off trends, economic conditions, and other factors, there can be no assurance that future adjustments to the allowance will not be necessary. If the quality of loans or leases deteriorates, then the allowance for loan and lease losses would generally be expected to increase relative to total loans and leases. If loan or lease quality improves, then the allowance would generally be expected to decrease relative to total loans and leases.
Goodwill Impairment Assessment. Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. As part of the Corporation’s qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment, management considered the triggering event of the COVID-19 pandemic and determined that the significant change in the general economic environment and financial markets, including the Corporation’s market capitalization, represents an interim impairment indicator requiring continued evaluation. The Corporation performed Step 1,
quantitative goodwill impairment testing, as of August 1, 2020. Based on the analysis performed, management concluded the Corporation’s goodwill was not impaired as of August 1, 2020.
The Corporation conducted a subsequent impairment test as of December 31, 2020, utilizing a qualitative assessment, and concluded that it was more likely than not the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. Although no goodwill impairment was noted, there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairment will not occur. See Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the Corporation's accounting policy on goodwill and see Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the factors considered by management in the assessment.
Income Taxes. The Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined Wisconsin state tax return. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analysis of many factors, including the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, the difference between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), estimates of amounts currently due or owed, such as the timing of reversals of temporary differences, and current accounting standards. We apply a more likely than not approach to each of our tax positions when determining the amount of tax benefit to record in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
We have made our best estimate of valuation allowances utilizing available evidence and evaluation of sources of taxable income including tax planning strategies and expected reversals of timing differences to determine if valuation allowances were needed for deferred tax assets. Realization of deferred tax assets over time is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable earnings in future periods and a valuation allowance may be necessary if management determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred asset will not be utilized. These estimates and assumptions are subject to change. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could adversely affect future consolidated results of operations. The Corporation believes the tax assets and liabilities are properly recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Note 16 - Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Corporation also invests in certain development entities that generate federal and state historic tax credits. The tax benefits associated with these investments are accounted for under the flow-through method and are recognized when the respective project is placed in service.
The federal and state taxing authorities who make assessments based on their determination of tax laws may periodically review our interpretation of federal and state income tax laws. Tax liabilities could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities based on the completion of examinations by taxing authorities.
