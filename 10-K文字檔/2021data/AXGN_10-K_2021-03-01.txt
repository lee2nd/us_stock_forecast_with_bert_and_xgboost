Dollar amounts referenced in this Item 7 are in thousands, except per share amounts.
Overview
We are the leading company focused specifically on the science, development and commercialization of technologies for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. We are passionate about helping to restore peripheral nerve function and quality of life to patients with physical damage or transection to peripheral nerves providing innovative, clinically proven and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and health care providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve, or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves, can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.
Our platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products, including Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site, Axoguard® Nerve Connector, a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix (“ECM”) coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves, Axoguard® Nerve Protector, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect injured peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments, Axoguard® Nerve Cap, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma and Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane, a processed human umbilical cord intended for surgical use as a resorbable soft tissue barrier. Along with these core surgical products, we also offer the Axotouch® Two-Point Discriminator, used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin. Our product are available in the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea and several European and other international countries.
Revenue from the distribution of Axogen’s peripheral nerve repair products, Avance Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector, Axoguard Nerve Protector, Axoguard Nerve Cap and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, in the United States is the main contributor to Axogen’s total reported sales and has been the key component of its growth to date.
We have experienced that surgeons initially are cautious adopters for peripheral nerve repair products. Surgeons typically start with a few cases and then wait and see the results of these initial cases. Active accounts are usually past this wait period and have developed some level of product reorder. These active accounts have typically gone through the committee approval process, have at least one surgeon who has converted a portion of his or her treatment algorithms of peripheral nerve repair to the Axogen portfolio and have ordered Axogen products at least six times in the last twelve months. As such, revenue growth primarily occurs from increased purchasing from active accounts, followed by revenue growth from new accounts.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The global impact of COVID-19 has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and significantly impacting the medical industry. In response to COVID-19, our top priority has been the health and safety of those we serve, including healthcare professionals and their patients, as well as our employees, communities, and suppliers. We ensured employee compliance with state and local mandates as well as implemented certain cost mitigation initiatives such as a reduction in pay levels, temporary suspension of tissue processing and deferral of certain projects, among other efforts.
As we began to experience some recovery from COVID-19, some of our cost mitigation initiatives were lifted such as the restoration of pay levels, which were lifted for most employees in August 2020, and for executive member and board members in late October. We began to gradually restart tissue processing in June and have continued to increase capacity through the end of the fiscal year. We have also begun to slowly increase investment into projects that were previously on hold, including certain clinical trials, product development, and marketing and administrative initiatives, as well as restarting construction of the biologics processing center in Vandelia, Ohio.
Although COVID-19 had significant impact on our revenue growth, the Company was able to increase revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019. Late last year, we rebalanced our commercial organization toward our largest market opportunity, extremity trauma, and refocused our team on driving deeper penetration with our existing surgeon customers. During COVID-19 pandemic, we kept our sales team and broader commercial organization intact and took the opportunity to provide extensive sales training. Our sales team developed skills and shared best practices around remote case support where hospital access has
been restricted. We believe this remote support has been appreciated by customers and has expanded our sales team’s ability to support surgeons and their patients during COVID-19 and beyond.
In addition, our professional education group was able to quickly develop a virtual surgeon training program, and combined with our marketing initiatives, was successful in developing new customers and revenue growth through product penetration.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and as percentages of total revenue:
Revenue
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 5.2% to $112,300 as compared to $106,712 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the on-set of COVID-19, certain hospitals and surgery centers discontinued elective surgeries and our sales force was not allowed to enter the hospitals. This significantly reduced our revenue. Once elective surgeries resumed, hospitals allowed our sales representatives to begin entering their facilities once again. As a result, we began to experience a return in revenue as these facilities began scheduling surgeries, although restrictions continue to limit our access in certain accounts as local communities address resurgences of COVID-19. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in unit volume of approximately 2%, as well as the net impact of changes in prices and product mix of approximately 3%. The growth in unit volume increase was primarily attributed to unit growth in our active accounts. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had 893 active accounts, an increase of 12% from 797 at the end of 2019.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 1.5% to $90,719 as compared to $89,363 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit increased during fiscal 2020 due to an increase in revenue, offset by the impact of COVID-19. Gross profit margin in 2020 decreased to 80.8% as compared to 83.7% in 2019. Gross margin was negatively impacted during fiscal year 2020 due to idle facility charges and other increased period costs of approximately $2,000 in the second and third quarters resulting from our temporary suspension of tissue processing, as well as approximately $2,242 of inventory write-downs. Gross margins have continued to improve sequentially in the second half of the year and we expect them to continue to return to historical levels as revenue and nerve processing volumes increase.
Costs and Expenses
Total cost and expenses decreased 5.7% to $113,901 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $120,769 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the impact of our lower travel and in-person surgeon education program of $9,807 as a result of restrictions associated with COVID-19, as well as a decreased litigation expenses of $2,467 as a result of reaching deductible limits with respect to certain litigation matters. These decreases were slightly offset by higher sales commissions and other compensation related costs of $5,519. As a percentage of revenue, total cost and expenses decreased to 101.4% in 2020 compared to 113.1% in 2019.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased 3.2% to $69,659 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $71,950 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was driven by lower travel, surgeon education and conference expenses as we cancelled in-person education programs, and experienced restrictions in hospital access and travel directly related to the impact of COVID-19. The decrease in expenses was slightly offset by salaries and benefits from increased sales commissions. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 62.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 67.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect sales and marketing expenses will increase as pandemic-related restrictions in hospital access and travel normalize.
General and administrative expenses decreased 15.7% to $26,396 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $31,305 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower litigation expenses as a result of reaching deductible limits with respect to certain litigation matters as well as a decrease in stock compensation. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 23.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Research and development expenses slightly increased to $17,846 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $17,514 in the prior year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development costs include our product development efforts as well as non-clinical spend in support of our BLA for Avance Nerve Graft, and clinical trials. Product development expenses represented approximately 50% of total research and development expense in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 52% in the prior year period. It is expected that costs associated with the BLA will continue to increase as we continue to invest in completing the license application. Additionally, we continue to conduct development efforts focused on both new peripheral nerve products and new peripheral nerve applications for our existing products. We pursue research grants to support research and early product development. Clinical trial expenses represented approximately 50% of research and development expense in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 48% in the prior year period. COVID-19 negatively impacted certain of our clinical study programs as certain study sites restricted access and reallocated their resources to focused on COVID-19 related care; however, we expect activity to recover over the next fiscal year. Included within Clinical trial expenses are clinical trial costs associated with the BLA. Our continued efforts related to the BLA drove the slight increase in research and development expenses year over year. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 15.9% in 2019 from 16.4% in 2019.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest expense increased to $1,054 as compared to $40 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is primarily due to interest expense from our Oberland debt facility, which began on June 30, 2020. We recognized total interest charges of $1,941 in connection with the Oberland debt facility in the current year, but $997 of this interest was capitalized to the construction costs of the APC. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $605 of investment income from our asset management and cash investment sweep accounts as compared to $2,364 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to lower investment income from our asset management program as a result of lower interest rates from COVID-19 and as we lowered investment balances and increased cash reserves.
Income Taxes
We had no income tax expenses or income tax benefit for 2020 or 2019 due to incurrence of net operating loss for the year, the benefits of which have been fully value allowed. We do not believe that there are any additional tax expenses or benefits currently available.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts and as percentages of total revenue:
Revenue
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 27.1% to $106,712 as compared to $83,937 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue growth for the year was primarily the result of increases in unit volume, as well as the net impact of price increases and changes in product mix. Our revenue growth was largely driven by increased revenue in active accounts as well as the addition of new active accounts. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we had 797 active accounts, an increase of 12% from 712 at the end of 2018.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 25.8% to $89,363 as compared to $71,014 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased revenue, but slightly offset by increased processing costs, inventory write downs and additional inventory reserves. Gross profit margin in 2019 decreased to 83.7% as compared to 84.6% in 2018.
Costs and Expenses
Total cost and expenses increased 32.0% to $120,769 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $91,514 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to variable costs associated with increased sales activity, expansion of our commercial team, expanding product development and clinical study activities, expanded surgeon education programs, and increases in compensation and general expenses associated with ongoing expansions of infrastructure to support
our growth. In addition, general and administrative expenses include approximately $2,467 of litigation expenses and certain expenses associated therewith, as a result of the ongoing litigation described in Legal Proceedings and other litigation that was dismissed during 2019 (the “Litigation”) in the period ending December 31, 2019 as compared to $0 in the prior year period. As a percentage of revenue, total cost and expenses increased to 113.1% in 2019 compared to 109.0% in 2018.
Sales and marketing expenses increased 27.1% to $71,950 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $56,617 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to: (a) increased compensation expenses related to Axogen’s direct sales force as a result of increased sales and hiring of additional personnel; (b) increased travel expenses to support the commercial team’s activities; (c) expansion of our surgeon education program; and (d) increased marketing activity. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 67.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 67.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
General and administrative expenses increased 35.4% to $31,305 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $23,124 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased expenses related to infrastructure expansion to support our growth, including professional fees, salaries, and an increase of $1,982 of non-cash stock compensation. As mentioned above, we also recorded $2,467 of legal fees associated the Litigation. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Research and development expenses increased 48.8% to $17,514 in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $11,773 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Research and development costs include our product development and clinical efforts substantially focused on its Biologics License Application, or BLA, for Avance Nerve Graft, the Sensation-NOW and RECON studies and the development of new or next generation products. The increase in expenses for 2019 relate to expenditures for these activities and hiring additional personnel to support clinical and product development activity. It is expected that costs associated with the BLA will continue to increase as we continue to invest in completing the license application. We continue to conduct development efforts focused on both new peripheral nerve products and new peripheral nerve applications for our existing products. We pursue research grants to support research and early product development. Our increased product and clinical pipeline development initiatives contributed to the increase in research and development expenses in 2019. As a result, research and development expenses increased to 16.4% in 2019 from 14.0% in 2018, as a percentage of revenue.
Other Income and Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2,364 of investment income from our asset management and cash investment sweep accounts as compared to $1,525 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense decreased to $40 as compared to $1,127 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of our paying, in full, the Term Loan and Revolving Loan with MidCap, as defined in “Term and Revolving Loan Agreements in the prior year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of the debt of $2,186 for exit, prepayment fees and the amortization of the remaining balance of the deferred financing costs for which there was no such activity in the current year.
Income Taxes
We had no income tax expenses or income tax benefit for 2019 or 2018 due to incurrence of net operating loss for the year, the benefits of which have been fully value allowed.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Information
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash of $110,808, an increase of $8,298 from $102,510 at December 31, 2019. The increase includes $35,000 of proceeds from our new debt facility, $3,500 of equity proceeds from the Oberland Option, and $2,630 of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises, partially offset by $21,905 of capital expenditures, and $9,626 of cash used in operating activities including favorable changes in working capital.
We have working capital of $122,420 and a current ratio of 6.4 at December 31, 2020, compared to working capital of $114,141 and a current ratio of 6.5 at December 31, 2019. The increase in working capital at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, was primarily proceeds from our new debt facility, which is recorded as a long-term liability and the year over year improvement in the cash collections cycle, as accounts receivable remained relatively flat with revenue growth of 5.2%.
Our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors including, without limitation, revenue increases consistent with our business plan, cost of products and acquisition and/or development of new products. We could face increasing capital needs. Such capital needs could be substantial depending on the extent to which we are unable to increase revenue.
If we need additional capital in the future, we may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our shareholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The increasing need for capital could also make it more difficult to obtain funding through either equity or debt. Should additional capital not become available to us as needed, we may be required to take certain action, such as slowing sales and marketing expansion, delaying regulatory approvals or reducing headcount.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
We used $9,626 of cash for operating activities in 2020, as compared to using $19,872 and $17,862 of cash for operating activities in 2019 and 2018, respectively. This improvement in cash used in operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital as well as a decrease in the net loss year over year. Net cash used in operations decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 was the result of a higher net loss for the year offset by improvements in working capital.
Net Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities
Investing activities for 2020 used $16,963 of cash as compared to providing $27,271 during 2019 and use of $98,193 in 2018. The increase in outflows of cash in the current year as compared to 2019 primarily related to capital expenditures for APC and our Tampa facilities offset by higher proceeds from the sale of investments in prior year. The improvement in cash flow from investing in 2019 over 2018, was primarily the result of the Company beginning to invest in longer term instruments in 2018.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Financing activities in 2020 provided $40,474 of cash as compared to providing $4,031 and $109,842 of cash in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2020 improvement over 2019 was primarily the result of the borrowings from the Oberland Facility of $35,000 as well as $3,500 of proceeds from the exercise of the stock options related to the Oberland Facility, see Footnote 10 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The decrease of cash flows in
2019 as compared to 2018 was the result of the equity financing of $132,964 in 2018. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options, excluding the Oberland stock option exercise, provided $3,300, $4,002, and $3,884 of cash for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Operating Cash Requirements
On July 9, 2019, we entered into a Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Design-Builder (the “Design-Build Agreement”) with CRB Builders, L.L.C., a Missouri limited liability company (“CRB”), pursuant to which CRB will renovate and retrofit the APC (See Footnote 15 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We anticipate spending up to approximately $25,002 for renovations, equipment and furniture over the next twelve months and up to $26,821 over the next 18 months.
As previously disclosed, we entered into an agreement with Heights Union, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Heights Union”), for the lease of seventy-five thousand square feet of office and lab space. Pursuant to the Heights Union lease, we will use the Heights Union Premises for general office, medical laboratory, training and meeting purposes. We expect to spend $1,573 in the first quarter as we complete our furnishing and final touches on our new facility.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash totaling $110,808 and total current liabilities of $22,831. Based on current estimates, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will allow us to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months.
Credit Facilities
On October 25, 2016, we entered into Term Loan and a Revolving Loan with MidCap Financial Trust (“MidCap”) maturing on May 1, 2021.
We have the option at any time to prepay the Term Loan in whole or in part, subject to payment of a prepayment fee and an exit fee. On May 22, 2018, we exercised our option and paid $22,599 to prepay the Term Loan in full, which included exit and pre-payment fees totaling $1,470. In addition, on May 22, 2018, we charged to interest expense the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan of $473.
We also had the option to terminate or permanently reduce the Revolving Loan prior to the maturity date subject to its payment of a deferred origination fee. On May 22, 2018, we exercised its option to terminate and paid $2,958 to prepay the Revolving Loan in full, which amount included fees of $236.
On June 30, 2020, we entered into a seven-year financing agreement with Oberland Capital (the “Oberland Facility”) and obtained the first tranche of $35,000 at closing. The Oberland Facility provides for a total of $75,000 through two additional tranches that can be drawn by December 31, 2021 and requires interest-only payments for the duration of the term. A second tranche of $15,000 may be drawn at our option upon achieving two consecutive quarters with revenue of at least $20,000. Such second tranche may also be put to us at any time by Oberland Capital. A third tranche of $25,000 may be drawn at our option upon achieving two consecutive quarters with revenue of $28,000. The financing costs for this facility are approximately $642 and was recorded as a contra liability to the debt facility.
The Oberland Facility requires quarterly interest payments for seven years. Interest is calculated as 7.5% plus the greater of LIBOR or 2.0% (9.5% as of December 31, 2020). Each tranche of the Oberland Facility, if and when issued, will have a term of seven years from the date of issuance (with the first tranche issued on June 30, 2020 maturing on June 30, 2027). In connection with the Oberland Facility, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with Oberland Capital, which provides that, among other things, an additional quarterly royalty payment as a percentage of our net revenue, up to $70,000 in any given fiscal year, subject to certain limitations set forth therein, during the period commencing on the later of (i) April 1, 2021 and (ii) the date of funding of a tranche of the loan, and ending on the date upon which all amounts owed under the Oberland Facility have been paid in full (the “Revenue Participation Agreement”). Payments will commence on September 30, 2021. This royalty structure results in approximately 1.0% per year of additional interest payments on the outstanding loan amount.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our obligations with regard to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, and the expected timing of maturities of these contractual obligations. This table should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Service Agreements disclosed in Footnote 15 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements do not have annual firm commitments.
APC Commitment
On July 9, 2019, we entered into the Design-Build Agreement with CRB (which was subsequently amended on October 6, 2020), pursuant to which CRB will renovate and retrofit the APC. The Design-Build Agreement contains several design phase milestones that began in July 2019 and sets the date for Substantial Completion (as defined in the Design-Build Agreement) in the third quarter of 2021, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Design-Build Agreement. The estimated cost pursuant to the Design-Build Agreement is $28,846. Additional costs associated with the renovation, purchasing of furniture and equipment, validation and certification of the APC are estimated to be $13,600. These capital expenditure costs will be incurred as they arise until the anticipated full transition of material processing to the APC by late 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded $9,645 in the current year and $15,671 to date related to renovations and design build in construction in progress. These items are recorded as projects in process as part of the property and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we will capitalize interest expense from its debt facility based on the amount of accumulated expenditures of this asset during the period that is required to get the asset ready for its intended use. During fiscal 2020, we capitalized interest of $489 to construction in progress.
As a result of COVID-19, we implemented a cost reduction strategy designed to defer and reduce certain expenses, including deferment of the APC by up to one year. This deferral had the potential to defer approximately $25,000 of expected 2020 capital expenditures to 2021. In addition, the Company extended its current production facility License and Services agreement with Community Tissue Services (“CTS”) by one year to December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined to resume the APC project. We expect expenditures of approximately $26,000 during 2021.
We expect to receive certain economic development grants from state and local authorities totaling up to approximately $2,685 including $1,250 of cash grants to offset costs to acquire and develop the property. These grants have claw back clauses if the Company does not meet these job creation milestones by 2023. We believe despite the delay in the APC that these incentives will continue to be available.
Subsequent Events
On February 22, 2021, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Licenses and Services Agreement with Community Tissue Services (the "CTS Agreement"). The amendment extends the term of the agreement until December 31, 2023.
Tampa Commitment
Pursuant to the Heights Agreement, we will use the leased premises in Tampa, Florida for general office, medical laboratory, training and meeting purposes. The lease term includes several months of free rent. We recorded a right of use asset and liability at the commencement of the lease term as discussed in Footnote 15 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We began occupying the premises in September of 2020.
Public Offering of Common Stock
On November 16, 2017, Axogen entered into a certain underwriting agreement (the “Leerink Underwriting Agreement”) with Leerink Partners LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the “2017 Offering Underwriters”) and Essex, pursuant to which (i) we agreed to issue and sell 700,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-207829), filed with the SEC on November 5, 2015, and declared effective by the SEC on December 11, 2015, and the prospectus contained therein, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated November 16, 2017, and (ii) Essex agreed to sell 1,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-220770), filed with the SEC on October 2, 2017, and declared effective by the SEC on October 11, 2017, and the prospectus contained therein, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in an underwritten registered public offering at an offering price of $21.00 per share. We, together with Essex, granted the 2017 Offering Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 255,000 additional shares of common stock, at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, which was exercised in full on November 16, 2017. We received net proceeds of approximately $15,655 after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.
On May 8, 2018, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC and Leerink Partners LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the “2018 Offering Underwriters”), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell 3,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten registered public offering at an offering price of $41.00 per share (the “2018 Offering”). We granted the 2018 Offering Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 450,000 additional shares of common stock, at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, which was exercised in full on May 9, 2018. The 2018 Offering closed on May 11, 2018, and we received proceeds of approximately $132,707 from the sale of the shares (including the sale of 450,000 additional shares issued upon exercise of the 2018 Offering Underwriters’ overallotment option), after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Effect of Inflation
Inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations, and we do not expect it to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition in the foreseeable future.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amount of expenses during the period reported. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have described our significant accounting policies in Footnote 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
We enter into contracts to sell and distribute products and services to hospitals and surgical facilities for use in caring for patients with peripheral nerve damage or transection. Revenue is recognized when we have met its performance obligations pursuant to its contracts with its customers in an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the transfer of control of the products and services to our customers.
In the case of products or services sold to a customer under a distribution or purchase agreement, the distributors are granted exclusive distribution rights to sell the implants internationally in a territory defined by the contract. These international distributor agreements contain provisions that allow us to terminate the distribution agreement with the distributor, and upon termination, the right to repurchase inventory from the distributor at the distributor’s cost. We have determined that its
contractual rights to repurchase distributor inventory upon termination of the distributor agreement are not substantive and do not impact the timing of when control transfers; and, therefore, we have determined it is appropriate to recognize revenue when: i) the product is shipped via common carrier; or ii) the product is delivered to the customer or distributor, depending on the terms of the agreement. Determining the timing of revenue recognition for such contracts is subject to judgment, because an evaluation must be made regarding the distributor’s ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the implants received from us. Changes in these assessments could have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition from sales to distributors.
A portion of our product revenue is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals and independent sales agencies, and also from inventory physically held by field sales representatives. For these types of products sales, we retain control until the product has been used or implanted, at which time revenue is recognized.
We elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than a separate performance obligation. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included as part of the transaction price and recognized as revenue when control of the underlying products is transferred to the customer. The related shipping and freight charges incurred by us are included in cost of sales.
We operate in a single reportable segment of peripheral nerve repair, offers similar products to its customers, and enters into consistently structured arrangements with similar types of customers. As such,we do not disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers as the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows does not materially differ within and among the contracts with customers.
The contract with the customer states the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each implant distributed. The payment terms and conditions in our contracts vary; however, as a common business practice, payment terms are typically due in full within 30 to 60 days of delivery. Since the customer agrees to a stated price in the contract that does not vary over the contract term, the contracts do not contain any material types of variable consideration, and contractual rights of return are not material. We have several contracts with distributors in international markets which include consideration paid to the customer in exchange for distinct marketing and other services. We record such consideration paid to the customer as a reduction to revenue from the contracts with those distributor customers.
Inventory - Valuation Associated with Excess and Obsolete Inventory
Inventory is comprised of unprocessed tissue, work-in-process, Avance Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector, Axoguard Nerve Protector, Axoguard Nerve Cap, Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator and supplies and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value.
We monitor the shelf life of our products and historical expiration and spoilage trends, and writes-off inventory based on the estimated amount of inventory that will not be distributed before expiration or spoilage. To estimate the amount of inventory that will expire prior to being sold, we review inventory quantities on hand, historical and projected sales, and historical expiration trends. Our calculation of the amount of inventory that will expire prior to sale has two components: 1) a demand or consumption based component that compares projected sales to inventory quantities on hand; and 2) an expiring inventory component that assesses the risk related to inventory that is near expiration by analyzing historical expiration trends to project inventory that will expire prior to being sold. Our model assumes that inventory will be sold on a first-in-first-out basis. Due to the nature of the inventory (surgical implants with expiration dates) and the fact that a significant portion of our inventory is at medical facility consignment locations, estimating the amount of inventory that will expire and the amount of inventory that should be written-down involves significant judgments and estimates.
Share-Based Compensation
We account for share-based compensation for all share-based payment awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock purchases related to an employee stock purchase plan, based on their estimated fair values. We estimate the fair value of time-based options on the date of grant using the multi-point Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model). Our determination of fair value of share-based payment awards is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. The value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards based upon the grant date closing market price of our common stock.
We also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), which is available to all eligible employees as defined by the plan document. Under the ESPP, shares of our common stock may be purchased at a discount, currently fifteen percent (15%). We estimate the number of shares to be purchased under the ESPP at the beginning of the purchase period and calculate estimated compensation expense using the Black-Scholes model based upon the fair value of the stock at the beginning of the purchase period. Compensation expense is recognized over each purchase period, and expense is adjusted at the time of stock purchase.
We believe our critical accounting policies regarding revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, investments, inventory and share-based employee compensation affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We base our judgments and estimates on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors.
