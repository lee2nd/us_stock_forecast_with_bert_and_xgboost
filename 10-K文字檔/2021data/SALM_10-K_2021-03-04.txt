Overview
Salem Media Group, Inc. (“Salem” “we” “us” “our” and “its”) is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and
conservative news talk. We maintain a website at www.salemmedia.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary.
We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments.
Our principal sources of broadcast revenue include:
•
the sale of block program time to national and local program producers;
•
the sale of advertising time on our radio stations to national and local advertisers;
•
the sale of banner advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications;
•
the sale of digital streaming advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications;
•
the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters;
•
fees earned for the creation of custom web pages and custom digital media campaigns for our advertisers through Salem Surround;
•
the sale of advertising time on our national network;
•
the syndication of programming on our national network;
•
product sales and royalties for on-air host materials, including podcasts and programs; and
•
other revenue such as events, including ticket sales and sponsorships, listener purchase programs, where revenue is generated from special discounts and incentives offered to our listeners from our advertisers; talent fees for voice-overs or custom endorsements from our on-air personalities and production services, and lease income for studios, towers or office space.
Our principal sources of digital media revenue include:
•
the sale of digital banner advertisements on our websites and mobile applications;
•
the sale of digital streaming advertisements on websites and mobile applications;
•
the support and promotion to stream third-party content on our websites;
•
the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters;
•
the digital delivery of newsletters to subscribers; and
•
the number of video and graphic downloads.
Our principal sources of publishing revenue include:
•
the sale of books and e-books;
•
publishing fees from authors;
•
the sale of digital advertising on our magazine websites and digital newsletters;
•
subscription fees for our print magazine; and
•
the sale of print magazine advertising.
In each of our operating segments, the rates we can charge for airtime, advertising and other products and services are dependent upon several factors, including:
•
audience share;
•
how well our programs and advertisements perform for our clients;
•
the size of the market and audience reached;
•
the number of impressions delivered;
•
the number of advertisements and programs streamed;
•
the number of page views achieved;
•
the number of downloads completed;
•
the number of events held, the number of event sponsorships sold and the attendance at each event;

supply and demand for airtime on a local and national level.
Broadcasting
Our foundational business is radio broadcasting, which includes the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets, our national networks and our national sales firms including Salem Surround. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of our broadcasting operations.
Revenue generated from our radio stations, networks and sales firms is reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.
Broadcast revenue is impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers and advertisers, the number of impressions delivered or downloads made, and the number of events held, including the size of the event and the number of attendees. Block programming rates are based upon our stations’ ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products. Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks’ ability to produce results for their advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. In select markets, we subscribe to Nielsen Audio, which develops monthly reports measuring a radio station’s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre-determined level of time available for block programming and/or advertising, which may vary at different times of the day.
Nielsen Audio uses the Portable People Meter TM (“PPM”) technology to collect data for its ratings service. PPM is a small device that is capable of automatically measuring radio, television, Internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals encoded by the broadcaster. The PPM offers a number of advantages over traditional diary ratings collection systems, including ease of use, more reliable ratings data, shorter time periods between when
advertising runs and actual listening data, and little manipulation of data by users. A disadvantage of the PPM includes data fluctuations from changes to the “panel” (a group of individuals holding PPM devices). This makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of listeners at any given time. We subscribe to Nielsen Audio for ratings services in 7 of our broadcast markets.
Our results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly fluctuations in the retail industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for political advertising during election, or even numbered years, over non-election or odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues.
Our cash flows from broadcasting are affected by transitional periods experienced by radio stations when, based on the nature of the radio station, our plans for the market and other circumstances, we find it beneficial to change the station format. During this transitional period, when we develop a radio station’s listener and customer base, the station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow.
In broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 98% and 97%, respectively, of our broadcast revenue was sold for cash.
Broadcast operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities.
Digital Media
Our digital media based businesses provide Christian, conservative, investing, e-commerce, audio and video streaming, and other resources digitally through the web. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our digital media websites and operations.
Revenue generated from this segment is reported as digital media revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report. Digital media revenue is impacted by the rates our sites can charge for advertising time, the level of advertisements sold, the number of impressions delivered or the number of products sold and the number of digital subscriptions sold. Like our broadcasting segment, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which Easter is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product websites. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising time and placement during election years for political advertisements.
The primary operating expenses incurred by our digital media businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) royalties, (v) streaming costs, and (vi) cost of goods sold associated with e-commerce sites.
Publishing
Our publishing operations include book publishing through Regnery® Publishing, self-publishing services through Salem Author Services and Singing News Magazine. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our publishing operations.
Revenue generated from this segment is reported as publishing revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report. Publishing revenue is impacted by the retail price of books and e-books, the number of books sold, the number and retail price of e-books sold, the number and rate of print magazine subscriptions sold, the rate and number of pages of advertisements sold in each print magazine, and the number and rate at which self-published books are published. Regnery® Publishing revenue is impacted by elections as it generates higher levels of interest and demand for publications containing conservative and political based opinions.
The primary operating expenses incurred by our publishing businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; and (iv) cost of goods sold that includes printing and production costs, fulfillment costs, author royalties and inventory reserves.
Known Trends and Uncertainties
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include stay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely affected workforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising spend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives substantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events.
While this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to improve from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing uncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19’s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and private entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions from COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior.
Future availability under our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at December 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019.
The growth of broadcast revenue associated with the sale of airtime remains challenged. We believe this is due to increased competition from other forms of content distribution and the length of time spent listening to audio streaming services, podcasts and satellite radio. Increases in competition and the mix in listening time may lead advertisers to conclude that the effectiveness of radio has diminished. To minimize the impact of these factors, we continue to enhance our digital assets to complement our broadcast content. The increase use of voice activated platforms, or smart speakers, that provide audiences with the ability to access AM and FM radio stations show increased potential for broadcasters to reach audiences.
Our broadcast revenue is particularly dependent on advertising from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 10.6% and 9.3% respectively, of our total net broadcast revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 11.6% and 10.1%, respectively, of our total net broadcast revenue during the same period of the prior year.
Revenue from print magazines, including advertising revenue and subscription revenue, is challenged due to lower demand from the audiences that increasingly use other mediums that deliver comparable information. Book sales are contingent upon overall economic conditions and our ability to attract and retain authors. Decreases in digital revenue could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and results of operations. Digital revenue is impacted by the nature and delivery of page views and the number of advertisements per page. We have experienced a shift in the number of page views from desktop devices to mobile devices. While mobile page views have increased dramatically, they carry a lower number of advertisements per page and are generally sold at lower rates. A shift from desktop page views to mobile device views negatively impacts revenue as mobile devices carry lower rates and less advertisement per page. To minimize the impact that any one of these areas could have, we continue to explore opportunities to cross-promote our brands and our content, and to strategically monitor costs.
Key Financial Performance Indicators-Same-Station Definition
In the discussion of our results of operations below, we compare our broadcast operating results between periods on an as-reported basis, which includes the operating results of all radio stations and networks owned or operated at any time during either period and on a Same Station basis. Same Station is a Non-GAAP financial measure used both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community as well as in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Refer to “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for definitions and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial results, develop budgets, manage expenditures and as a measure of performance under compensation programs.
Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable financial measures as reported in accordance with GAAP.
Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K defines and prescribes the conditions under which certain non-GAAP financial information may be presented in this annual report. We closely monitor EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Station Operating Income (“SOI”), Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses,
Same Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results, and thus, are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results, trends and performance.
The performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate SOI. We define SOI as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses, as explained above, have a direct impact on changes in SOI. SOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. SOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. We believe that SOI is a useful non-GAAP financial measure to investors when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to SOI), because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media, entertainment and communications industries. SOI is commonly used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups. We use SOI as one of the key measures of operating efficiency and profitability, including our internal reviews for potential impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. SOI does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of SOI is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station-results for each of the four quarters of that year. We use Same Station Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses and Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We apply a similar methodology to our digital media and publishing group. Digital Media Operating Income is defined as net digital media revenue less digital media operating expenses. Publishing Operating Loss is defined as net publishing revenue less publishing operating expenses. Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial performance measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to our operating results reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are useful non-GAAP financial measures to investors, when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure), because they are comparable to those used to measure performance of our broadcasting entities. We use this analysis as one of the key measures of operating efficiency, profitability and in our internal reviews for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. This measurement does not purport to represent cash
provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Loss are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before gains or losses on the disposition of assets, before changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, before gains on bargain purchases, before the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, before impairments, before net miscellaneous income and expenses, before loss on early retirement of debt, before (gain) loss from discontinued operations and before non-cash compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by the broadcast and media industry as important measures of performance and are used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide meaningful comparisons between broadcasters. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to our results of operations and financial condition presented in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
For all non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with these metrics, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
In the tables below, we present a reconciliation of net broadcast revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Same Station net broadcast revenue, and broadcast operating expenses, the most comparable GAAP measure to Same Station broadcast operating expense. We show our calculation of SOI and Same Station Operating Income, which is reconciled from net income, the most comparable GAAP measure in the table following our calculation of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Loss. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.
In the table below, we present our calculations of Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income. Our presentation of these non-GAAP performance indicators are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.

Net Broadcast Revenue
The following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of net broadcast revenue for each broadcast revenue source.
Block programming revenue declined by $7.7 million, including a $6.2 million decline in local programming revenue and a $1.5 million decline in national programming revenue. The decline includes $2.7 million of revenue generated in 2019 from stations sold during that year, of which $2.3 million was local programming and $0.4 million was national programming. Additionally, approximately $1.2 million of the decline was due to local sports programming that was cancelled during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and $0.4 million from early payments discounts offered to a limited number of national programmers during 2020. The remainder of the decline was due to certain programmers discontinuing their ministry efforts and an increase in competition from other broadcasters and from podcasts that resulted in a lower number of programs and lower rates.
Advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, declined by $13.5 million, $15.9 million net of political, due to a $13.3 million decline in local advertising net of political and a $2.6 million decline in national advertising revenue net of political. Local advertising, net of political, declined by $5.6 million on our Contemporary Christian Music format radio stations, $3.0 million on our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations, $2.4 million on our News Talk format radio stations, and $2.1 million on other format stations. These declines were due to lower spot rates charged to compete with other broadcasters, primarily in the Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets, where competition for advertising buys was strong. An additional $1.4 million of the decline resulted from stations sold during 2019. The remainder of the decline was attributable to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with many advertisers reducing or ceasing to advertise due to stay-at-home orders and limited capacity orders that temporarily closed their businesses.
Station digital revenue, or local digital revenue generated from our radio stations and networks, increased by $9.6 million due to the growth of digital product offerings through Salem Surround, our national multimedia digital advertising agency providing digital marketing services to our customers. Our product offerings include social media campaigns, search engine optimization, retargeted advertising and other services intended to increase our market share as advertising dollars shift away from pure broadcast to include digital and digital technologies. In addition, we recently launched SalemNOW, an on-demand pay-per-view video steaming platform that contributed $4.4 million of the $9.6 million growth in revenue. There were no significant changes in digital rates as compared to the prior year.
Declines in infomercial revenue were due to a reduction in the number of infomercials aired with no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year. The placement of infomercials can vary significantly from one period to another due to the number of time slots available and the degree to which the infomercial content is considered to be of interest to our audience.
Network revenue, net of digital, increased by $0.3 million due to a $1.7 million decline in national advertising revenue offset by a $2.0 million increase in political advertising.
Other revenue declined by $3.5 million due to a $2.7 million decrease in event revenue from the cancellation of live events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a $0.7 million decrease in listener purchase program revenue from lower listener participation. Event revenue varies from period to period based on the nature and timing of events, audience demand, and in some cases, the weather, which can affect attendance. We began offering virtual events during 2020 that may continue as conditions warrant.
On a Same Station basis, net broadcast revenue decreased $11.0 million, which reflects these items net of the impact of stations acquired, disposed of, or with format changes.
Net Digital Media Revenue
The following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of national net digital media revenue, or revenue generated from our websites and digital subscriptions, for each digital media revenue source.
National digital advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, increased by $0.2 million including a $1.4 million increase from conservative opinion websites within Townhall Media and a $0.1 million increase from Eagle Financial Publications that was offset with a $1.3 million decline from SWN. The net increase from Townhall Media includes $0.6 million from our March 2019 acquisition of pjmedia.com and increases from political elections and national events. Declines in national digital advertising from SWN are attributable to a loss of advertisers who moved advertising spending to digital programmatic advertisers, such as Facebook and Google, and to a loss of advertisers who reduced or eliminated advertising. We continue to acquire, develop and promote the use of mobile applications, particularly for our Christian mobile applications, to reduce our dependency on page views from digital programmatic advertisers. Because mobile page views carry fewer advertisements and tend to have shorter site visits as compared to desktop, our growth in mobile page views exceeds our growth in revenue from the mobile applications.
Digital streaming revenue decreased $0.4 million based on lower demand for content available from our Christian websites. There were no significant changes in sales volume or rates as compared to the prior year.
Digital subscription revenue increased $1.2 million, including a $1.0 million increase from Townhall VIP, a new subscription service from Townhall Media, $0.2 million from InvesmentHouse.com that was acquired in June 2019, and a $0.2 million net increase in the number of subscribers to newsletters from Eagle Financial Publications, offset by a $0.2 million decrease from Christianjobs.com and Churchstaffing.com within SWN.
Digital download revenue increased by $0.2 million from our church product websites, WorshipHouseMedia.com and SermonSpiceTM.com. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year.
E-commerce revenue decreased by $0.3 million including a $0.4 million decrease from the sale of Newport Natural Health on March 21, 2019 that was offset with a $0.1 million increase from Eagle Financial Publications. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year.
Other revenue includes revenue sharing arrangements for mobile applications and mail list rentals. We recognized revenue of $0.2 million in 2019 related to transfer services provided to the buyer of Newport Natural Health. There were no changes in volume or rates as compared to the prior year.
Net Publishing Revenue
The following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of net publishing revenue for each publishing revenue source.
Net book sales declined by $2.5 million due to a lower volume of sales from Regnery® Publishing and Salem Author Services. Regnery® Publishing book sales reflect an 2% decrease in the average price per unit sold and a 22% decrease in volume due to a majority of book stores in the country being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Amazon’s decision to prioritize the shipment of essential products over the shipment of books. Revenue from book sales through Regnery® Publishing are directly attributable to the number of titles released each period and the composite mix of titles available. Revenue varies significantly from period to period based on the book release date and the number of titles that achieve placement on bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book. The decrease of $1.3 million to the estimated sales returns and allowances reflects the lower number of print books sold through Regnery® Publishing. The decline in book sales from Salem Author Services was due to authors choosing not to buy books because they could not be promoted at live events. There were no significant changes in sale prices as compared to the prior year.
Regnery® Publishing e-book sales increased by $0.2 million with a 12% decrease in sales volume offset by a 27% increase in the average price per unit sold from sales incentives. E-book sales can also vary based on the composite mix of titles released and available in each period. Revenue varies significantly based on the book release date and the number of titles that achieve placement on bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book.
Self-publishing fees decreased $0.4 million due a decline in the number of authors with rates charged that were comparable to the prior year.
Declines in print magazine subscription revenue and advertising revenue reflect lower consumer demand and distribution levels. There were no significant changes in rates over the prior year.
Digital adverting revenue from Regnery® Publishing websites was consistent with the prior year with no changes in volume or rates.
Other revenue includes change fees, video trailers, and subright revenue for foreign translation and audio books for original published titles from Regnery® Publishing. Subright revenue declined $0.2 million due to lower demand.
Broadcast Operating Expenses
Broadcast operating expenses decreased by $8.5 million including $11.0 million from cost reduction initiatives and $5.1 million from stations sold during 2019 that were offset by a $7.5 million increase in costs from Salem Surround and SalemNOW. We implemented several cost cutting measures in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a $3.4 million reduction in employee-related costs from temporary pay cuts, layoffs and furloughs, a $2.2 million decline in event costs, a $2.0 million decline in advertising, a $1.1 million decline in travel and entertainment, and a $0.3 million decline in lease expense. The decrease also reflects a $3.4 million decline in commissions consistent with lower revenue, a $0.4 million decline in non-cash stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock awards, and a $0.3 million decline in music license fees that was partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in bad debt expense, including an additional reserve of $1.1 million recorded at March 31, 2020 due to the impact on collections of the economic uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic, a $0.5 million increase in legal fees and a $0.5 million increase in insurance and software maintenance fees.
On a same-station basis, broadcast operating expenses decreased by $3.4 million. The decrease in broadcast operating expenses on a Same Station basis reflects the above described items net of the impact of start-up costs associated with station acquisitions, format changes and station dispositions.
Digital Media Operating Expenses
The net increase in digital media operating expenses of $0.9 million includes a $0.7 million increase in professional services, a $0.4 million increase in cost of sales, a $0.3 million increase in commissions, a $0.3 million increase in software maintenance fees, a $0.1 million increase in royalties, a $0.1 million increase in advertising and promotional expenses and a $0.1 million increase in bad debt expense, offset by a $0.7 million decrease in support and streaming fees from vendor concessions, a $0.4 million decrease in employee-related expenses due to temporary pay cuts. The increases in advertising and promotion reflect start-up costs from the launch of Townhall VIP, a premium subscription service.
Publishing Operating Expenses
Publishing operating expenses decreased by $0.4 million, including a $0.9 million decrease in payroll-related costs and a $1.4 million decrease in the cost of goods sold that included a $0.7 million decrease from print books sold by Regnery® Publishing, a $0.6 million decline from Salem Author Services due to a lower volume of book sales and a $0.1 million decrease from Salem Publishing, a $0.1 million decrease in advertising and promotion
expenses and a $0.1 million decrease in facility costs, that was offset by a $1.0 million increase in royalty expense reflecting an increase in the reserve for royalty advances based on lower sales, a $0.8 million increase in bad debt expense and a $0.3 million increase in professional services. The gross profit margin for Regnery® Publishing was 44% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 58% for the same period of the prior year as sales volume decreased greater than material costs savings. Regnery® Publishing margins vary based on the volume of e-book sales, which have higher margins due to the nature of delivery and no reserve for sales returns and allowances. The gross profit margin for Salem Author Services improved to 72% from 68% due to lower paper costs for print book sales.
Unallocated Corporate Expenses
Unallocated corporate expenses include shared services, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, that are not directly attributable to any one of our operating segments. The net increase of $0.3 million includes a $0.7 million increase in costs to surrender split dollar life insurance, a $0.2 million increase in office and computer maintenance due to a ransomware attack, a $0.1 million increase in professional services and a $0.1 million increase in facility costs that were offset by a $0.7 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation and a $0.1 million decrease in payroll-related expenses due to company-wide implementation of pay cuts.
Depreciation Expense
The decrease in depreciation expense reflects the impact station assets sold during 2019 and the impact of reduced capital expenditures during 2020 and a reduction in acquisition activity. There were no changes in our depreciation methods or in the estimated useful lives of our asset groups.
Amortization Expense
The decrease in amortization expense reflects the impact of fully amortized domain names, customer lists and contracts, and subscriber base lists that were fully amortized at or near the beginning of the 2020 calendar year resulting in lower amortization expense for this year. There were no changes in our amortization methods or the estimated useful lives of our intangible asset groups.
Change in the Estimated Fair Value of Contingent Earn-Out Consideration
Acquisitions may include contingent earn-out consideration as part of the purchase price under which we will make future payments to the seller upon the achievement of certain benchmarks. We review the probabilities of possible future payments to estimate the fair value of any contingent earn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our forecasts. Should actual results of the acquired business increase or decrease as compared to our estimates and assumptions, the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration liability will increase or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration may materially impact and cause volatility in our operating results.
At December 31, 2020, no estimated contingent earn-out consideration was outstanding compared to $19,000 at December 31, 2019. We recorded a net decrease to our estimated contingent earn-out liabilities of $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net decrease of $41,000 during the prior year. Changes in our estimates of the contingent earn-out reflect the volatility of projected revenue growth, page views and session time. We made $7,000 in cash payments for contingent earn-out consideration during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to no cash payments made in the prior year.
Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Long-Term Assets Other Than Goodwill
We performed an interim review of broadcast licenses for certain markets during the three months ended March 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that began to adversely impact revenue. We engaged an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the fair value of our broadcast licenses. Based on our interim review and analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Chicago, Cleveland, Louisville, Philadelphia, Portland, Sacramento and Tampa. We also recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million to the value of mastheads. These impairments were driven by decreases in projected revenue due to the current estimated impact of COVID-19 and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these factors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations.
The impairment charge of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $1.9 million impairment to broadcast licenses in our Louisville, Philadelphia, Portland and San Francisco markets recorded during interim testing in September 2019 based on market revenue that was trending below the forecasted amounts that were used in our 2018 year-end valuations, a $1.0 million impairment to broadcast licenses in our Tampa market recognized during annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a $17,300 impairment of mastheads recognized during our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2019. These impairment charges were driven by decreases in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the broadcast and publishing industries. We believe that these decreases are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and are not unique to our company or operations.
Impairment of Goodwill
We performed an interim review of goodwill for impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that began to adversely impact revenue. We engaged an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value for certain entities. Based on our interim review and analysis we recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million. These impairments were driven by decreases in projected revenue due to the current estimated impact of COVID-19 and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these factors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations.
During our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2019, we identified operating losses within Eagle Financial Publications and Salem Author Services that indicated that the value of goodwill may be impaired. We engaged an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value. Based on this review and analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.1 million associated with the value of goodwill for Eagle Financial Publications and $0.3 million to the value of goodwill with Salem Author Services.
We believe that these decreases are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and are not unique to our company or operations.
Net (Gain) Loss on the Disposition of Assets
The net loss on the disposition of assets of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $1.4 million estimated pre-tax loss for associated with plans to exit the Miami broadcast market with the pending sale of radio station WKAT-AM and various other fixed asset disposals.
The net loss on the disposition of assets of $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $9.4 million pre-tax loss from the sale of nine radio stations, WAFS-AM in Atlanta, Georgia, WWDJ-AM in Boston, Massachusetts, WHKZ-AM in Cleveland, Ohio, KEXB-AM (formerly KTNO-AM) in Dallas, Texas, KDMT-AM in Denver, Colorado, KTEK-AM in Houston, Texas, KRDY-AM in San Antonio, Texas and KXFN-AM and WSDZ-AM in St. Louis, Missouri, a $4.7 million pre-tax loss from the sale of four radio stations WWMI-AM and WLCC-AM in Tampa, Florida and WZAB-AM and WOCN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) in Miami, Florida, a $3.8 million pre-tax loss on the sale of radio station WSPZ-AM in Washington, D.C., a $1.6 million pre-tax loss from the sale of radio station WDYZ-AM (formerly WORL-AM) in Orlando, Florida, a $1.3 million pre-tax loss on the exchange of radio station KKOL-AM in Seattle, Washington for KPAM-AM in Portland, Oregon, a $0.2 million pre-tax loss on the sale Mike Turner’s line of investment products, a $0.2 million pre-tax loss on the sale of HumanEvents.com, and a $1.5 million estimated pre-tax loss on the pending sale of radio station WBZW-AM in Orlando, Florida, that was partially offset by a $0.4 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a portion of land on our transmitter site in Miami, Florida and a $0.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Newport Natural Health.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest income represents earnings on excess cash and interest due under promissory notes.
Interest expense includes interest due on outstanding debt balances, and non-cash accretion associated with deferred installments and contingent earn-out consideration from certain acquisitions. The decrease of $1.4 million reflects the lower outstanding balance of the Notes, the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility with variable interest rates ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% during 2020 compared to 3.8% to 4.5% during the prior year, and finance lease obligations outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2020.
The gain on the early retirement of long-term debt reflects $3.5 million of repurchases of the Notes at prices below face value resulting in a pre-tax gain of $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $18.7 million of repurchases of the Notes at prices below face value resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 million for the prior year.
Net miscellaneous income and expenses includes miscellaneous receipts such as usage fees for real estate properties and miscellaneous expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $0.1 million in insurance proceeds associated with water damage to one of our radio stations in Los Angeles, California.
Provision for Income Taxes
We recognized provision for income tax of $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.0 million for the prior year. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes, or the effective tax rate was (127.3)% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to (16.7)% for the prior year. The effective tax rate for each period differs from the federal statutory income rate of 21.0% due to the effect of the sale of business assets in various states, state income taxes, certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, and changes in the valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the primary drivers of the effective tax rate include a federal income tax benefit generated from operations of $5.0 million, an additional valuation allowance of $24.3 million relating to federal net operating loss carryforwards and a $10.8 million valuation allowance related to state net operating loss carryforwards, along with permanent differences and other state statutory rate adjustments. The state income tax provision is an accumulation of applicable state income taxes calculated in accordance with each state’s tax laws and each state’s pre-tax income that ranges from various losses to income levels.
Net Loss
Net loss increased by $26.2 million to $54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $27.8 million during the prior year due to the changes described above.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
•
going concern evaluations;
•
revenue recognition;
•
asset impairments, including broadcasting licenses, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets;
•
probabilities associated with the potential for contingent earn-out consideration;
•
fair value measurements;
•
contingency reserves;
•
allowance for doubtful accounts;
•
sales returns and allowances;
•
barter transactions;
•
inventory reserves;
•
reserves for royalty advances;
•
fair value of equity awards;
•
self-insurance reserves;
•
estimated lives for tangible and intangible assets;
•
assessment of contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors to determine the lease term impacting Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities;
•
determining the Incremental Borrowing Rate (“IBR”) for calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities;
•
income tax valuation allowances; and
•
uncertain tax positions.
These estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts to assist as considered necessary.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties could materially impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, broadcast licenses, goodwill and income taxes. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.
We believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Going Concern
Management is responsible for evaluating conditions or events as related to uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures, as applicable. Management’s estimates and assumptions, used in the evaluation of our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date our financial statements are issued, are based on the facts and circumstances at such date and are subject to a material and high level of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the matters themselves being uncertain and subject to modification. The effect of any individual or aggregate changes in the estimates and assumptions, or the facts and circumstances, could be material to the financial statements.
Given the decreases in revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed a variety of factors, including media industry forecasts, expected operating results, forecasted net cash flows from operations, future obligations and liquidity, and capital expenditure commitments. We concluded that the potential that we could incur a considerable decrease in operating income and the resulting impact on our ability to fund interest payments on our debt, were probable conditions which gave rise to a need for an assessment of whether substantial doubt existed of our ability to continue as a going concern.
We reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain cost-cutting measures associated with reductions in staffing, reductions in commissions and royalty expenses based on lower revenue forecasts, reductions in travel and entertainment expenses due to stay-at-home mandates, reductions in event costs, company-wide pay cuts, furloughs of certain employees, and the temporary suspension of the company 401(k) match. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the issuance of the financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determining the amount of revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. We must assess the promises within each sales contract to determine if they are distinct performance obligations. Once the performance obligation(s) are determined, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation(s) based on a relative standalone selling price basis. If a sales contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not determinable, an estimate is used.
We make significant estimates related to variable consideration at the point of sale, including estimates for refunds and product returns. Under ASC Topic 606, estimates of variable consideration are to be recognized
before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances, including when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of any estimated cumulative revenue will not occur.
A growing source of revenue is generated from digital product offerings, which allow for enhanced audience interaction and participation, and integrated digital advertising solutions. When offering digital products, another party may be involved in providing the goods or services that make up a performance obligation to the customer. These include the use of third-party websites for social media campaigns. We must evaluate if we are the principal or agent in order to determine if revenue should be reported gross as principal or net as agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to our customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. The determination of whether we control a specified good or service immediately prior to the good or service being transferred requires us to make reasonable judgments on the nature of each agreement. We have determined that we are acting as principal when we manage all aspects of a social media campaign, including reviewing and approving target audiences, monitoring actual results and making modifications as needed and when we are responsible for delivering campaign results to our customers regardless of the use of a third-party or parties.
Trade and Barter Transactions
In broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Approximately 65% of our total assets at December 31, 2020 consisted of indefinite-lived intangible assets including broadcast licenses and goodwill. These indefinite-lived intangible assets originated from acquisitions in which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcast licenses and goodwill. We do not amortize indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year.
Impairment testing requires an estimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of fair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures as Level 3 inputs discussed in Note 13 of our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment
when considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. These events and circumstances are not all-inclusive and are not by themselves indicators of impairment. We consider external and internal factors when reviewing the following events and circumstances, which are presented in the order of what we believe to be the strongest to weakest indicators of impairment:
(1) the difference between any recent fair value calculations and the carrying value;
(2) financial performance, such as station operating income, including performance as compared to projected results used in prior estimates of fair value;
(3) macroeconomic economic conditions, including limitations on accessing capital that could affect the discount rates used in prior estimates of fair value;
(4) industry and market considerations such as a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in demand, competition, or other economic factors;
(5) operating cost factors, such as increases in labor, that could have a negative effect on future expected earnings and cash flows;
(6) legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors;
(7) other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management or customers; and
(8) any changes to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.
If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, we are required to perform a second step to preparing a quantitative analysis to estimate the fair or enterprise value of the assets. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to: limited trading volume, the impact of our publishing segment operating losses and the significant voting control of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value as part of our quantitative review.
If the results of our quantitative analysis indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
We believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.
Sensitivity of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
When estimating the fair value of broadcast licenses and goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future revenue growth rates, operating cash flow margins and discount rates. These assumptions require substantial judgment that may differ materially from actual results. The following sensitivity analysis shows the incremental impact and the hypothetical non-cash impairment charge that would have result if our estimates were to change by 100 basis points as of the annual testing period in the fourth quarter of 2020:
(1) Each assumption used in the sensitivity analysis is independent of the other assumptions.
The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date. The same discount rate was used in each of our broadcast markets. The discount rate applied to our digital media and publishing entities was higher given the perceived additional risks associated with the cash flows of these businesses.
Operating profit margin is defined as operating income before interest, depreciation, amortization, income tax and corporate allocation charges divided by net revenue. For the fair value analysis, the projections of operating profit margin that are used are based upon industry expectations. These margin projections are not specific to the performance of our radio stations or segments in a market but are predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor. If actual future margins are lower than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.
For the goodwill fair value analysis, the projections of operating margin for each broadcast market and each entity are based on our historical performance. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth declines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.
Long-term revenue growth rates are determined from publicly available information on industry expectations rather than our own estimates, which could differ. Long-term revenue growth rates can vary for each of our broadcast markets. Using industry expectations, each broadcast market, digital and publishing entity’s revenue was forecasted over a ten-year projection period to reflect the projected long-term growth rate. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth declines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.
Business Acquisitions
We account for business acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations. The total acquisition consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. Estimates of the fair value include discounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets and their expected useful lives based on historical experience, market trends and any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition. The excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill and any excess of fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase. Prior to recording a gain, the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re-measurements to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed have been properly valued.
Acquisitions may include contingent earn-out consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts.
A majority of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the FCC licenses to broadcast in a particular market. We often do not acquire the existing format, or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license. Under ASU 2017-01, a fewer number of our radio station acquisitions qualify as business acquisitions and instead are accounted for as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to acquire, including transaction costs. The cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair value with no goodwill recognized.
We may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the acquired net assets as of the acquisition date. As part of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various asset categories in our financial statements. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and require careful consideration and judgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that the purchase price allocations represent the appropriate estimated fair value of the assets acquired and we have not had to modify our purchase price allocations.
We estimate the economic life of each tangible and intangible asset acquired to determine the period of time in which the asset should be depreciated or amortized. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the economic life of each asset. We consider our own experience with similar assets, industry trends, market conditions and the age of the property at the time of our acquisition to estimate the economic life of each asset. If the financial condition of the assets were to deteriorate, the resulting change in life or impairment of the asset could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. To date, we have not experienced changes in the economic life established for each major category of our assets.
Contingent Earn-Out Consideration
Our acquisitions often include contingent earn-out consideration as part of the purchase price. The fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date based on the present value of the contingent payments expected to be made using a weighted probability of possible payments. The unobservable inputs used in the determination of the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration include our own assumptions about the likelihood of payment based on the established benchmarks and discount rates based on our internal rate of return analysis. The fair value measurements include inputs that are Level 3 measurement as discussed in Note 13 in the notes of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 in this annual report.
We review the probabilities of possible future payments to the estimated fair value of any contingent earn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our forecasts. Should actual results increase or decrease as compared to the assumption used in our analysis, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration obligations will increase or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. The changes in our estimates reflect volatility from variables, such as revenue growth, page views and session time
We believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions.
Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and requires expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. The provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This includes applying the fair value concept to (i) nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations; (ii) reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing; (iii) other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments; and (iv) asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.
The fair value provisions include guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasize that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price. If
we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities, quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate.
The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market, and the characteristics specific to the transaction. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less (or no) pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.
FASB ASC Topic 820 established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value. This framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by the FASB ASC Topic 820 hierarchy are as follows:
•
Level 1 Inputs-quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;
•
Level 2 Inputs-inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
•
Level 3 Inputs-unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity’s own data).
We believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our financial assets as discussed in Note 13 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report.
Contingency Reserves
In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We record contingency reserves to the extent we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. The establishment of the reserve is based on a review of all relevant factors, the advice of legal counsel, and the subjective judgment of management. The reserves we have recorded to date have not been material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.
While we believe that the final resolution of any known matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, it is
possible that we could incur additional losses. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Future claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including losses due to costly litigation and losses due to matters that require significant amounts of management time that can result in the diversion of significant operational resources.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We evaluate the balance reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis based on our historical collection experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer information and current economic conditions. We increased our reserve percentages during 2020 based on the adverse economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the expected impact on the ability of our customers to make payments. Past due balances are generally not written-off until all collection efforts have been unsuccessful, including use of a collection agency. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.
Sales Returns and Allowances
We provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return, primarily book sales associated with Regnery® Publishing and nutritional products sold through our wellness division. We record an estimate of these product returns as a reduction of revenue in the period of the sale. Our estimates are based upon historical sales returns, the amount of current period sales, economic trends and any changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. We regularly monitor actual performance to estimated return rates and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience. However, actual returns may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.
Inventory Reserves
Inventories consist of published books from Regnery® Publishing. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value as determined on a First-In First-Out cost method. We review historical data and our own experiences to estimate the fair value of inventory on hand. Our analysis includes reviewing actual sales returns, allowance estimates, royalty reserves, overall economic conditions and demand for each title. We record a provision to expense the balance of unsold inventory that we believe to be unrecoverable. We regularly monitor actual performance to our estimates and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated inventory reserves may be adjusted, either favorably or unfavorably, if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.
Reserves for Royalty Advances
Royalties are paid in advance to book authors and capitalized as prepaid assets. Royalties are expensed as the related book revenue is earned or when we determine that future recovery of the royalty is not likely. We review
historical data associated with royalty advances, earnings and recoverability based on actual results of Regnery® Publishing. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of an advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that we will recover the advance through sales of the book. We apply this historical experience to outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery. A provision is established to expense the balance of any unearned advance which we believe is not recoverable. Our analysis also considers other discrete factors, such as death of an author, any decision to not pursue publication of a title, poor market demand and other relevant factors. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.
Fair Value of Equity Awards
We account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. We record equity awards with stock-based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We determine the fair value of each award using the Black-Scholes valuation model that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of the award granted. The exercise price for each award is equal to or greater than the closing market price of Salem Media Group, Inc. common stock as of the date of the award. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the expected service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of the award, deferred tax assets for awards with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award. We have not modified our estimates or assumptions used in our valuation model. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our stock-based compensation is accurately reflected in our results of operations.
Partial Self-Insurance on Employee Health Plan
We provide health insurance benefits to eligible employees under a self-insured plan whereby we pay actual medical claims subject to certain stop loss limits. We record self-insurance liabilities based on actual claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported. Our estimates are based on historical data and probabilities. Any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors such as future inflation rates, changes in severity, benefit level changes, medical costs and claim settlement patterns. Should the actual amount of claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated, we may adjust our future reserves. Our self-insurance liability was $0.5 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates.
Leases
We account for leases under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We consider all relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception. Our analysis includes whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This consideration involves judgment with respect to whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of the identified asset.
Lease Term - Impact on Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The lease term can materially impact the value of the Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as required under ASC 842. We calculate the term for each lease agreement to include the noncancellable period specified in the agreement together with (1) the periods covered by options to extend the
lease if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option, (2) periods covered by an option to terminate if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option and (3) period covered by an option to extend (or not terminate) if controlled by the lessor. The assessment of whether we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease requires significant judgement surrounding contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors. These factors, detailed below, are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances at the time we enter a lease agreement.
Contract-Based Factors:
•
The existence of a bargain renewal option
•
The existence of contingent or variable payments
•
The nature and terms of renewal or termination options
•
The costs the lessee would incur to restore the asset before returning it to the lessor
Asset-Based Factors:
•
The existence of significant lessee-installed leasehold improvements that would still have economic value when the option becomes exercisable
•
The physical location of the asset
•
The costs that would be incurred to replace or find an alternative asset
Entity-Based Factors:
•
Historical practice
•
Management’s intent
•
Common industry practice
•
The financial impact on the entity of extending or terminating the lease
•
The importance of the leased asset to the entity’s operations
Market-Based Factors:
•
Market rental or purchase rates for comparable assets
•
Potential implications of local regulations and statutory requirements
We have not modified our estimate methodology since adopting ASC 842 on January 1, 2019.
Incremental Borrowing Rate
ROU assets and related lease liabilities recorded under ASC 842 are calculated based on the present value of the lease payments using (1) the rate implicit in the lease or (2) the lessee’s Incremental Borrowing Rate (“IBR”). IBR is defined as the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we estimate the IBR applicable to Salem using significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, and the following available evidence:
The credit history of Salem Media Group
Our most recent credit facility consists of 6.75% Senior Secured Notes and a revolving ABL Facility. As of each month end, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is calculated.
The credit worthiness of Salem Media Group
We review our credit ratings from third parties, including Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Both ratings were downgraded during 2020 to poor quality with very high credit risk.
Class of the underlying asset and the remaining term of the arrangement
We use a portfolio approach applying a single IBR to all leases with reasonably similar characteristics, including the remaining lease term, the underlying assets and the economic environment. We group leases according to the nature of leased asset and the lease term. We have six main categories of leases, (1) Buildings, (2) Equipment, (3) Land, (4) Other (Parking Facilities), (5) Towers and (6) Vehicles.
We consider vehicles to have a higher risk for collateral that is mitigated by the shorter term of the lease that would typically range from three to five years. We consider building and towers to have a higher risk based on (1) the longer lease term of up to thirty years and (2) a higher outstanding balance that is mitigated by the lower risk that the collateralized asset would lose significant value.
The debt incurred under the lease liability as compared to amounts that would be borrowed
We review the cost to finance comparable amounts under our ABL Facility and based on the current market environment as derived from available economic data.
We referred to the Bloomberg Single B Rated Communications Yield Curve (unsecured) and considered adjustments for industry risk factors and the estimated value of the underlying leased asset to be collateral for the debt incurred.
From these data points, we develop a matrix to estimate the IBR for each lease class. We review the IBR estimates on a quarterly basis and update as necessary. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not recognized significant changes in our estimates.
Impairment of ROU Assets
ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment consistent with other long-lived nonfinancial assets. ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present.
ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.
After a careful analysis of the guidance, we concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for testing ROU assets for impairment is the broadcast market cluster level for radio station operations and the entity or division level for digital media entities, publishing entities and networks. Corporate ROU assets are tested on a consolidated level with consideration given to all cash flows of the company as corporate functions do not generate cash flows and are funded by revenue-producing activities at lower levels of the entity.
ASC 360 requires three steps to identify, recognize and measure the impairment of a long-lived asset (asset group) to be held and used:
Step 1-Consider whether Indicators of Impairment are Present
As detailed in ASC 360-10-35-21, the following are examples of impairment indicators:
•
A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group)
•
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition
•
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator
•
An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset (asset group)
•
A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group)
•
A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent.
Other indicators should be considered if we believe that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable.
Step 2-Test for Recoverability
If indicators of impairment are present, we are required to perform a recoverability test comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the long-lived asset or asset group in question to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group.
ASC 360 does not specifically address how operating lease liabilities and future cash outflows for lease payments should be considered in the recoverability test. Under ASC 360, financial liabilities, or long-term debt, generally are excluded from an asset group while operating liabilities, such as accounts payable, generally are included. ASC 842 characterizes operating lease liabilities as operating liabilities. Because operating lease liabilities may be viewed as having attributes of finance liabilities as well as operating liabilities, it is generally acceptable for a lessee to either include or exclude operating lease liabilities from an asset group when testing whether the carrying amount of an asset group is recoverable provided the approach is applied consistently for all operating leases and when performing Steps 2 and 3 of the impairment model in ASC 360.
In cases where we have received lease incentives, including operating lease liabilities in an asset group may result in the long-lived asset or asset group having a zero or negative carrying amount because the incentives reduce our ROU assets. We elected to exclude operating lease liabilities from the carrying amount of the asset group such that we test ROU assets for operating leases in the same manner that we test ROU assets for financing leases.
Undiscounted Future Cash Flows
The undiscounted future cash flows in Step 2 are based on our own assumptions rather than a market participant. If an election is made to exclude operating lease liabilities from the asset or asset group, all future cash lease payments for the lease should also be excluded. The standard requires lessees to exclude certain variable lease payments from lease payments and, therefore, from the measurement of a lessee’s lease liabilities. Because these variable payments do not reduce the lease liability, we include the variable payments we expect to make in our estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in the recoverability test (Step 2) using a probability-weighted approach.
Step 3-Measurement of an Impairment Loss
If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (asset group), we are required to estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group and
recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value. We elected to exclude operating lease liabilities from the estimated fair value, consistent with the recoverability test. Any impairment loss for an asset group must reduce only the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset or assets of the group, including the ROU assets. The loss must be allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group must not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value whenever the fair value is determinable without undue cost and effort. ASC 360 prohibits the subsequent reversal of an impairment loss for an asset held and used.
Fair Value Considerations
When determining the fair value of a ROU asset, we must estimate what market participants would pay to lease the asset or what a market participant would pay up front in one payment for the ROU asset, assuming no additional lease payments would be due. The ROU asset must be valued assuming its highest and best use, in its current form, even if that use differs from the current or intended use. If no market exists for an asset in its current form, but there is a market for a transformed asset, the costs to transform the asset are considered in the fair value estimate. Refer to Note 13, Fair Value Measurements.
There were no indications of impairment during the period ended December 31, 2020.
Income Tax Valuation Allowances (Deferred Taxes)
In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax consider current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by tax authorities. Reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities are established if necessary. Although we believe our judgments, assumptions and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the tax implications are known. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance.
As a result of our adjusted cumulative three-year pre-tax book loss as of December 31, 2020, we performed quarterly assessments of positive and negative evidence with respect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The economic uncertainty from the
COVID-19 pandemic provided additional negative evidence that outweighed positive evidence resulting in our conclusion that additional deferred tax assets of $35.1 million related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are more likely than not to be not realized. As such, an additional valuation allowance of $35.1 million was recorded, for a total valuation allowance of $48.1 million as of the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions
We are subject to audit and review by various taxing jurisdictions. We may recognize liabilities on our financial statements for positions taken on uncertain tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to make estimates based on the various possible outcomes. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.
We review and reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions around our subsidiary Salem Communications Holding Company’s Pennsylvania tax filing. The position taken on the tax returns follows Pennsylvania Notice 2016-01 which provides guidance for reversal of intercompany interest income and associated expense yielding a net loss for Pennsylvania. The current liability recognized for the tax position is $0.3 million including interest and penalties. Our evaluation was performed for all tax years that remain subject to examination, which range from 2016 through 2019.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal sources of funds are operating cash flows, borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of selected assets or businesses. We have historically funded, and will continue to fund, expenditures for operations, administrative expenses, and capital expenditures from these sources. We have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings, including borrowings under credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, from operating cash flow and from proceeds on selected asset dispositions. We expect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income-producing assets or proceeds from debt and equity offerings.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising spend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives substantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events.
Future availability under our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on
the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at December 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019.
In response to these developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate cash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including:
•
limiting capital expenditures;
•
reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment;
•
eliminating open positions and freezing new hires;
•
reducing staffing levels;
•
implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level;
•
furloughing certain employees;
•
temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match;
•
requesting rent concessions from landlords;
•
requesting discounts from vendors;
•
offering early payment discounts to certain customers in exchange for advance cash payments; and
•
suspending the payment of distributions on our common stock indefinitely.
We have utilized certain benefits of the CARES Act, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including:
•
the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in December 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;
•
relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and
•
Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.
Due to the adverse economic impact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and expected funding needs, we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the issuance of this annual report.
During 2020 we began to keep higher balances of cash and cash equivalents on-hand to meet operating needs due to the adverse economic conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, we keep the balance of cash and cash equivalents low in order to reduce the balance of outstanding debt. Our ABL Facility automatically covers any shortfalls in operating cash flows such that we are not required to hold excess cash balances on hand. Our cash and cash equivalents increased to $6.3 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $6,000 at December 31, 2019. Working capital increased $6.3 million to $(5.1) million at December 31, 2020 compared to ($11.4 million) at December 31, 2019 due to the $6.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $3.2 million increase in assets held for sale and a $7.4 million decrease in the outstanding balance on the ABL Facility, that was partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $6.4 million, an increase in contract liabilities of $2.2 million.
Operating Cash Flows
Our largest source of operating cash inflows are receipts from customers in exchange for advertising and programming. Other sources of operating cash inflows include receipts from customers for digital downloads and streaming, book sales, subscriptions, self-publishing fees, ticket sales, sponsorships, and vendor promotions. The adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our revenue and cash receipts from customers. A majority of our operating cash outflows consist of payments to employees, such as salaries and benefits, and vendor payments under facility and tower leases, talent agreements, inventory purchases and recurring services such as utilities and music license fees. Our operating cash flows are subject to factors such as fluctuations in preferred advertising media and changes in demand caused by shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, and audience tastes. In addition, our operating cash flows may be affected if our customers are unable to pay, delay payment of amounts owed to us, or if we experience reductions in revenue, or increases in costs and expenses.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $22.8 million from $17.0 million during the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of the following items:
•
Trade accounts receivables, net of allowances, decreased by $6.4 million compared to a decrease of $2.2 million for the prior year;
•
Operating expenses exclusive of depreciation, amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, impairments and net gain (loss) on the disposition of assets, decreased by $6.6 million;
•
Unbilled revenue increased $0.2 million;
•
Our Day’s Sales Outstanding, or the average number of days to collect cash from the date of sale, decreased to 59 days at December 31, 2020 from 60 days in the same period of the prior year;
•
We deferred cash payments of $3.3 million for the employer portion of FICA taxes as allowed under the CARES Act with 50% due December 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 2022; and
•
We reduced cash paid for rent by $1.0 million of which $0.3 million was abated and $0.7 million was deferred over pay-back periods ranging from one-month in 2020 to forty-four months through December 2024.
Investing Cash Flows
Our primary source of investing cash inflows includes proceeds from the sale of assets or businesses. Investing cash outflows include cash payments made to acquire businesses, to acquire property and equipment and to acquire intangible assets such as domain names. While our focus continues to be on deleveraging, we remain committed to explore and pursue strategic acquisitions.
In recent years, we entered acquisition agreements that contain contingent earn-out arrangements that are payable in the future based on the achievement of predefined operating results. We believe that these contingent earn-out arrangements provide some degree of protection with regard to our cash outflows should these acquisitions not meet our operational expectations.
We undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and/or FCC broadcast licenses, expand our digital and web-based offerings, improve our facilities and upgrade our computer infrastructures. The nature and timing of these upgrades and expenditures can be delayed or scaled back at the discretion of management. Based on our current plans, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $11.6 million during 2021. As noted, we are currently limiting capital expenditures to emergency-only type expenses.
We plan to fund any future purchases and any future acquisitions from cash on hand, operating cash flow or our credit facilities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $10.9 million during the prior year. The $13.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was the result of:
•
Proceeds from the sale of assets decreased $20.5 million to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $20.7 million of cash during same period of the prior year;
•
Proceeds of $2.4 million were received from surrendering split-dollar life insurance policies;
•
Cash paid for capital expenditures decreased $3.2 million to $4.6 million from $7.8 million during the same period of the prior year; and
•
Cash paid for acquisitions decreased $0.9 million to $0.4 million compared to $1.3 million during the same period of the prior year.
Financing Cash Flows
Financing cash inflows include borrowings under our credit facilities and any proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under our stock incentive plan. Financing cash outflows include repayments of our credit facilities, the payment of distributions on our common stock and payments of amounts due under deferred installments and contingency earn-out consideration associated with acquisition activity.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal balances outstanding under the Notes and ABL Facility ranged from $221.3 million to $235.4 million. These outstanding balances were ordinary and customary based on our operating and investing cash needs during this time.
Our sole source of cash available for making any future distributions on our common stock is our operating cash flow, subject to our credit facilities and Notes, which contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends and distributions to our equity holders unless certain specified conditions are satisfied. On May 6, 2020 our Board voted to discontinue distributions on our common stock indefinitely due to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $14.4 million to $13.6 million compared to $28.0 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash used for financing activities includes:
•
A $5.1 million decrease in cash distributions on common stock to $0.7 million from $5.8 million,
•
Net payments on our ABL Facility were $7.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net payments of $7.2 million during the prior year; and
•
We used $3.4 million of cash to repurchase $3.5 million in face value of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes compared to $16.8 million of cash to repurchase $18.7 million during the prior year.
6.75% Senior Secured Notes
On May 19, 2017, we issued the Notes in a private placement. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year and mature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest initially accrued on the Notes from May 19, 2017 and is payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2017.
The Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors other than the ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as described below) (the “Notes Priority Collateral”). There is no
direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).
The Notes were redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or before June 1, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a “make-whole” premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or after June 1, 2020, the Notes are redeemable at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.
The indenture relating to the Notes (the “Indenture”) contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain specified exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments; (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or transfer assets.
The Indenture provides for the following events of default (each, an “Event of Default”): (i) default in payment of principal or premium on the Notes at maturity, upon repurchase, acceleration, optional redemption or otherwise; (ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes; (iii) the failure by us or certain restricted subsidiaries to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Notes, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) the failure of any guarantee by certain significant Subsidiary Guarantors to be in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to notice and lapse of time; (v) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period) of other indebtedness of ours or any restricted subsidiary if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) is at least $15 million; (vi) certain judgments for the payment of money in excess of $15 million; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us or any significant subsidiary; and (viii) certain defaults with respect to any collateral having a fair market value in excess of $15 million. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of the Notes and any accrued interest on the Notes to be due and payable immediately, subject to remedy or cure in certain cases. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture.
Based on the balance of the Notes currently outstanding, we are required to pay $14.6 million per year in interest on the Notes. As of December 31, 2020, accrued interest on the Notes was $1.2 million.
We incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a reduction of the debt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense.
We may from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to repurchase the Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions warrant.
Based on the then existing market conditions, we completed repurchases of our 6.75% Senior Secured Notes at amounts less than face value as follows:
Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility
On May 19, 2017, the company entered into the ABL Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among us and our subsidiaries party thereto as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lead arranger, and the lenders that are parties thereto. We used the proceeds of the ABL Facility, together with the net proceeds from the Notes offering, to repay outstanding borrowings under our previously existing senior credit facilities, and related fees and expenses. Current proceeds from the ABL Facility are used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.
The ABL Facility is a five-year $30.0 million revolving credit facility due March 1, 2024, which includes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans. All borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which is based on an availability-based measure, ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 2.00% per annum. Amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility may be paid and then reborrowed at our discretion without penalty or premium. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance from 0.25% to 0.375% per year based on the level of borrowings.
On October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with respect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a waiver permitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack.
On April 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and extended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The
April 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021.
Availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. As of December 31, 2020, the amount available under the ABL Facility was $24.2 million of which $5.0 million was outstanding. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets (the “ABL Facility Priority Collateral”) and by a second-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral. There is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).
The Credit Agreement includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, which is tested during the period commencing on the last day of the fiscal month most recently ended prior to the date on which Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of 15% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and $4.5 million and continuing for a period of 60 consecutive days after the first day on which Availability exceeds such threshold amount. The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries (i) to incur additional indebtedness; (ii) to make investments; (iii) to make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) to enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) to sell assets; (vi) to enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) to merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) to prepay indebtedness; and (ix) to pay dividends.
The Credit Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) default for non-payment of any principal or letter of credit reimbursement when due or any interest, fees or other amounts within five days of the due date; (ii) the failure by any borrower or any subsidiary to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement or any other loan document, in certain cases subject to applicable notice and lapse of time; (iii) any representation or warranty made pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other loan document is incorrect in any material respect when made; (iv) certain defaults of other indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary of indebtedness of at least $10 million; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to any borrower or any subsidiary; (vi) certain judgments for the payment of money of $10 million or more; (vii) a change of control; and (viii) certain defaults relating to the loss of FCC licenses, cessation of broadcasting and termination of material station contracts. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under Credit Agreement.
We incurred debt issue costs of $0.9 million that were recorded as an asset and are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the ABL Facility was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2020, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was 2.5%.
We report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and customary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement.
Summary of long-term debt obligations
Long-term debt consisted of the following:
In addition to the outstanding amounts listed above, we also have interest payments related to our long-term debt as follows as of December 31, 2020:
•
$5.0 million under the ABL Facility, with interest spread ranging from Base Rate plus 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings;
•
$216.3 million aggregate principal amount of Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of 6.75%; and
•
Commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility.
Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations
Principal repayment requirements under all long-term debt agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020 for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:
Impairment Losses on Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We have incurred impairment losses associated with goodwill and indefinite lived assets, including broadcast licenses and mastheads. These impairment losses were attributable to declines in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the broadcast, digital and publishing industries. The long-term revenue growth rates are specific for each market and ranged from 0.5%-1.2% as of the 2018 testing period to a range of 0.7%-1.1% as of the 2019 testing period resulting in a decline in operating profit margins from 4.4%-34.5% in 2018 to 4.0%-33.8% in 2019. Long-term revenue growth rates for digital media entities were 1.0% during the 2018 annual testing to a range of 0.5%-1.0% as of the 2019 testing period while publishing long-term revenue growth rates
were 1.0% during the 2018 annual testing period to 0.5% during the 2019 testing period. Declines in excess of these amounts and/or failure to achieve the anticipated growth rates may result in future impairment losses, the amount of which may be material.
The valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. The fair value measurements for our indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective market clusters and reporting units.
While the impairment charges we have recognized are non-cash in nature and have not violated any debt covenants, the potential for future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows. We believe that we have adequately considered the potential for an economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the non-cash impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Not required for smaller reporting companies.
