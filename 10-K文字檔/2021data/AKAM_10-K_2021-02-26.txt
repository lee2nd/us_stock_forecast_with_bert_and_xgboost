Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof.
Overview
We provide solutions for securing, delivering and optimizing content and business applications over the internet. The key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our security and performance offerings, increase media traffic on our network, effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions, develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses.
Revenue
For most of our solutions, our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer, which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue. In addition to a base level of revenue, we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable. As a result, our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network, the rate of adoption of gaming, social media and video platform offerings, the timing and variability of customer-specific one-time events and geopolitical, economic and other developments that impact our customers' businesses. Seasonal variations that impact traffic on our network, such as holiday shopping, can cause revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter. Over the longer term, our ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are key factors impacting our revenue growth.
We have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years:
•Increased sales of our security solutions have made a significant contribution to revenue growth. We plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities, particularly in certain markets and through our channel partners.
•We have experienced increases in the amount of traffic delivered for customers that use our solutions for video, gaming downloads and social media, contributing to an increase in our revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and resultant pandemic-related shutdowns and restrictions in various locations around the world during some of 2020, the rate of growth in traffic in 2020, as compared to prior years, accelerated significantly due to increased consumption of streaming media and games online and online commerce. We expect this year-over-year growth to moderate in 2021, assuming the restrictions experienced in 2020 do not continue.
•While we have increased committed recurring revenue from our solutions by upselling incremental solutions to our existing customers and adding new customers, we have also experienced slower revenue growth in recent quarters in our web performance solutions. We expect the trend of slower revenue growth in our web solutions to continue in 2021 as our customers, particularly in the commerce and travel and hospitality industries, continue to experience financial pressure, especially in light of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on these customers' operations.
•The prices paid by some of our customers have declined, particularly in the context of contract renewals and large media consolidations, reflecting the impact of competition and volume discounts. Our revenue would have been higher absent these price declines.
•Revenue from our international operations has been growing at a faster pace than from our U.S. operations, particularly in terms of new customer acquisition and cross-selling of incremental solutions. Because we publicly report in U.S. dollars, if the dollar strengthens, our reported revenue results will be negatively impacted. Conversely, a continuing weaker dollar would benefit our reported results.
•We have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter. In particular, we typically experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity. In addition, we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to, among other things, the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers; whether there are large live sporting or other events or situations (like the COVID-19 pandemic) that impact the amount of media traffic on our network; and the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions or licensed software.
Expenses
Our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses, including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and co-location costs. We have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years:
•Our profitability improved in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to higher revenue and the effects of cost savings and efficiency initiatives we have undertaken in recent years, as well as from lower travel and marketing expenses in 2020 due to pandemic-related shutdowns and restrictions. In order to maintain our current levels of profitability, we will need to continue to undertake efforts intended to improve the efficiency of operations and ensure that our expense growth does not exceed our revenue growth.
•Network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. Historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. Our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels and serving more traffic from higher cost regions. We will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability.
•Co-location costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue. By improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we have been able to manage the growth of co-location costs. We expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to continue to effectively manage our co-location costs to maintain current levels of profitability.
•We expect to continue to manage our headcount and payroll costs in the future to focus investments on certain areas of the business while maintaining efficient operations in others. We expect to continue to hire employees in support of our strategic initiatives but do not expect overall headcount to increase significantly in 2021.
•Depreciation expense related to our network equipment also contributes to our overall expense levels. During the last three quarters of 2020, we accelerated our purchases of servers and other equipment used in our network to help meet the increased traffic demands arising during the COVID-19 pandemic and to make up for supply chain issues we experienced in the first quarter. We expect to see higher depreciation expense in 2021 to reflect the deployment of this equipment. We plan to continue to invest in our network in 2021, although not at the same levels we experienced in 2020, which will further increase our capital expenditures and resulting depreciation expense.
We currently report our revenue by division, which is a customer-focused reporting view that reflects revenue from customers that are managed by the division. We report our revenue in two divisions: the Web Division and the Media and Carrier Division. As the purchasing patterns and required account expertise of customers change over time, we may reassign a customer from one division to another. In 2020, we reassigned some of our customers between the Media and Carrier Division and the Web Division and revised historical results in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented.
In March 2021, we will reorganize into two groups: the Edge Technology Group, or ETG, and the Security Technology Group, or STG. The reorganization will align leaders of the two groups around our product offerings, with support from a single global sales organization, and is intended to position us to become more agile in delivering our solutions. Beginning in 2021, we will report revenue from the STG (previously Cloud Security Solutions revenue) and the ETG (revenue from our remaining solutions), separately.
Nearly all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are not requiring employees whose roles do not require in-person presence to perform their jobs to return to offices before January 1, 2022. We have implemented a comprehensive evaluation process to determine whether offices in different locations should be open or closed. Our operations have not been significantly disrupted by the shift to remote working. While we expect to incur expenses associated with enabling remote work and reconfiguring work spaces to help ensure the safety and well being of employees accessing our locations, we do not currently believe those costs will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.
Results of Operations
The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated:
Revenue
Revenue during the periods presented is as follows (in thousands):
The increase in our revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes due in part to behavioral changes prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic and continued strong growth in sales of our Cloud Security Solutions. Cloud Security Solutions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,061.6 million, compared to $848.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represents a 25.1% increase. The increase in our revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes, including from our large internet platform customers, and continued strong growth in sales of our Cloud Security Solutions. Cloud Security Solutions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $848.7 million, compared to $658.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents a 28.8% increase.
The increase in Web Division revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019, and 2019 as compared to 2018, was primarily the result of increased sales of both new and existing Cloud Security Solutions to this customer base. Customers that have been experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically those in the commerce, retail and travel and hospitality verticals, are primarily assigned to our Web Division. Accordingly, Web Division revenue was negatively impacted during 2020 as a result of this pandemic. It is difficult to predict the length of time and amount by which the Web Division will continue to be impacted by the pandemic given its uncertain nature.
The increase in Media and Carrier Division revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery, gaming and social media usage, due in part to behavioral changes tied to the COVID-19 and higher sales of Cloud Security Solutions. The increase in Media and Carrier Division revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery and gaming customers and higher sales of Cloud Security Solutions.
Revenue derived in the U.S. and internationally during the periods presented is as follows (in thousands):
The U.S. revenue growth rate for 2020 was positively impacted by the increase in traffic on our network in 2020, including from our U.S.-based large internet platform customers. The U.S. revenue growth rate for 2019 was negatively impacted by a reduction in prices paid by some of our customers, partially offset by an increase in revenue from large internet platform companies, as these companies are based in the U.S.
Internationally, during 2020 and 2019, we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the Asia-Pacific region. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by $1.2 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, and negatively impacted our revenue by $33.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 44% of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the U.S., compared to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 38% for the year ended December 31, 2018. No single country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of revenue during any of these periods.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):
The increase in total cost of revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to increases in investments in our network to support current and anticipated future traffic growth, which resulted in increases to amounts paid for network build-out and supporting services, higher depreciation costs of our network equipment and higher expenses related to our co-location facilities. Bandwidth fees also increased during this period due to growth in the amount of traffic served on our network.
The increase in total cost of revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increases in amortization of internal-use software as we continued to release internally-developed software onto our network related to new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services, network build-out and supporting service costs due to investments in network expansion and bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of network equipment of $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to software and hardware initiatives we implemented to manage our global network more efficiently, resulting in an increase in the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers, from four to five years effective January 1, 2019.
During 2021, we plan to continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating margins, including continuing to manage our bandwidth and co-location costs. We anticipate depreciation of network equipment to increase in 2021 due to increased investments in our network to address expected traffic increases.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):
The increases in research and development expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were due to growth in payroll and related costs as a result of merit increases and headcount growth to support investments in new product development and
network scaling. These increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internal-use software deployed on our network.
The increases in research and development expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 were due to increases in payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling, and as a result of employees joining us through acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internal-use software deployed on our network.
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. Capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we capitalized $35.7 million, $33.7 million and $31.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. These capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two years, but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life.
We expect research and development costs to increase in 2021 as we plan to maintain our focus on innovation; however, we do not expect these costs to increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to manage costs.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):
During much of 2020, restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the cancellation or postponement of in-person marketing events and led to a decline in travel expenses such as airfare, lodging and other costs related to in-person customer events and meetings; as a result, we experienced a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased spending for marketing programs and other expenses, primarily for a customer conference that took place during 2019 that did not take place in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation due to reduced headcount in the marketing organization.
We expect the decreased level of marketing and travel related expenditures to continue into 2021 as we continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also plan to continue to carefully manage costs in our efforts to refine and optimize our go-to-market efforts and manage operating margins.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):
The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
•an endowment contribution to the Akamai Foundation in 2020, which did not occur in 2019, to support the Foundation's increased initiatives (for additional information see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K);
•expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2019, including moving into our new corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which increased facilities-related costs and depreciation and amortization in 2020; and
•a reduction to license patent fees as a result of our litigation with Limelight Networks, Inc., or Limelight, that did not recur in 2020.
The 2020 increases in general and administrative expenses were also partially offset by a decrease in amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services as well as a legal settlement charge in 2019.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the 2018 contribution to the Akamai Foundation, a reduction in legal and stockholder matter costs and a decrease in other expenses due to a decrease in non-income tax reserves. These decreases were partially offset by cessation of payments to us under the terms of the litigation settlement agreement with Limelight.
General and administrative expenses for 2020 and 2019 are broken out by category as follows (in thousands):
Global functions expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs for administrative functions, including finance, purchasing, order entry, human resources, legal, information technology and executive personnel, as well as third-party professional service fees. Infrastructure expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other
employee-related costs for our network infrastructure functions, as well as facility rent expense, depreciation and amortization of facility and IT-related assets, software and software-related costs, business insurance and taxes. Our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning, sourcing, architecture evaluation and platform security. Other expense includes acquisition-related costs, provision for doubtful accounts, legal settlements, non-routine stockholder matter costs, the endowment contribution to the Akamai Foundation, transformation costs and the licensing of a patent.
During 2021, we plan to continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating margins.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2020 as compared to 2019, as well as 2019 as compared to 2018, was the result of amortization of assets related to our recent acquisitions.
Based on acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2020, future amortization is expected to be $47.4 million, $43.8 million, $36.3 million, $28.4 million and $22.9 million for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Restructuring Charge
The restructuring charge in 2020 was primarily the result of management actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 to better position us to become more agile in delivering our solutions. The restructuring charge for this action relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action. Also included in 2020 is an $8.7 million impairment of lease related assets incurred to exit leased facilities related to the 2019 action.
The restructuring charge in 2019 was primarily the result of management actions that focused on investments with the potential to accelerate revenue growth. The restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action.
The restructuring charge in 2018 was primarily the result of management actions intended to re-balance investments to focus on long-term growth and scale. The restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action.
In addition to the actions described above, we have also recognized restructuring charges for redundant employees, facilities and contracts associated with completed acquisitions.
We expect to incur up to $7.0 million in 2021 for severance and related benefits related to the 2020 action. We do not expect to incur any material additional charges related to previously completed acquisitions.
Non-Operating Income (Expense)
For the periods presented, interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. The decrease to interest income in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of investing in marketable securities having lower rates of return due to lower interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase to interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our August 2019 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027.
Interest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The increase to interest expense for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the August 2019 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027, or 2027 Notes, which bear regular interest of 0.375%, but have an effective interest rate of 3.1% due to the conversion feature. The increase to interest expense for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the May 2018 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025, which bear regular interest of 0.125%, but have an effective interest rate of 4.26% due to the conversion feature, and the issuance of the 2027 Notes.
Other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other non-functional currency transactions. Other expense, net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events. Other expense, net also includes a $7.2 million gain from the sale of an equity investment in 2020.
Provision for Income Taxes
The decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2020 as compared to 2019 was mainly due to a decrease in intercompany sales of intellectual property, a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits and an increase in foreign income taxed at lower rates. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in profit before tax and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statues of limitations in 2019.
The increase in the provision for income taxes for 2019 as compared to 2018 was mainly due to an increase in profit before taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits. These amounts were partially offset by the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the impact of the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation, state taxes and the valuation allowance recorded against tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the benefit of the U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These amounts were partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits, non-deductible executive compensation, an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, a decrease in the provisional amount of the one-time transition tax that was recorded in 2017, the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes.
Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates.
Refer to Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations.
Loss from Equity Method Investment
During 2019, we began recognizing our share of earnings from our investment with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in a joint venture, Global Open Network, Inc., or GO-NET. GO-NET intends to operate a new blockchain-based online payment network. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the losses recognized reflect our share of the losses incurred by GO-NET as well as an $11.0 million impairment charge to adjust our carrying value of our investment to fair value, due to a modified business plan and continued negative projected cash flows. We expect to record additional equity method losses in 2021 and beyond as GO-NET continues executing on the early stages of its business plan.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results.
The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.
The non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:
•Amortization of acquired intangible assets - We have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions we have made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.
•Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation - Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies.
•Acquisition-related costs - Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities. In addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related costs. These amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations.
•Restructuring charges - We have incurred restructuring charges that are included in our GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.
•Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense - In August 2019, we issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0.375%. In May 2018, we issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%. In February 2014, we issued $690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0%. The imputed interest rates of these convertible senior notes were 3.10%, 4.26% and 3.20%, respectively. This is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that are required to be separately accounted for as equity under GAAP, thereby reducing the carrying values of the convertible debt instruments. The debt discounts are amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. The interest expense excluded from our non-GAAP results is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.
•Gains and losses on investments - We have recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
•Legal and stockholder matter costs - We have incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters and costs from professional service providers related to a non-routine stockholder matter. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations.
•Endowment of Akamai Foundation - We have incurred expenses to endow the Akamai Foundation, a private corporate foundation dedicated to encouraging the next generation of technology innovators by supporting math and science education. Our first endowment was in 2018 to enable a permanent endowment for the Akamai Foundation to allow it to expand its reach. In the fourth quarter of 2020 we supplemented the endowment to enable specific initiatives to increase diversity in the technology industry. We believe excluding these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as these infrequent expenses are not representative of our core business operations.
•Transformation costs - We have incurred professional services fees associated with internal changes that are designed to improve operating margins and that are part of a discrete planned transformation program intended to significantly change the manner in which business is conducted. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events and activities giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
•Income and losses from equity method investment - We record income or losses on our share of earnings and losses from our equity method investment. We exclude such income and losses because we do not direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of our core business operations.
•Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items - The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. We believe that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations.

During 2020, our average stock price was in excess of $95.10, which is the initial conversion price of our convertible senior notes due in 2025. See further discussion below.
(2) May not foot due to rounding.
Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share. Unless our weighted average stock price is greater than $95.10, the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025, or $116.18, the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2027, there will be no difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs from professional service providers related to a non-routine stockholder matter; costs incurred related to endowment contributions to the Akamai Foundation; transformation costs; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; gains and losses from equity method investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results. Consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, generally our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted.
Because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and U.S. government agency obligations, totaled $2.5 billion. Factoring in our outstanding convertible senior notes of $2.3 billion, our net cash at December 31, 2020 was $196.9 million. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times.
Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as accounts receivable, deferred revenue, accounts payable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repurchases and issuances, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. The events related to the COVID-19 pandemic have not had a material impact to our
liquidity in 2020; however, we continue to monitor our customer base, particularly those in industries most impacted by the pandemic, and their ability to pay us for our services or to pay us in a timely manner due to financial stresses the outbreak may have caused them. We believe that, particularly in situations like these, our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial stability and flexibility to enable us to continue to make investments at opportune times.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $278.7 million held in accounts outside the U.S. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act establishes a territorial tax system in the U.S., which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal U.S. federal income tax impact beginning in 2018. As a result, our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the U.S.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2020 and timing of vendor payments. The increase was partially offset by the timing of payments from customers.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2019, partially offset by the timing of cash collections from customers, an increase of $28.8 million in cash paid for income taxes and timing of collections and payments of other working capital items.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities. During 2019 we invested some of the proceeds from our August 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes in marketable securities, which increased our purchases in that year and did not recur in 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment during 2020 to support the increase in traffic we experienced on our network and expect to continue to experience in the future.
The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in purchases of marketable securities with the proceeds from our August 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes, cash paid for acquired companies in 2019, increased capital expenditures and cash invested in an equity method investment.
Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities
The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to the net proceeds received from our August 2019 issuance of our convertible senior notes and related bond hedge and warrant transaction. The increase was partially offset by the repayment of our convertible senior notes that were due in February 2019 and a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs.
The change in net cash used in or provided by financing activities during 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to our repayment of $690 million of aggregate principal of convertible notes in 2019, partially offset by a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs.
Effective November 2018, the board of directors authorized a $1.1 billion repurchase program through December 2021. Our goal for the share repurchase programs is to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant. As of December 31, 2020, we have $571.9 million available for future purchases of shares under this repurchase program.
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 2.0 million, 4.0 million and 10.2 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $98.53, $82.90 and $73.54, respectively.
Convertible Senior Notes
In August 2019, we issued $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. We have used and expect to continue to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
In May 2018, we issued $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our $690.0 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019. In addition, we have used and expect to continue to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
In February 2014, we issued $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. We repaid the full $690.0 million in principal amount of the notes in cash in February 2019, as the notes matured and no conversions occurred.
The terms of the notes and the hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Revolving Credit Facility
In May 2018, we entered into a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. The facility provides for an initial $500.0 million in revolving loans. Under specified circumstances, the facility can be increased to up to $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.875% to 1.25%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our
consolidated leverage ratio specified in the Credit Agreement. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Agreement, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.075% to 0.15%, with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020.
Liquidity Outlook
Based on our present business plan, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures, investments in information technology, opportunistic business acquisitions, anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other long-term liabilities.
Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments
The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2020, for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):
(1) Excludes $13.6 million of obligations for operating leases that have not yet commenced. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $29.5 million, including $7.7 million of accrued interest and penalties. We believe that it is reasonably possible that $9.6 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2021. The settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown.
Letters of Credit
As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding $5.8 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. These irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above, are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2026.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. The fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2020 and 2019 was determined to be immaterial.
Legal Matters
We are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. We do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Overview
Our MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Definitions
We define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes.
Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. Determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management. Advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct; rather, they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation. Different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
Determination of the standalone selling price, or SSP, also requires the exercise of judgment by management. SSP is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately, or the discounted list price per management’s approved price list. In cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available, a cost-plus-margin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine SSP. Changes to SSP could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations, which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. Consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price. If the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service, revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered. Different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized.
We may also resell the licenses or services of third parties. If we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services, the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled, after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation. Different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized.
Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record allowance against our accounts receivable balance, primarily for current expected credit losses. Increases and decreases in the allowance for current expected credit losses are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Estimates are used in determining our allowance for current expected credit losses using historical loss rates for the previous twelve months as well as expectations about the future where we have been able to develop forecasts to supports our estimates. In addition, the allowance for current expected credit losses considers outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. We assess collectibility based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for services previously provided. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in the creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments.
Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities
We measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability.
Marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. We periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for, the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends; and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. Write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment.
Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets
We review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations.
Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. We have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date.
Acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. We engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets.
Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized.
We currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections.
We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated.
Uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on technical merit, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
We issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. We measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. We have selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. Changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. Changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations.
Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs
We capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. We periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.
