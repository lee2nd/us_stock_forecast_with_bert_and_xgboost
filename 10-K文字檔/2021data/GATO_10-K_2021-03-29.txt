Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and the other information included elsewhere in this Report.
Overview
We are a U.S.-based precious metals production, development and exploration company with the objective of becoming a premier silver producer. We are currently focused on the production and continued development of the CLG and the further exploration and development of the Los Gatos District:
•
The CLG, located within the Los Gatos District, Chihuahua, Mexico, consists of a 2,500 tpd polymetallic mine and processing facility that commenced concentrate sales on September 1, 2019.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the CLG mined 652,739 tonnes and processed 667,422 tonnes at average grades of 229 g/t silver, 0.42 g/t gold, 2.27% lead and 3.64% zinc, with metallurgical recovery of 84.1% silver, 61.9% gold, 86.6% lead and 72.8% zinc. A total of 21,176 tonnes of lead concentrate were produced at average grades of 5,295 g/t silver, 7.3 g/t gold, 58.9% lead and 10.1% zinc, with metallurgical recovery of 72.7% silver, 55.4% gold, 82.3% lead and 8.8% zinc. A total of 27,879 tonnes of zinc concentrate were produced at average grades of 619 g/t silver, 0.66 g/t gold, 2.4% lead and 55.6% zinc, with metallurgical recovery of 11.3% silver, 6.6% gold, 4.3% lead and 63.9% zinc. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the CLG mined 357,342 tonnes and processed 269,853 tonnes at average grades of 229 g/t silver, 0.52 g/t gold, 1.97% lead and 3.03% zinc, with metallurgical
recovery of 82.1% silver, 63.5% gold, 83.4% lead and 72.3% zinc. A total of 7,188 tonnes of lead concentrate were produced at average grades of 5,774 g/t silver, 10.9 g/t gold, 56.3% lead and 12.6% zinc, with metallurgical recovery of 67.3% silver, 55.2% gold, 76.0% lead and 11.1% zinc. A total of 9,320 tonnes of zinc concentrate were produced at average grades of 978 g/t silver, 1.26 g/t gold, 4.2% lead and 53.7% zinc, with metallurgical recovery of 14.8% silver, 8.3% gold, 7.4% lead and 61.2% zinc.
 
The Los Gatos Technical Report estimates that the deposit contains approximately 9.6 million diluted tonnes of proven and probable mineral reserves (or approximately 5.0 million diluted tonnes of proven and probable mineral reserves on a 51.5% basis), with approximately 6.4 million diluted tonnes of proven mineral reserves (or approximately 3.3 million diluted tonnes of proven mineral reserves on a 51.5% basis) and approximately 3.3 million diluted tonnes of probable mineral reserves (or approximately 1.7 million diluted tonnes of probable mineral reserves on a 51.5% basis). Average proven and probable mineral reserve grades are 306 g/t silver, 0.35 g/t gold, 2.76% lead and 5.65% zinc. The mineral reserve estimates contained in the Los Gatos Technical Report have an effective date of July 1, 2020 and exclude 655,746 tonnes of mineral reserves that have been mined through June 30, 2020. Subsequent to July 1, 2020, 363,857 tonnes of material have been mined through December 31, 2020, which we believe would not result in a material change to the information contained in the Los Gatos Technical Report.
•
The Los Gatos District, located in Chihuahua, Mexico, is located approximately 120 kilometers south of Chihuahua City and is comprised of a 103,087-hectare land position, constituting a new mining district. The Los Gatos District consists of 14 mineralized zones, which include three identified silver-lead-zinc deposits that contain mineral resources - the CLG, the Esther deposit and the Amapola deposit - as well as 11 additional high-priority targets defined by high-grade drill intersections and over 150 kilometers of outcropping quartz and calcite veins. The area is characterized by a predominant silver-lead-zinc epithermal mineralization. On September 1, 2020, the LGJV commenced concentrate sales at the CLG. A core component of the LGJV’s business plan is to explore the highly prospective, underexplored Los Gatos District with the objective of identifying additional mineral deposits that can be mined and processed, possibly utilizing the CLG plant infrastructure.
2020 Key Highlights
•
Rapid recommissioning of the CLG following Mexico’s mandated COVID-19 project suspension;
•
Strong operational and financial results from the CLG following a 45-day temporary suspension. The CLG was recommissioned in late May 2020 with an optimized plan averaging a production rate of 2,324 tpd in December 2020;
•
Record production from the CLG - 652,739 ore tonnes were mined in 2020;
•
Record silver, gold, zinc and lead metal recoveries at the CLG processing plant by the end of 2020 - silver, gold, zinc and lead recovery exceeded plan at 86.2%, 62.7%, 73.3% and 87.1% respectively, during the fourth quarter;
•
Commencement of a 27,000-meter exploration program at CLG; and
•
Successful completion of an IPO on the NYSE and TSX of 24,644,500 shares, raising gross proceeds of $172,500 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Recent Developments
Initial Public Offering
On October 27, 2020, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 relating to its initial public offering was declared effective by the SEC. Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange on October 28, 2020. On October 30, 2020, we completed our initial public offering of 21,430,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $134,800 thousand, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us. On November 10, 2020, we issued and sold an additional 3,214,500 shares of common stock
at a public offering price of $7.00 per share, pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, resulting in net proceeds of $20,900 thousand, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us.
On October 30, 2020, we effected the Reorganization in which (i) our then-subsidiary Silver Opportunity Partners LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of a newly created Delaware corporation named Silver Opportunity Partners Corporation, (ii) each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization was exchanged for (A) 0.394057448219062 shares of our common stock (subject to rounding to eliminate fractional shares) and (B) 0.105942551780938 shares of common stock of SOP Corporation (subject to rounding to eliminate fractional shares) and (iii) we changed our name from Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation to Gatos Silver, Inc. SOP held our interest in the Sunshine Complex, which is located in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District in Idaho and is comprised of the Sunshine Mine and the Sunshine Big Creek Refinery. Through the Reorganization, we distributed all of our equity interest in SOP to our stockholders immediately prior to the Reorganization. The Reorganization did not have any effect on the stated par value of our common stock. All shares of common stock and options outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization were appropriately adjusted by dividing the number of shares of common stock into which the options are exercisable or convertible by two and multiplying the exercise or conversion price thereof by two.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
In late March 2020, the Mexican government declared a national health emergency due to increasing infection rates from the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to the health emergency declaration, the Mexican government ordered a temporary suspension of all “non-essential” operations nationwide in Mexico, including mining operations, in order to help combat the spread of COVID-19. In response to the order, the LGJV effected a 45-day temporary suspension of all non-essential activities at the CLG site, which reduced the number of employees and contractors at the site and at the Chihuahua corporate office. During the temporary suspension, the LGJV implemented health protocols, allowed most administrative and technical services employees to work remotely, reduced mining and milling, completed project enhancements and finalized a mine plan upon reactivation of mining activities after the temporary suspension.
In late May 2020, the Mexican government designated mining an essential service and allowed mines to resume production, subject to deploying COVID-19 prevention protocols. Our existing COVID-19 protocols exceeded those mandated by the Mexican government and, accordingly, the LGJV reactivated mine development and mining in late May 2020 and hired additional employees. Ore processing resumed in early June 2020 and daily production progressively increased with COVID-19 prevention protocols fully implemented.
The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily affected our financial condition in 2020, in part due to the loss of revenue resulting from the 45-day temporary suspension of all non-essential activities at the LGJV’s CLG site and the expenses associated with the development and implementation of COVID-19 protocols. In addition, as the LGJV reactivated mine development and mining, it implemented a scalable optimized plan with a lower employee complement and with reduced average monthly production rate at 1,750 tpd until September 2020, targeting higher ore grades. In December 2020, the average monthly production rate was at 2,324 tpd.
We are closely monitoring the developments of the outbreak and continually assessing the potential impact on our business. If the Mexican government were to reinstate the suspension order caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or if all mining activities at the CLG site were suspended for an undefined period of time, there could be additional costs incurred, production and development delays, cost overruns and operational restart costs that would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The degree to which the pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and in many cases cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as the efficacy of vaccines (particularly with respect to emerging strains of the virus). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional risks we face due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exploration Drilling Program
In December 2020, the Company and its LGJV partner, Dowa, commenced a 27,000-meter exploration program to convert the CLG’s established 3.2 million tonnes of inferred resources to the measured and indicated category and to discover additional resources along the northwest and southeast extensions of the CLG deposit.
In 2021, the LGJV intends to initiate a second exploration program to expand resources throughout the Los Gatos District. The initial target is an estimated 19,000-meter campaign at the Esther deposit, to expand its initial NI 43-101 compliant indicated resource of 0.46 million tonnes at 133 g/t silver, 2.1% zinc, 0.7% lead and inferred resource of 2.29 million tonnes at 98 g/t silver, 3.0% zinc, and 1.6% lead. Esther is located about four kilometers from Cerro Los Gatos and contains similar styles of mineralization and geochemistry. The Company believes that further drilling may materially expand the size and mineral tenor of this resource.
In March 2021, the Company commenced a 5,400-meter exploration program on its wholly-owned Santa Valeria property. The Santa Valeria target has been developed through regional geologic work by the Company’s exploration team, which defined a large basin structure hosting the mineralization zones within the Los Gatos District. Santa Valeria is geologically comparable to Cerro Los Gatos and may contain similar mineral content.
Components of Results of Operations
Operating Expenses
Exploration Expenses
We conduct exploration activities under mining concessions in Mexico. We expect exploration expenses to increase significantly as we continue to expand our exploration activities at the Los Gatos District and our other exploration properties. Exploration expenses primarily consist of drilling costs, lease concession payments, assay costs and other geological and support costs at exploration properties.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits, stock compensation, professional and consultant fees, insurance and other general administration costs. Our general and administrative expenses are expected to increase significantly as we operate as a public company. We expect higher costs related to salaries, benefits, stock compensation, legal fees, compliance and corporate governance, accounting and audit expenses, stock exchange listing fees, transfer agent and other stockholder-related fees, directors’ and officers’ and other insurance costs, and other administrative costs. We are party to a Management Services Agreement with SOP, pursuant to which we provide certain executive and managerial advisory services to SOP. SOP reimburses us for costs of providing such services.
Equity Loss in Affiliates
Our equity loss in affiliates relates to our proportional share of net loss incurred from the LGJV.
LGJV Arrangement Fee
Our LGJV arrangement fee consists of arrangement fees related to the Term Loan and the WCF. The arrangement fees are based on fixed 2% and 15% rates for the Term Loan and the WCF, respectively, and 70% of the outstanding principal of the respective facility. These arrangement fees are solely our responsibility. On March 11, 2021, the WCF was extinguished and thus we do not expect to incur LGJV arrangement fees in future periods with respect to the WCF but will continue to incur LGJV arrangement fees with respect to the Term Loan as long as such loan remains outstanding.
Income Taxes
As we have incurred substantial losses from our exploration and pre-development activities, we may receive further benefits in the form of deferred tax assets that can reduce our future income tax liabilities, if
it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized before expiration. Historically, we have not recognized these potential benefits in our financial statements and have fully reserved for such net deferred tax assets, as we believe it is more likely than not that the full benefit of these net deferred tax assets will not be realized before expiration.
Royalties
Exploration activities are conducted on the Los Gatos District mining concessions in Mexico. Mineral and concession lease payments are required to be paid to various entities to secure the appropriate claims or surface rights. Certain of these agreements also have royalty payments that were triggered when we began producing and selling metal-bearing concentrate.
Results of Operations
The following table presents certain information relating to our operating results and discontinued SOP operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), these financial results represent the consolidated results of operations of our Company and its subsidiaries (in thousands). See Note 12 - Discontinued Operations in our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Loss from Continuing Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a net loss from continuing operations of $35,027 thousand compared to a net loss of $30,908 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $4,119 thousand increase in net loss from continuing operations was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses. General and administrative expense increased to $7,765 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2,903 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher costs associated with becoming a publicly traded company with higher legal and consulting costs, additional personnel, higher directors fees, increased directors and officers insurance premiums and increased stock-based compensation expense related to the offering.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, other expense decreased to $26,447 thousand from $27,048 thousand, respectively. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to
the $11,231 thousand dilution loss on affiliates in 2019, partially offset by the $4,720 thousand increase in equity loss in affiliates from LGJV operation in 2020, the $1,855 thousand increase in LGJV arrangement fees due to higher average outstanding balances on the WCF that was extinguished March 11, 2021, and $4,047 thousand in non-recurring interest expense associated with the convertible note that was converted to capital stock as part of the IPO.
The LGJV’s increase in operating loss, which is picked up under the equity method of accounting in our financial statements under the item ‘‘Equity loss in affiliates,’’ for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulted primarily from the continued mining and processing activities to ramp-up to design throughput, a full year of depreciation on the assets placed in service, and a full year of interest and arrangement fee expenses. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the LGJV incurred certain fixed costs during the April through May 2020 temporary suspension and the related ramp-up periods, which contributed to the operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Loss from Discontinued Operations
Net loss from discontinued operations decreased to $5,414 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6,910 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our fiscal 2020 results include the SOP operations through October 30, 2020, the effective date of the Reorganization. As a result, the 2020 results reflect only 10 months (83%) of discontinued SOP operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $150,146 thousand and $8,581 thousand, respectively. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to net proceeds from the IPO and from the issuance of the convertible notes, described below, partially offset by increased financing costs and higher administrative costs from being a publicly listed company. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had working capital of $151,728 thousand and $14,990 thousand, respectively. The increase in working capital was primarily due to the higher cash and cash equivalents and an increase in prepaid expenses, partially offset by converting related-party receivables to capital contributions in the LGJV and a decrease in deferred financing costs.
Sources and Uses of Capital Resources
On April 20, 2020, we entered into a convertible note purchase agreement with Electrum Silver US LLC, which was subsequently amended. The outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes and any accrued but unpaid interest was due and payable on April 19, 2023 unless converted into shares of our common stock in a qualified financing. However, any conversion of the convertible notes into equity securities as described above was deemed a repayment of the convertible notes so converted. The convertible notes bore interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum, compounding annually. From April 20, 2020 to September 21, 2020, we issued $15,000 thousand aggregate principal amount of convertible notes. In connection with the closing of the IPO on October 30, 2020, we converted all of the outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes plus $187 thousand in accrued and unpaid interest into an aggregate of 2,712,003 shares of common stock.
On October 30, 2020, we completed our initial public offering of 21,430,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $134,800 thousand, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us. On November 10, 2020, we issued and sold an additional 3,214,500 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share, pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, resulting in net proceeds of $20,900 thousand, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us.
On March 11, 2021, we repurchased an approximate 18.5% interest in the LGJV, increasing our ownership to 70.0% for a total consideration of $71,550 thousand, including a 70% penalty and all costs incurred by Dowa in connection with its ownership of such equity interest, including, but not limited to, legal and accounting fees, capital contributions and taxes. Additionally, we extinguished our 70% share of the $60,000 thousand WCF for $42,000 thousand.
We believe we have sufficient cash and resources to carry out our business plans for at least the next 12 months. We are focused on our forward-looking liquidity needs. We are evaluating our ongoing fixed cost structure as well as decisions related to project retention, advancement and development. We will likely be required to raise capital or take other measures to fund future exploration and development. Significant development activities, if warranted, will require that we arrange for financing in advance of planned expenditures. In addition, we expect to continue to increase our current financial resources with external financings as long as our long-term business needs require us to do so. We manage liquidity risk through the management of our capital structure.
We may be required to provide funds to the LGJV to support operations at the CLG which, depending upon the circumstances, may be in the form of equity, various forms of debt or some combination thereof. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result. Additionally, if we raise additional funds by incurring new debt obligations, the terms of the debt may require significant cash payment obligations, as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.
Indebtedness and Lines of Credit
We had no related party debt as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. We had no outstanding lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. We guaranteed 70.0% of the Term Loan and the WCF as of December 31, 2020. We had certain arrangement fee obligations related to the CLG as detailed in the “LGJV Arrangement Fee” above. As of December 31, 2020, the approximate ownership of the LGJV entities was 51.5% in favor of the Company and 48.5% in favor of Dowa.
Dowa Debt Agreements
Dowa Term Loan
On July 11, 2017, we entered into the Term Loan with the LGJV and Dowa, whereby the LGJV could borrow up to $210,000 thousand to finance the development of the Los Gatos project, with a maturity date of December 29, 2027. Interest accrues daily at LIBOR plus 2.35% per annum, and the interest was added to the amount borrowed until production commenced at the Los Gatos project. The LGJV is obligated to pay 14 consecutive semi-annual payments totaling the aggregate principal amount and capitalized interest beginning June 30, 2021, with payments made two business days prior to the end of each June and December. We guarantee 70.0% of the Term Loan and are required to pay an arrangement fee on the borrowing, calculated as 2% per annum on 70% of the outstanding principal balance, payable in semi-annual installments. The Term Loan contains affirmative and negative covenants reasonably customary for similar facilities, with which the LGJV is in compliance in all material respects as of December 31, 2020.
Los Gatos Working Capital Facility
On May 30, 2019, we entered into the WCF with the LGJV and Dowa, under which Dowa agreed to provide a maximum of $60,000 thousand for the benefit of the LGJV, with a maturity date of June 28, 2021. The interest under the WCF was LIBOR plus 3% per annum and was payable by the LGJV. We guaranteed 70% of this facility and were required to pay an arrangement fee on the borrowing, calculated as 15.0% per annum on 70.0% of the average daily principal amount outstanding during the relevant fiscal quarter. The WCF contained affirmative and negative covenants reasonably customary for similar facilities, with which the LGJV was in compliance in all material respects as of December 31, 2020. The full principal amount of the WCF was drawn down by the LGJV as of September 2019. On March 11, 2021, the WCF was extinguished.
Cash Flows
The following table presents our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Cash used by operating activities was $18,388 thousand and $12,295 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $6,093 thousand increase was primarily due to the net loss, after non-cash adjustments for equity loss in affiliates, stock-based compensation expense and interest expense on convertible notes issued in shares, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses.
Cash used by investing activities was $12,129 thousand and $21,905 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $9,776 thousand decrease was primarily due to the $18,200 thousand investment in the LGJV in 2019 compared to the $12,298 thousand investment in the LGJV in 2020.
Cash provided by financing activities was $172,464 thousand and $39,828 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $132,636 thousand increase reflects the $40,465 thousand in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2019 in certain private placement offerings compared to the $160,436 thousand in proceeds from the sale of common stock in the IPO and the $15,000 thousand in proceeds from the sale of convertible notes in 2020, partially offset by an increase in deferred financing costs in 2020.
Results of LGJV Operations
The following table presents information relating to the LGJV’s financial condition and operating results for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these financial statements represent the combined financial position and results of the LGJV. As of December 31, 2020, our ownership of the LGJV was approximately 51.5%.

COMBINED BALANCE SHEETS
(in thousands)
LOS GATOS JOINT VENTURE
COMBINING STATEMENT OF LOSS
(in thousands)
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the LGJV had current assets of $69,602 thousand and $70,187 thousand, respectively. The decrease in total current assets was primarily due to decreases in trade receivables and inventory, partially offset by an increase in value added tax receivables and other current assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the LGJV had noncurrent assets of $399,816 thousand and $398,733 thousand, respectively. The increase in noncurrent assets was primarily due to additional mine development costs related to further development of the CLG, partially offset by depletion and depreciation.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the LGJV had current liabilities of $139,757 thousand and $57,995 thousand, respectively. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the amounts due within one year under the Term Loan and the WCF becoming current liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and related party payables. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the LGJV had noncurrent liabilities of $206,049 thousand and $302,026 thousand, respectively. The decrease in non-current liabilities was primarily due to the amounts due within one year under the Term Loan and the WCF becoming current liabilities.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the LGJV had a $27,716 thousand net loss compared to a $22,103 thousand net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. The LGJV’s increase in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted primarily from the continued mining and processing activities to ramp-up to design throughput, a full year of depreciation on the assets placed in service, and a full year of interest and arrangement fee expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the LGJV incurred certain fixed costs during the April through May 2020 temporary suspension and the related ramp-up periods, that contributed to the operating loss for the year ended December 31,2020.
The following table presents summarized information relating to the LGJV’s cash flows for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
LOS GATOS JOINT VENTURE
COMBINED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
(in thousands)
Cash provided by (used by) operating activities was $47,872 thousand and $(16,008) thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $63,880 thousand increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the net loss, after non-cash adjustments for depreciation and depletion expense and arrangement fee expense, and a decrease in inventories, partially offset by an increase in VAT receivables.
Cash used by investing activities was $64,436 thousand and $(123,078) thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $58,642 thousand decrease in cash used was primarily due to completion of the initial project construction in 2019 with reduced expenditures for property, plant and equipment and mine development in 2020.
Cash provided by financing activities was $16,938 thousand and $129,157 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $112,219 thousand decrease reflects the $135,000 thousand in borrowings under the Term Loan and WCF and $18,200 thousand in cash capital contributions in 2019 compared to the $18,904 thousand in cash proceeds from related party capital advances and $5,000 in cash capital contributions in 2020.
Contractual Obligations
We entered into commitments with federal and state agencies to lease surface and mineral rights in Mexico related to our exploration activities. These leases are renewable annually.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not, and we currently do not, have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our shareholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability or expense that is being reported. For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Equity Method Investment
We account for our investment in affiliates using the equity method of accounting whereby, after valuing the initial investment, we recognize our proportional share of results of operations of the affiliate in its consolidated financial statements. Equity method investments are reviewed periodically for other-than-temporary decline in value. Our investment in the LGJV is presented as investment in affiliates in the consolidated balance sheet. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment in affiliates and our equity in the LGJV’s net assets is due to value of mineral resources at MPR. We incur certain costs on behalf of the LGJV, primarily related to a project development loan arrangement fee. Our proportional
share of such costs are reported as an investment in affiliate and the residual costs, related to Dowa’s proportional ownership, are reported in the statement of loss.
Mineral Properties and Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets
Mineral property acquisition costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined. Exploration, mineral property evaluation, option payments, related acquisition costs for mineral properties acquired under option agreements, general overhead, administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred. When proven and probable mineral reserves are determined for a property, subsequent development costs on the property are capitalized. If a project were to be put into production, capitalized development costs would be depleted on the units of production basis determined by the proven and probable mineral reserves for that project.
Existing proven and probable mineral reserves and value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable mineral reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of silver and other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during mining, mineral resources processing and treatment and ultimate sale. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration-stage mineral interests are risk-adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected silver and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on LOM plans. No impairment tests have been required during the periods presented.
Various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable mineral reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration-stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable mineral reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineral resources could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.
Income and Mining Taxes
We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in the United States and Mexico. Refer to “- Critical Accounting Policies - Mineral Properties and Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets” above for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date.
Our properties involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal,
state and Mexico tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues, if any, in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Common Stock Valuation
We estimated the fair value of our common stock in 2019, and prior to October 2020, based on resource multiples, discounted cash flows, comparable property values, comparable public company equity values, changes in comparable public company equity values, and a discount for a lack of marketability. Prior to the IPO, based on this market data, the corresponding fair value of our common stock was used in valuing the options and DSUs granted in 2019 and 2020. At and subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of our common stock was based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) permits us, as an “emerging growth company,” to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies. The decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable.
