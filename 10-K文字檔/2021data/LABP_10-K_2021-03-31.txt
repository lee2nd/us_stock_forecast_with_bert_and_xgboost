Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for patients with autoimmune diseases that are the first to target new mechanisms of action, including the LANCL2, NLRX1 and PLXDC2 immunometabolic pathways. Our core expertise is in the development of therapeutic candidates that target novel pathways at the interface of immunity and metabolism. Based on our understanding of the role that a cell’s metabolic pathways have on modulating inflammatory responses, we aim to inhibit these inflammatory responses by changing the metabolic processes in target cells. We leverage our proprietary AI-based precision medicine platform, which we refer to as our LANCE platform, to identify novel therapeutic targets based on predictions of immunometabolic function and create therapeutic candidates to engage those targets in areas of unmet medical need. Through our LANCE platform, we have identified seven novel immunometabolic targets and product candidates to date across 14 indications, including ulcerative colitis, or UC, Crohn’s disease, or CD, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetic neuropathy and type 1 diabetes.
We have completed the induction phase of a Phase 2 clinical trial of our lead product candidate, BT-11, for mild to moderate UC in the United States, Russia and Europe to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BT-11 in UC patients. Data from the induction stage of this Phase 2 trial demonstrated that BT-11 was gut-restricted and well tolerated, with no treatment-related significant adverse events and a similar adverse event profile across placebo and BT-11 groups.
We have a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2017, our operations have focused on developing our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our LANCE platform, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. Since inception, we have raised an aggregate of $70.0 million of gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our preferred stock and convertible promissory notes.
Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $30.1 million and $13.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $55.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•
conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials of BT-11 and NX-13, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials, as needed;
•
pursue regulatory approval of BT-11 and NX-13 for the treatment of UC and CD;
•
leverage our LANCE platform to discover and develop additional product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases;
•
scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities;
•
establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, including BT-11 and NX-13;
•
adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and
•
incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.
On February 3, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in which we issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $16 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $91.2 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions.
Components of our results of operations
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, and include:
•
salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and other related costs for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs and other third parties that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf, as well as CMOs that manufacture drug material for use in our clinical trials and preclinical studies;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees, and related travel expenses;
•
the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supply; and
•
allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We track external development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have a higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we complete our ongoing clinical trials, initiate new clinical trials, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates and prepare regulatory filings for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical development.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of our existing and future clinical trials of our product candidates or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates and any other product candidate we may develop in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number of patients who enroll in each trial;
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the phase of development of the product candidate; and
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.
Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support our expanded infrastructure, including the development of a commercialization infrastructure for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs. We anticipate the additional costs for these services will increase our general and administrative expenses by between $1.0 million and $2.0 million on an annual basis.
Interest expense
Interest expense consists of interest due on our convertible promissory notes that were outstanding during the period prior to the conversion of the notes into Series B convertible preferred stock in August 2019.
Income taxes
Since our inception in January 2017, we have generated cumulative federal and state net operating loss for which we have not recorded any net tax benefit due to uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods.
As of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $43.9 million and state NOLs of $43.9 million that may be available to offset future taxable income. The federal NOLs include $2.1 million available to reduce 100% of future taxable income, which will begin to expire in 2037, if not utilized, and $41.8 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The state NOLs will begin to expire in 2037, if not utilized.
Utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before we can use them. We have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, including our deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net consists of interest income received from marketable securities.
Results of operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses were $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $13.5 million was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial activities for BT-11.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $3.8 million was primarily attributable to increases in patent costs, related legal fees and other outside professional services.
Other Income, net
Other income, net was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other expense, net of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to interest received from marketable securities.
Liquidity and capital resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our research programs and product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase in connection with conducting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future research programs and product candidates, including BT-11 and NX-13, discovering and developing new product candidates using the LANCE precision medicine platform, contracting with CMOs to support preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other sources.
We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through equity financings. As of December 31, 2020, we had $28.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of $55.7 million. We had no indebtedness as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we had $50.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of $25.6 million. We had no indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
On February 3, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in which we issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $16 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $91.2 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions.
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:
Operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $23 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $30.1 million as we incurred expenses associated with research activities for our lead product candidates and incurred general and administrative expenses. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $9.9 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $13.5 million as we incurred expenses associated with research activities for our lead product candidates and incurred general and administrative expenses.
Investing activities
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $14.1 million, consisting of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $40.3 million, consisting primarily of purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities.
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.5 million was related to proceeds from exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 of $59.6 million was related to net proceeds of $51.7 million from the issuance of our Series B convertible preferred stock and $8.0 million from the issuance of our convertible promissory notes that were subsequently converted into Series B convertible preferred stock.
Funding requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of approved drug products, and we do not expect to generate substantial revenue for at least the next few years. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenue will be compromised. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our product candidates, and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available in the near term, if at all.
We believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2023. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical drugs, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, costs and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of BT-11 and NX-13;
•
the costs and results of discovery work using our LANCE precision medicine platform;
•
the scope, progress, costs and results of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any future product candidates we may decide to pursue;
•
the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;
•
the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs we advance them through preclinical and clinical development;
•
the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements; and
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims.
Further, our operating results may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
Our future commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Until such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:
(1)
Amounts in the table reflect payments due for our headquarters in Blacksburg, Virginia under an operating lease agreement that expires in July 2021.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract organizations for clinical trials, preclinical studies, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination following a certain period after notice and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this prospectus, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Research and development expenses
The majority of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our accrued research and development expenses at each consolidated balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each consolidated balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments as necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for share-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 18, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) based on their respective fair values.
The fair value of our stock options has been determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Sholes option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate and (iv) expected dividends. Due to the lack of historical and implied volatility data of our common stock, the expected stock price volatility has been estimated based on the historical volatilities of a specified group of companies in our industry for a period equal to the expected life of the option. We selected companies with comparable characteristics, including enterprise value, risk profiles and position within the industry and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected term of the stock options. The historical volatility data has been computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies.
The expected life of the options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using the simplified method, which is the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term for each option. The risk-free interest rate is based on a zero coupon, United States Treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock option. We have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is zero.
We recognize the grant-date fair value of an award as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which typically corresponds to the vesting period for the award. In certain circumstances the amount of compensation cost recognized is adjusted to be at least equal to the portion of the grant-date value of the award that was vested at the balance sheet date. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and, upon forfeiture of an award prior to vesting, we reverse any previously recognized compensation expense related to that award.
Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our cash is held in interest-bearing money market accounts. Due to the short- term maturities of our cash equivalents and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash equivalents.
Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Recent accounting pronouncements
A description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
Emerging growth company status
We qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or JOBS Act. As an “emerging growth company” we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
•
the option to present only two years of audited consolidated financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this prospectus;
•
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;
•
not being required to comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
•
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
•
exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering. However, if any of the following events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, (ii) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period or (iii) we become a “large accelerated filer,” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. We will be deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” at such time that we (a) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700.0 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, for a period of at least 12 months and (c) have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this prospectus and our periodic reports and proxy statements.
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period.
