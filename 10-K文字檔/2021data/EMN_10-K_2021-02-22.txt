ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is based upon the consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company"), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted ("GAAP") in the United States, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"). All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are to diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. EBIT is the GAAP measure earnings before interest and taxes.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Eastman evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Definite-lived Assets
Properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by Eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review of properties and equipment and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. The Company's assumptions to estimate cash flows in the evaluation of impairment related to long-lived assets are subject to change and impairments may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings.
Goodwill
Goodwill is an asset determined as the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities
acquired in a business combination. Eastman conducts testing of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the Company has determined to be its "components". Components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by Company operating segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities.
A reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company uses an income approach, including some unobservable inputs, and applies a discounted cash flow model in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit. Key assumptions and estimates used in the Company's 2020 goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues and EBIT determined using the Company's annual multi-year strategic plan, the estimated weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), and a projected long-term growth rate. The Company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. However, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the Company's estimates. In addition, the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different estimated fair values of reporting units. The WACC is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. Therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the Company, may have an impact on future calculations of estimated fair value. For additional information, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In second quarter 2020, the decrease in forecasted revenue and EBIT for the tire additives reporting unit (part of the Additives & Functional Products ("AFP") operating segment) reduced the fair value such that the estimated fair value approximated the carrying value. The decrease in forecasted revenue and EBIT for the tire additives reporting unit was primarily the result of weakened demand in transportation markets impacted by COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic ("COVID-19") and increased competitive pricing pressure as a result of global capacity increases.
The Company had $4.5 billion of goodwill as of December 31, 2020. As a result of the goodwill impairment testing performed during fourth quarter 2020, fair values were determined to substantially exceed the carrying values for each reporting unit tested with the exception of the tire additives reporting unit (part of the Additives & Functional Products operating segment as described in "Business" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report) whose fair value continues to approximate its carrying value. Two of the most critical assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of the tire additives reporting unit are the projected long-term growth rate and the WACC. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a 25 basis point decrease in the projected long-term growth rate or a 25 basis point increase in the WACC, and both scenarios independently yielded approximately a $50 million decrease to the estimated fair value for the tire additives reporting unit. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill allocated to the tire additives reporting unit is $725 million. Additional declines in the market conditions or forecasted revenue and EBIT could result in an impairment of goodwill, especially for the tire additives reporting unit.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. The Company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. The estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on projections of revenue and an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant WACC plus a risk premium. The Company had $374 million in indefinite-lived intangible assets at the time of the annual impairment test. There was no impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the tests performed during fourth quarter 2020.
Additional declines in the market conditions or forecasted revenue could result in additional impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. For additional information, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", Note 3, "Properties and Accumulated Depreciation", Note 4, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", and Note 15, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
The Company will continue to monitor both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for any indication of events which might require additional testing before the next annual impairment test and could result in material impairment charges.
Environmental Costs
Eastman recognizes environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company recognizes the minimum undiscounted amount. This undiscounted amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years and the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $257 million to the maximum of $501 million and from the best estimate or minimum of $260 million to the maximum of $487 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts recognized at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
For additional information, see Note 12, "Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Eastman maintains defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. The estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits primarily reflect the Company's assumptions related to discount rates and expected return on plan assets. For the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the Company assumed weighted average discount rates of 2.48 percent and 1.08 percent, respectively, and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 7.29 percent and 4.04 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2020. The Company assumed a weighted average discount rate of 2.38 percent for its other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2020. The estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.
The projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 expense are affected by year-end 2020 assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Company's long-term assumptions in the assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown.
The assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to calculate the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are established each December 31. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Because future health care benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on results of operations. The expected return on plan assets is based upon prior performance and the long-term expected returns in the markets in which the plans invest their funds, primarily in U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income securities, U.S. and non-U.S. public equity securities, private equity, and real estate. Moreover, the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption and on average is expected to approximate the actual return on plan assets. Actual returns will be subject to year-to-year variances and could vary materially from assumptions.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Company calculates service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. This cost approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation or the annual net periodic benefit cost or credit of the plans because the change in the service and interest costs will be offset in the mark-to-market ("MTM") actuarial gain or loss. The MTM gain or loss, as described in the next paragraph, is typically recognized in the fourth quarter of each year or in any other quarters in which an interim remeasurement is triggered.
The Company uses fair value accounting for plan assets. If actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, primarily discount rates and long-term assumptions for asset returns which were used in determining the current year expense, the difference is recognized as part of the MTM net gain or loss in fourth quarter each year, and any other quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. See the calculation of the MTM pension and other post-retirement benefits (gain) loss table below in "NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES - Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Non-Core and Unusual Items Excluded from Earnings".
While changes in obligations do not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirements, attrition rates of employees, and other factors.
For further information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Income Taxes
Amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities on Eastman's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income and domestic and foreign taxes, using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning opportunities. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from management estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and statements of financial position. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, valuation allowances of $393 million and $453 million, respectively, have been provided against the deferred tax assets.
The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and management judgment. Eastman's income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments which could result in additional income tax liabilities and income tax expense. Income tax expense could be materially impacted to the extent the Company prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established, or to the extent payments are required in excess of the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
For further information, see Note 7, "Income Taxes", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures, and the accompanying reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, are presented below in this section and in "Overview", "Results of Operations", "Summary by Operating Segment", "Liquidity and Other Financial Information - Cash Flows", and "Outlook" in this MD&A.
Management discloses non-GAAP financial measures, and the related reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess the Company's and its operating segments' performances, make resource allocation decisions, and evaluate organizational and individual performances in determining certain performance-based compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have definitions under GAAP, and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any non-GAAP financial measure, but to consider such measures alongside the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-Core Items and any Unusual or Non-Recurring Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Earnings
In addition to evaluating Eastman's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows as reported in accordance with GAAP, management also evaluates Company and operating segment performance, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions, excluding the effect of transactions, costs, and losses or gains that do not directly result from Eastman's normal, or "core", business and operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature.
•Non-core transactions, costs, and losses or gains relate to, among other things, cost reductions, growth and profitability improvement initiatives, and other events outside of core business operations, and have included asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, costs of and related to acquisitions, gains and losses from and costs related to dispositions, closure, or shutdowns of businesses or assets, financing transaction costs, and MTM losses or gains for pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
•In 2018 the Company recognized unusual income from insurance in excess of costs for, and in 2017 recognized unusual net costs of, the disruption, repairs, and reconstruction of the Kingsport site's coal gasification operations area resulting from the previously reported October 4, 2017 explosion (the "coal gasification incident"). Management considered the coal gasification incident unusual because of the Company's operational and safety history and the magnitude of the unplanned disruption.
•In 2018 the Company recognized unusual costs and in both 2019 and 2018 unusual net decreases to earnings from adjustments of the net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017, resulting from tax law changes, primarily the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Reform Act"), and related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the transition to an international treasury services center. Management considered these actions and associated costs and income unusual because of the infrequent nature of such changes in tax law and resulting actions and the significant impacts on earnings.
Because non-core, unusual, or non-recurring transactions, costs, and losses or gains may materially affect the Company's, or any particular operating segment's, financial condition or results in a specific period in which they are recognized, management believes it is appropriate to evaluate the financial measures prepared and calculated in accordance with both GAAP and the related non-GAAP financial measures excluding the effect on the Company's results of these non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. In addition to using such measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management evaluates such non-GAAP measures, and believes that investors may also evaluate such measures, because such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's, and its segments', operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and, as a result, provide a better indication of expected future trends.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Adjusted Tax Rate and Provision for Income Taxes
In interim periods, Eastman discloses non-GAAP earnings with an adjusted effective tax rate and a resulting adjusted provision for income taxes using the Company's forecasted tax rate for the full year as of the end of the interim period. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes are equal to the Company's projected full year effective tax rate and provision for income taxes on earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items for completed periods. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes may fluctuate during the year for changes in events and circumstances that change the Company's forecasted annual effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Management discloses this adjusted effective tax rate, and the related reconciliation to the GAAP effective tax rate, to provide investors more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's operational performance on a period-over-period interim basis and on the same basis as management evaluates quarterly financial results to provide a better indication of expected full year results.
Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measure
Eastman regularly evaluates and discloses to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow", which management defines as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less the amount of net capital expenditures (typically the GAAP measure additions to properties and equipment, and in 2018 net of proceeds from property insurance). Such net capital expenditures are generally funded from available cash and, as such, management believes they should be considered in determining free cash flow. Management believes this is an appropriate metric to assess the Company's ability to fund priorities for uses of available cash. The priorities for cash after funding operations include payment of quarterly dividends, repayment of debt, funding targeted growth opportunities, and repurchasing shares. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating financial performance and potential future cash available for various initiatives and assessing organizational performance in determining certain performance-based compensation and because management believes investors and securities analysts often use a similar measure of free cash flow to compare the results, and value, of comparable companies. In addition, Eastman may disclose to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow yield", which management defines as annual free cash flow divided by the Company's market capitalization, and "free cash flow conversion", which management defines as annual free cash flow divided by adjusted net income. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors and securities analysts in comparing cash flow generation with that of peer and other companies.
Non-GAAP Debt Measure
Eastman from time to time evaluates and discloses to investors and securities and credit analysts the non-GAAP debt measure "net debt", which management defines as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities and credit analysts to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating the Company's overall financial position, liquidity, and leverage and because management believes investors, securities analysts, credit analysts and rating agencies, and lenders often use a similar measure to assess and compare companies' relative financial position and liquidity.
Non-GAAP Measures in this Annual Report
The following non-core items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report:
•MTM pension and other postretirement benefit plans gains and losses resulting from the changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets during the period;
•Asset impairments and restructuring charges, including severance costs and site closure or shutdown charges, net, of which asset impairments are non-cash transactions impacting profitability;
•Accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility as part of ongoing site optimization, and
•Early debt extinguishment costs resulting from repayment of borrowings.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following unusual items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report:
•Costs of, and income from insurance for, the coal gasification incident;
•Costs of currency transaction and professional fees resulting from fourth quarter 2017 tax law changes and related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations; and
•Estimated net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and tax impact of related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations and related subsequent adjustments recognized in 2018 and 2019.
As described above, the alternative non-GAAP measures of cash flow, "free cash flow", and of debt, "net debt", are also presented in this Annual Report.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Non-Core and Unusual Items Excluded from Earnings
Below is the calculation of the "Other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net" that are not included in the above non-core item "mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefits loss, net" and that are included in the non-GAAP results.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Below is the calculation of the MTM pension and other post-retirement benefits (gain) loss disclosed above.
(1)Actuarial (loss) gain resulted primarily from the change in discount rates from the prior year and changes in other actuarial assumptions.
For more detail about MTM pension and other postretirement benefit plans net gains and losses, including actual and expected return on plan assets and the components of the net gain or loss, see "Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" above, and Note 10, "Retirement Plans", "Summary of Changes - Actuarial (gain) loss, Actual return on plan assets, and Reserve for third party contributions", and "Summary of Benefit Costs and Other Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income - Mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefits (gain) loss, net" to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
This MD&A includes the effect of the foregoing on the following GAAP financial measures:
•Gross profit,
•Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses,
•Other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net,
•Other (income) charges, net,
•EBIT,
•Provision for income taxes,
•Net earnings attributable to Eastman,
•Diluted EPS, and
•Net cash provided by operating activities.
Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Alternative Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measure
In addition to the non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report and other periodic reports, management occasionally has evaluated and disclosed to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP measure cash provided by or used in operating activities excluding certain non-core, unusual, or non-recurring sources or uses of cash or including cash from or used by activities that are managed as part of core business operations ("adjusted cash provided by or used in operating activities") when analyzing, among other things, business performance, liquidity and financial position, and performance-based compensation. Management has used this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the GAAP measure cash provided by or used in operating activities because it believes it is an appropriate metric to evaluate the cash flows from Eastman's core operations that are available for organic and inorganic growth initiatives and because it allows for a more consistent period-over-period presentation of such amounts. In its evaluation, management generally excludes the impact of certain non-core activities and decisions of management that it considers not core, ongoing components of operations and the decisions to undertake or not to undertake such activities may be made irrespective of the cash generated from operations, and generally includes cash from or used in activities that are managed as operating activities and in business operating decisions. Management has disclosed this non-GAAP measure and the related reconciliation to investors and securities analysts to allow them to better understand and evaluate the information used by management in its decision-making processes and because management believes investors and securities analysts use similar measures to assess Company performance, liquidity, and financial position over multiple periods and to compare these with other companies.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Alternative Non-GAAP Earnings Measures
From time to time, Eastman may also disclose to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP earnings measures "EBIT Margin", "Adjusted EBITDA", "EBITDA Margin", "Return on Invested Capital" (or "ROIC"), and "Adjusted ROIC". Management defines EBIT Margin as the GAAP measure EBIT adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA (net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods. EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for the same periods. Management defines ROIC as net earnings plus interest expense after tax divided by average total borrowings plus average stockholders' equity for the periods presented, each derived from the GAAP measures in the Company's financial statements for the periods presented. Adjusted ROIC is ROIC adjusted to exclude from net earnings the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods. Management believes that EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and ROIC are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of and returns from Eastman's operating businesses, and from time to time uses such measures in internal performance calculations. Further, management understands that investors and securities analysts often use similar measures of EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, ROIC, and Adjusted ROIC to compare the results, returns, and value of the Company with those of peer and other companies.
OVERVIEW
Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. Eastman uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development capabilities, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company's world class technology platforms form the foundation of sustainable growth by differentiated products through significant scale advantages in research and development ("R&D") and advantaged global market access. Differentiated application development converts market complexity into opportunities for growth and accelerates innovation by enabling a deeper understanding of the value of Eastman's products and how they perform within customers' and end-user products. Key areas of application development include thermoplastic conversion, functional films, coatings formulations, rubber additive formulations, adhesives formulations, nonwovens and textiles, animal nutrition, and molecular recycling technologies. The Company engages the market by working directly with customers and downstream users, targeting attractive niche markets, and leveraging disruptive macro trends. Management believes that these elements of the Company's innovation-driven growth model, combined with disciplined portfolio management and balanced capital deployment, will result in consistent, sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow.
The Company generated sales revenue of $8.5 billion and $9.3 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively. EBIT was $741 million and $1.1 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the non-core and unusual items referenced in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures", adjusted EBIT was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices. Sales volume decreased for products serving end-markets negatively impacted by COVID-19, including transportation, building and construction, consumer durables, and textiles end-markets. Lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material prices. Adjusted EBIT decreased due to reduced capacity utilization, lower sales volume, and less favorable product mix, partially offset by the impact of cost reduction actions.
Discussion of sales revenue and EBIT changes is presented in "Results of Operations" and "Summary by Operating Segment" in this MD&A.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net earnings and EPS and adjusted net earnings and EPS were as follows:
The Company generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities in both 2020 and 2019. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion in both 2020 and 2019.
COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic Response and Impact
Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, in March 2020 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued guidelines to mitigate the spread and health consequences of COVID-19. The Company implemented changes to its operations and business practices to follow the guidelines and minimize physical interaction, including using technology to allow employees to work from home when possible and altering production procedures and schedules.
In response to the uncertainties of the impact of COVID-19 (including on overall business and market conditions; Eastman manufacturing sites and distribution, sales, and service facilities closure or reduced availability; and Eastman products market demand weakness and supply chain disruption), management's focus shifted to cash flow, liquidity, and cost management.
As previously reported, as a precautionary measure due to increased financial market volatility resulting from COVID-19, Eastman took certain liquidity actions, including borrowing $400 million under the revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") in first quarter 2020 and $250 million under a new 364-Day Term Loan Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan") in second quarter 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility were repaid in second quarter 2020 and borrowings under the Term Loan were repaid in third quarter 2020. The Company reduced net debt by $656 million excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2020, and its cash balance as of December 31, 2020 was $564 million. See "Liquidity and Other Financial Information" for additional information.
In 2020, capacity utilization was substantially lower due to lower sales volume and the Company's focus on maximizing cash generation by reducing inventories, reducing EBIT approximately $200 million. Cost reduction actions in response to COVID-19, some of which are expected to be structural, included reduced discretionary spending, deferred asset maintenance turnarounds, and adjusted operations to ensure the health and safety of employees and contractors, totaling approximately $150 million in 2020, with approximately 60 percent in "Cost of sales" and approximately 40 percent in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" and "Research and development expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. See "Results of Operations" and "Summary by Operating Segment" in this MD&A for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(6)Intangible asset impairment charges in the AFP segment tire additives business to reduce the carrying values of the Crystex™ and Santoflex™ tradenames to the estimated fair values. The estimated fair values were determined using an income approach, specifically, the relief from royalty method, including some unobservable inputs. The impairments are primarily the result of weakened demand in transportation markets impacted by COVID-19 and increased competitive pricing pressure as a result of global capacity increases.
(7)Intangible asset impairment charge for customer relationships.
(8)Goodwill impairment charge in the crop protection reporting unit resulting from the annual impairment test. In first quarter 2020, the crop protection reporting unit combined with the care chemicals reporting unit as a result of business management realignment.
(9)Severance and related costs as part of business improvement and cost reduction initiatives which were reported in "Other".
(10)Severance in the AM segment due to the closure of an advanced interlayers manufacturing facility in North America as part of ongoing site optimization. In addition, accelerated depreciation of $8 million was recognized in "Cost of sales" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings in 2020 related to the closure of this facility. Management expects total charges of up to $30 million, mostly in "Cost of sales" and in "Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings, continuing through 2021 for the closure of this facility.

Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
Net Interest Expense
2020 Compared to 2019
Net interest expense decreased primarily as a result of prior year repayment of public debt and lower interest rates.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net interest expense decreased $17 million primarily as a result of U.S. dollar to euro cross-currency swaps, reduced debt balances, and lower interest rates.
Early Debt Extinguishment and Other Related Costs
In third quarter 2020, the Company repaid the Term Loan using available cash. The early repayment resulted in a charge of $1 million for early debt extinguishment costs for unamortized issuance costs.
In fourth quarter 2018, the Company sold 3.5% notes due December 2021 in the principal amount of $300 million and 4.5% notes due December 2028 in the principal amount of $500 million. Net proceeds from the notes were $789 million and were used, together with available cash, for the early and full repayment of the 5.5% notes due November 2019 ($250 million principal) and the partial redemption of the 2.7% notes due January 2020 ($550 million principal). Total consideration for these prepayments were $806 million ($800 million total principal and $6 million for the early redemption premiums) and are reported as financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The early repayment resulted in a charge of $7 million for early debt extinguishment costs which was primarily attributable to the early redemption premiums and related unamortized costs. The book value of the redeemed debt was $799 million.
For additional information regarding the early debt extinguishment costs, see Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Provision for Income Taxes
(1)Provision for income taxes for non-core and unusual items is calculated using the tax rate for the jurisdiction where the gains are taxable and the expenses are deductible.
The 2020 effective tax rate includes a $27 million decrease to the provision for income taxes as a result of a decrease in unrecognized tax positions and a $7 million decrease to the provision for income taxes related to adjustments to certain prior year tax returns.
The 2019 effective tax rate includes a $7 million increase to the provision for income taxes resulting from adjustments to the net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act and from outside-U.S. entity reorganizations. The 2019 effective tax rate also includes adjustments to the tax provision to reflect finalization of prior year's income tax returns and an increase to state income taxes related to additional valuation allowance provided against state income tax credits.
The 2018 effective tax rate included a $20 million increase to the provision for income taxes resulting from adjustments to the net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and from outside-U.S. entity reorganizations. These adjustments related to the one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income and changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with tax law changes and outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT
Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. For additional financial and product information for each operating segment, see "Business - Business Segments" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and Note 19, "Segment and Regional Sales Information", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
2020 Compared to 2019
Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower sales volume. Lower selling prices were due to lower raw material prices and competitive activity in animal nutrition, tire additives, and adhesive resins products. The negative impact of COVID-19 on demand resulted in lower sales volume of aviation fluids and coatings and inks additives sold into transportation end-markets resulting in less favorable product mix.
EBIT in 2020 included intangible asset impairment charges of $125 million for tradenames and customer relationships. The impairments were primarily the result of weakened demand in transportation markets impacted by COVID-19 and increased competitive pricing pressure as a result of global capacity increases. 2020 EBIT also included asset impairments and restructuring charges of $10 million for closure of manufacturing facilities in Asia Pacific as part of ongoing site optimization actions and $1 million related to the previously reported plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing facility. EBIT in 2019 included a $45 million goodwill impairment of the crop protection business, an asset impairment charge of $5 million resulting from management's approval of a plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing site, and a $4 million restructuring charge related to a capital project. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to $133 million of lower sales volume and higher manufacturing costs primarily due to lower capacity utilization and reduction of inventory. These higher costs were offset $41 million by cost reduction actions.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2019 Compared to 2018
Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, lower selling prices, and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The lower sales volume was primarily attributed to weaker end-market demand resulting from global trade-related pressures, particularly in transportation markets and other consumer discretionary end markets. Lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material prices, including for care chemicals, and increased competitive pressure in markets for tire additives, animal nutrition, and adhesives resins.
EBIT in 2019 included a $45 million goodwill impairment of the crop protection business, an asset impairment charge of $5 million resulting from management's approval of a plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing site by the end of 2020, and a $4 million restructuring charge related to a capital project. EBIT in 2018 included a goodwill impairment charge related to the crop protection business and coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices of $133 million, lower sales volume of $101 million, and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates of $22 million, partially offset by lower raw material costs of $136 million.
Growth and Cost Initiatives
In 2020, the AFP segment:
•completed a Dimethylethanolamine ("DMAE") manufacturing capacity expansion in China in response to growing demand for sustainable water treatment under stricter regulation. In addition, the Company decided to significantly increase capacity to produce tertiary amines at its Ghent, Belgium, facility to meet growing demand for hand sanitizers and other household cleaning products;
•advanced growth and innovation of Tetrashield™ , resins that enable low-VOC formulations and eliminate energy-intensive manufacturing steps, by working with key customers and other brands through the value chain;
•completed process improvements of Eastoflex amorphous polyolefin ("APO") polymers manufacturing capacity in Longview, Texas to support product line growth and innovation;
•entered into a global customer supply agreement to meet a growing demand for products in the animal nutrition industry, expanding the Company's gut health solutions offerings; and
•as a result of the ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for certain businesses and product lines within the AFP segment, an animal nutrition manufacturing facility and a tire additives manufacturing facility were closed.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2020 Compared to 2019
Sales revenue decreased due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices. The negative impact of COVID-19 on demand resulted in lower sales volume of advanced interlayers products sold into transportation end-markets, partially offset by increased sales volume in the fourth quarter for consumer durables and increased sales volume of certain standard copolyester products used in applications for personal care and wellness and consumables end-markets, resulting in a less favorable product mix. Lower selling prices were primarily attributed to lower raw material prices, particularly for paraxylene used in copolyester products.
EBIT in 2020 included severance charges of $5 million and accelerated depreciation charges of $8 million resulting from the closure of an advanced interlayers manufacturing facility, and asset impairments and restructuring charges of $8 million resulting from the closure of a performance films manufacturing facility, both in North America, as part of ongoing site optimization actions. Excluding these non-core items, EBIT decreased primarily due to $128 million of lower sales volume and higher manufacturing costs due to lower capacity utilization and reduction of inventory. These higher costs were offset $53 million by cost reduction actions and lower raw material and energy costs offsetting lower selling prices by $19 million.
2019 Compared to 2018
Sales revenue decreased due to lower sales volume and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. Increased sales volume of premium products, including paint protection films, Tritan™ copolyester, and Saflex™ acoustic and architectural interlayers, was more than offset by decreased sales volume of standard copolyester and interlayers products related to underlying market declines in transportation and consumer durable end markets.
EBIT in 2019 included a restructuring charge for severance costs. EBIT in 2018 included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs and a charge for an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT increased primarily due to lower raw material costs of $49 million, mostly offset by an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates of $23 million and lower sales volume of $16 million. The impact of lower sales volume was mostly offset by increased sales of certain premium products.
Growth and Cost Initiatives
In 2020, the AM segment:
•commercialized polyester renewal technology with multiple products in various markets including the adoption of Tritan™ Renew in durable goods end-markets;
•commercialized carbon renewal technology with multiple products in various markets including the adoption of Acetate Renew in the premium eyewear end-market;
•continued circular economy advancements (including the January 2021 announced methanolysis advanced plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling manufacturing facility);
•continued the growth of Tritan™ copolyester in the durable goods and health and wellness markets, supported by continued market and application development;
•continued to expand portfolio of differentiated next generation products for both automotive and architectural interlayer films products;
•developed and launched Eastman CORE (trademark and patent pending) digital product data analytics software for accessory sales management and installation of automotive window and paint protection films products; and
•as part of ongoing site optimization, a performance films manufacturing facility and an advanced interlayers manufacturing facility in North America were closed.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2020 Compared to 2019
Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices across the segment attributed to lower raw material prices, and lower sales volume in most product lines attributed to the negative impact of COVID-19 on demand and increased competitive pressure.
EBIT in 2020 included severance charges and EBIT in 2019 included an asset impairment charge both related to the previously reported plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing facility. Excluding these non-core items, EBIT decreased due to $66 million of lower sales volume and higher manufacturing costs due to lower capacity utilization, and lower selling prices partially offset by lower raw material and energy costs, totaling $17 million. The higher manufacturing costs were offset by $38 million of cost reduction actions and $18 million of technology licensing earnings in 2020.
2019 Compared to 2018
Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices across the segment attributed to lower raw material prices and increased competitive activity. Sales revenue was also negatively impacted by lower functional amines products sales volume attributed to weaker demand in agricultural end-markets resulting from wet weather in North America and lower intermediates products sales volume attributed to increased competitive activity.
EBIT in 2019 included an asset impairment charge resulting from management's approval of a plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing site by the end of 2020. EBIT in 2018 included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs of $63 million and lower sales volumes of $9 million.
Growth and Cost Initiatives
To maintain and enhance its status as a low-cost producer and optimize earnings, the CI segment continuously focuses on cost control, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization. This includes focusing on products used internally by other operating segments, thereby supporting growth in specialty product lines throughout the Company, and also external licensing opportunities.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In 2020, the CI segment announced a strategic project for site optimization and recognized revenue and earnings from licensing of innovative technologies. Under a site optimization project with Gulf Coast Ammonia ("GCA") and Air Products, Inc., GCA leases a portion of Eastman's Texas City, Texas site and will build and own a new world-scale ammonia production plant. In 2018, the Company and Johnson Matthey announced that Eastman's proprietary technology for the production of mono ethylene glycol ("MEG") from coal had been selected by Inner Mongolia Jiutai New Material (Jiutai) for its planned 1,000,000 tonnes per annum ethylene glycol facility. The Company recognized revenue and earnings from the MEG technology license in 2020. In addition, production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing site discontinued as of December 31, 2020 with the site to be shut down in 2021.
2020 Compared to 2019
Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower textile products sales volume attributed to the impact of COVID-19 on demand and lower acetate tow selling prices primarily due to previously negotiated multi-year contracts.
EBIT decreased primarily due to $26 million of lower sales volume and higher manufacturing costs due to lower capacity utilization and reduction of inventory. These higher costs were offset $10 million by cost reduction actions.
2019 Compared to 2018
Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower acetate tow sales volume attributed to weakened market demand resulting from general market decline and customer buying patterns.
EBIT included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs in 2018. Excluding this unusual item, EBIT decreased primarily due to lower acetate tow sales volume of $24 million.
Growth and Cost Initiatives
The Fibers segment R&D efforts focus on serving existing customers, leveraging proprietary cellulose ester and spinning technology for differentiated application development in new markets, optimizing asset productivity, and working with suppliers to reduce costs. For acetate tow, these efforts are assisting customers in the effective use of the Fibers segment's products and customers' product development efforts. For other products, management is applying the Company's innovation-driven growth model to leverage its fibers technology and expertise to focus on innovative growth in the textiles and nonwovens markets. Examples of recent product innovation within the Fibers segment include Naia™ yarn for the apparel market developed from Eastman's proprietary cellulose ester technology; and Vestera™ wood pulp-based alternative for the nonwoven industry used in personal hygiene applications.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In 2019 the Company acquired Industrias del Acetato de Celulosa. S.A. ("INACSA"), a cellulosic yarn business in LA Batllòria, Spain as a targeted addition to the Fibers segment's acetate yarn business.
Costs related to growth initiatives, R&D costs, certain components of pension and other postretirement benefits, and other expenses and income not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in operating segment results for any of the periods presented and are included in "Other". In 2020, the Company recognized charges of $61 million for severance and related costs as part of business improvement and cost reduction initiatives, $4 million, for contract termination fees, and $8 million for asset impairments resulting from management's decision to discontinue certain growth initiatives for polyester based microfibers, including Avra™ performance fibers. In 2019, the Company recognized charges of $49 million for severance and related restructuring costs. In 2018, the Company recognized charges of $6 million for severance.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
SALES BY CUSTOMER LOCATION
2020 Compared to 2019
Sales revenue in United States and Canada decreased primarily due to lower selling prices in all operating segments and lower sales volume in the CI and AM segments. These items were partially offset by higher sales volume in the Fibers and AFP segments.
Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices in all operating segments. These items were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rates in all operating segments.
Sales revenue in Asia Pacific decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower sales volume in all operating segments.
Sales revenue in Latin America decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices in all operating segments.
2019 Compared to 2018
Sales revenue in United States and Canada decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower sales volume in all operating segments, particularly in the CI and AFP segments.
Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in all operating segments, lower AFP segment selling prices, and lower AFP and CI segments sales volume. These items were partially offset by higher sales volume in the AM segment.
Sales revenue in Asia Pacific decreased primarily due to lower sales volume in all operating segments, particularly in the AFP and AM segments, and lower CI and AFP segments selling prices.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
LIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
COVID-19 Liquidity Actions
Priorities for uses of available cash for full year 2020 included payment of the quarterly dividend and the reduction of net debt. In first quarter and second quarter 2020, as a precautionary measure due to increased financial market volatility resulting from COVID-19, the Company took certain liquidity actions, including borrowing $400 million under its existing Credit Facility and $250 million under a new Term Loan. Borrowings under the Credit Facility were repaid in second quarter 2020 and borrowings under the Term Loan were repaid in third quarter 2020. As previously reported, in second quarter 2020, the Company amended the covenants of both loan agreements to reflect higher cash balances to enhance liquidity and the expected negative impact on operating results of COVID-19.
Cash Flows
The Company had cash and cash equivalents as follows:
Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Risk Factors" in this MD&A. Management believes maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategy and financial flexibility.
2020 Compared to 2019
Cash provided by operating activities decreased $49 million due to lower net earnings, partially offset by lower net working capital (trade receivables, inventories, and trade payables), primarily due to a decrease in inventories.
Cash used in investing activities decreased $86 million due to lower additions to properties and equipment. Additionally, there were acquisitions in the AFP and Fibers business segments in 2019.
Cash used in financing activities decreased $339 million due to lower share repurchases and lower debt repayments.
2019 Compared to 2018
Cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to lower net earnings, partially offset by lower net working capital (trade receivables, inventories, and trade payables).
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Cash used in investing activities increased $17 million. Proceeds from coal gasification incident insurance for property damage of $65 million was included in 2018. Excluding this item, cash used in investing activities decreased $48 million due to lower capital expenditures partially offset by acquisitions of businesses in the AFP and Fibers segments. Lower capital expenditures were due to significant capital projects related to key growth initiatives being completed and put into service during 2018.
Cash used in financing activities was relatively unchanged with increased net debt repayments and dividend payments offset by lower share repurchases.
(1)Cash proceeds from insurance for coal gasification incident property damage.
Working Capital Management and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
Eastman applies a proactive and disciplined approach to working capital management to optimize cash flow and to enable a full range of capital allocation options in support of the Company's strategy. Eastman expects to continue utilizing the programs described below to support free cash flow consistent with our past practices.
The Company has an off balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring program under which entire invoices may be sold, without recourse, to third-party financial institutions. Available capacity under these agreements, which the Company uses as a routine source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. The total amount of receivables sold in 2020 and 2019 were $1.5 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Based on the original terms of receivables sold for certain agreements and actual outstanding balance of receivables under service agreements, the Company estimates that $150 million and $169 million of these receivables would have been outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, had they not been sold under these factoring agreements.
Eastman works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working
capital and cash flows. As part of these efforts, in 2019 the Company introduced a voluntary supply chain finance program to
provide suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from Eastman to a participating financial institution. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding both programs.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Debt and Other Commitments
At December 31, 2020, Eastman's borrowings totaled approximately $5.6 billion with various maturities. In October 2020, the Company repaid the 4.5% notes due January 2021 ($185 million principal) using available cash. In fourth quarter 2019, the Company repaid the 2.7% notes due January 2020 ($250 million principal) using available cash. For information about debt and related interest, see Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
For information about purchase obligations and operating leases, see Note 11, "Leases and Other Commitments", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Amounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental loss contingency estimates, accrued compensation benefits, uncertain tax liabilities, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the "2026 and beyond" line item.
The amount and timing of pension and other postretirement benefit payments included in other liabilities is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans' funded status above 80 percent under the funding provisions of the Pension Protection Act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment. The Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans are not currently under any benefit restrictions. See Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, for more information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
The resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters included in other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for the Company's accounting policy for environmental costs, and see Note 12, "Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding outstanding environmental matters and asset retirement obligations.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Loan Agreement, Credit Facility, and Commercial Paper Borrowings
In second quarter 2020, the Company borrowed $250 million under a new Term Loan as a precautionary measure due to increased financial market volatility, particularly in the availability and terms of commercial paper, resulting from COVID-19. In third quarter 2020, the Term Loan was repaid using available cash. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
The Company has access to a $1.50 billion Credit Facility expiring October 2023. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. The Credit Facility provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes and supports commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings are classified as short-term. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, commercial paper borrowings were $50 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25 percent. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, that determine the events of default, amounts available, and terms of borrowings. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. As previously reported, in second quarter 2020 the Company amended the Credit Facility and the Term Loan maximum debt covenants to reflect the higher cash balance to enhance liquidity due to, and the expected negative impact on operating results of, COVID-19 and added a new restrictive covenant prohibiting stock repurchases until June 30, 2021 in the event certain financial ratios are exceeded. See the Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 6, 2020 for additional information on the amendments to the Credit Facility and the Term Loan. The total amount of available borrowings under the Credit Facility was approximately $1.50 billion as of December 31, 2020.
In second quarter 2020, management made the decision not to renew the Company's $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement, determining other available sources of liquidity sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Net Debt
(1)Includes a non-cash increase of $132 million in 2020 and a non-cash decrease of $25 million in 2019 resulting from foreign currency exchange rates.
In 2020 the Company reduced net debt by $656 million excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures were $383 million, $425 million, and $528 million ($463 million net of proceeds from property damage insurance for 2017 coal gasification incident) in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2020 were primarily for targeted growth initiatives and site modernization projects.
The Company expects that 2021 capital spending will be between $500 million and $525 million, primarily for targeted growth initiatives, including the AM segment methanolysis plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee, and global site modernization projects.
The Company had capital expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement of approximately $42 million, $27 million, and $44 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company does not currently expect near term environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially impact the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 7,887,216 shares have been repurchased under the February 2018 authorization for a total amount of $633 million. During 2020, the Company repurchased a total of 1,134,052 shares for a total cost of approximately $60 million.
The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.69 per share during the first quarter of 2021, payable on April 5, 2021 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2021.
INFLATION
In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastman's costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although derivative financial instruments are utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market price fluctuations. Management expects the volatility of raw material and energy prices and costs to continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects. For additional information, see Note 9, "Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
For information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to Eastman's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OUTLOOK
In 2021, management expects adjusted EPS to increase between 20 and 30 percent compared with 2020 and free cash flow to be greater than $1 billion. These expectations assume:
•economic activity recovering from the impact of COVID-19;
•cost structure to be similar to 2020 due to structural cost savings from transformation of businesses and operations;
•lower costs of approximately $100 million from improved capacity utilization in 2021 due to aggressive inventory actions in 2020;
•increased sales volume and improved product mix due to innovation-driven growth model and continued recovery in key end-markets, including auto, textiles, and durables;
•timing of price increases in response to higher raw material, energy, and logistics costs and continued competitive pressure in markets for tire additives and adhesives resins products to negatively impact financial results;
•interest expense of approximately $200 million;
•the full-year effective tax rate on adjusted earnings before income tax to be between 15 and 16 percent;
•depreciation and amortization of approximately $570 million; and
•capital expenditures between $500 million and $525 million.
In addition, the Company expects net debt reduction of approximately $300 million.
The Company's 2021 financial results forecasts do not include non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Accordingly, management is unable to reconcile projected full-year 2021 earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items to projected reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts.
See "Risk Factors" below.
RISK FACTORS
In addition to factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the material known factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those under "Outlook" and in the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time. See "Forward-Looking Statements". The following risk factors are not necessarily presented in the order of importance. In addition, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. This and other related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects.
Risks Related to Global Economy and Industry Conditions
Continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company.
The Company's business and operating results were impacted by the last global recession, and its related impacts, such as the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that impacted the global economy. Similarly, as a company which operates and sells products worldwide, continued uncertainty in the global economy and global capital markets resulting from the current global COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact demand for certain Eastman products and, accordingly results of operations, and may adversely impact the Company's financial condition and cash flows and ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms and negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely impact the Company's financial results.
Eastman is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. These risk mitigation measures do not eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations and may limit the Company from fully benefiting from lower raw material costs and, conversely, offset the impact of higher raw material costs. In addition, the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to continue to impact, and natural disasters, plant interruptions, supply chain disruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation and supply chain infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities could adversely impact, both the cost and availability of these commodities.
The Company's substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in other countries, including U.S. and non-U.S. trade relations, which could adversely impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations.
More than half of Eastman's sales for 2020 were to customers outside of North America. The Company expects sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales. Also, a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, the Company's business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements, and economic conditions of many jurisdictions including the unique geographic impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact product demand and may adversely impact the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, the U.S. and foreign countries have imposed and may impose additional taxes or otherwise tax Eastman's foreign income (see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Income Taxes" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report), or adopt or increase restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, tariffs or other taxes, or limitations on imports or exports (including recent and proposed changes in U.S. trade policy and resulting retaliatory actions by other countries, including China, which have recently reduced and which may increasingly reduce demand for and increase costs of impacted products or result in U.S.-based trade counterparties limiting trade with U.S.-based companies or non-U.S. customers limiting their purchases from U.S.-based companies). Certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Eastman's global scope. For example, it may be more difficult for Eastman to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems, and the laws of some countries may not protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Eastman's intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in loss of valuable proprietary information. There is also risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Eastman operates. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Eastman's corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions (including the U.K. departure from the European Union, also known as "Brexit") in countries where Eastman operates are a risk to the Company's financial performance. As Eastman continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse impact on Eastman's business, financial condition, or results of operations.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Risks Related to the Company's Business and Strategy
The Company's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing businesses, including cybersecurity risks, any of which could disrupt manufacturing operations or related infrastructure and adversely impact results of operations.
As a global specialty materials company, Eastman's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling, and transportation, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation and supply chain interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. Significant limitation on the Company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the Company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, credit ratings, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as supply chain disruption, computer or equipment malfunction at third-party service providers, natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation and supply chain infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. The Company has in the past experienced cyber attacks and breaches of its computer information systems, although none of these have had a material adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial results. While the Company remains committed to managing cyber related risk, no assurances can be provided that any future disruptions due to these, or other, circumstances will not have a material impact on operations (see "Business - Eastman Chemical Company General Information - Information Security" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report). Unplanned disruptions of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors, and the environment, and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. As previously reported, manufacturing operations and earnings were previously negatively impacted by the second quarter 2018 third-party supplier operational disruptions at the Texas City and Longview, Texas manufacturing facilities.
Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require significant resources in addition to or different from those available or in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives.
Eastman continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both organic and inorganic initiatives. These growth opportunities include development and commercialization or licensing of innovative new products and technologies and related employee leadership, expertise, skill development and retention, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. Such initiatives are necessarily constrained by availability and development of additional resources, including development, attraction, and retention of employee leadership, application development, and sales and marketing talent and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such innovation, development and commercialization or licensing efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses) will receive necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, or result in financially successful commercialization of products, or acceptance by existing or new customers, or successful entry into new markets or otherwise achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company's results of operations. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively impact the returns from any proposed or current investments and projects.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Significant acquisitions expose the Company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.
While acquisitions have been and continue to be a part of Eastman's growth strategy, acquisitions of large companies and businesses (such as the previous acquisitions of Taminco Corporation and Solutia, Inc.) subject the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These include, but are not limited to, the possibilities that the actual and projected future financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected and that, as reported in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report, the carrying values of certain assets from acquisitions may, as has been the case for certain acquired assets primarily in the AFP segment, be impaired resulting in charges to future earnings; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the Company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the Company's existing businesses; and that the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into Eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.
Risks Related to Regulatory Changes and Compliance
Legislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions could increase the Company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs.
Eastman, its facilities, and its businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws, regulations, and related voluntary actions, both in the U.S. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws, regulations, and voluntary actions. The Company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. For example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and actions, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Specifically, future changes in legislation and regulation and related voluntary actions associated with physical impacts of climate change may increase the likelihood that the Company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by carbon requirements, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy policy, and may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs. See "Business - Eastman Chemical Company General Information - Compliance With Environmental and Other Government Regulations" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.
