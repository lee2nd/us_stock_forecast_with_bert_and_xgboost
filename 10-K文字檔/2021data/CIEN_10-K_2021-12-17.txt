Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.
Overview
We are a networking systems, services and software company, providing solutions that enable a wide range of network operators to deploy and manage next-generation networks that deliver services to businesses and consumers. We provide hardware, software and services that enable the transport, routing, switching, aggregation, service delivery and management of video, data and voice traffic on communications networks. Our solutions are used by communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators, Web-scale providers, submarine network operators, governments, enterprises, research and education institutions and emerging network operators.
Our portfolio is designed to enable what we refer to as the Adaptive Network™, our vision for a network end state that emphasizes a programmable and scalable network infrastructure, software control and automation capabilities, network analytics and intelligence, and related advanced services. By transforming network infrastructures into a dynamic, programmable environment driven by automation and analytics, network operators can realize greater business agility, dynamically adapt to changing end-user service demands and rapidly introduce new revenue-generating services. They can also gain valuable real-time network insights, allowing them to optimize network operation and maximize the return on their network infrastructure investment.
Our solutions include Networking Platforms, including our Converged Packet Optical and Routing and Switching portfolios, which can be applied from the network core to end-user access points, and which allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic efficiently and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. Our Converged Packet Optical portfolio includes products that support the connection of content to content, including in long haul and regional, submarine and data center interconnect networks, and users to content, including in metro and edge networks. Our Routing and Switching portfolio includes products and solutions that enable efficient IP transport in next-generation metro edge, access and aggregation networks, connecting users to content in applications that include 5G and Internet of Things, mobile backhaul, optical access, virtualization and enterprise services.
To complement our Networking Platforms, we offer Platform Software, which includes a wide array of software solutions that deliver operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (“OAM&P”) functionality, as well as domain control, orchestration, operational support systems (“OSS”) and service assurance to achieve closed loop automation across multi-vendor and multi-domain network environments. Through our Blue Planet® Software suite, we enable customers to accelerate the digital transformation of their networks through service lifecycle automation.
In addition to our systems and software, we also offer a broad range of services that help our customers build, operate and improve their networks and associated operational environments. These include network transformation, consulting, implementation, systems integration, maintenance, network operations center (“NOC”) management, and optimization services.
Supply Chain Constraints
Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply market for certain raw materials and components, including, in particular, the semiconductor components used in most of our products, has experienced significant disruption in recent periods. These conditions, which worsened during the second half of fiscal 2021, have been exacerbated in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we have experienced ongoing component shortages, longer lead times and increased cost of components, particularly relating to semiconductors. Some of our suppliers have indicated that, as a result of current constraints, they intend to cease manufacturing of certain components used in our products. These conditions have impacted the lead times for our products, and could adversely impact our ability to meet customer demand where we cannot timely secure supply of these components. In response, we have implemented mitigation strategies and increased our purchases of inventory for certain components. In some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended our purchase commitments or placed non-cancellable orders with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions are inaccurate.
We expect these constrained supply conditions to increase our costs of goods sold and to adversely impact our ability to continue to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. The current supply conditions can also be expected to adversely impact our gross margin as well as the level and timing of our revenue during fiscal 2022. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our business and financial results will persist, at least through
the first half of calendar 2022, and may extend into periods thereafter. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report for further discussion of risks related to our supply chain.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business and Operations
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our employees and business partners, while continuing to support the needs of our customers and communities during this unprecedented period. We have also implemented business continuity plans designed to minimize potential business disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect our supply chain and customer fulfillment and support operations. During fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect our business operations, including as set forth below.
Demand for Products & Services. The demand environment for our products and services remains dynamic and continues to be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we experienced a constrained spending environment during the second half of fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021 that adversely impacted our revenue during that period. During the remainder of fiscal 2021, we experienced significantly stronger order volumes for our products and services, particularly among a concentrated set of larger customers with which we have existing positions as a supplier. This improved demand environment and growth in order volumes contributed to our increased revenue in the second half of fiscal 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal 2021. We believe some portion of these orders reflects certain short-term customer purchasing behaviors, including network operators addressing capacity and network requirements following a period of constrained spending in previous quarters, and possible acceleration of future orders due to the implementation of security of supply strategies amidst global supply constraints for semiconductor components. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that the increased demands placed on network infrastructures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related increase in remote working worldwide, have accelerated certain trends, including cloud network adoption, networking resilience and flexibility, and enhanced network automation.
Services and Customer Fulfillment. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, we experienced some disruption in our ability to provide installation, professional and fulfillment services to customers due to site readiness and access limitations, limited customer availability, project delays or re-prioritization by customers, and travel bans or restrictions on movement or gatherings. We have also experienced some disruption and delays in our supply chain operations and logistics, including shipping delays and higher transport costs. The duration and severity of conditions in the future is uncertain and, as a result, may continue to adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.
Sales & Marketing. Restrictions on travel due to COVID-19 and limitations on interactions with customers, such as field and lab trials, have continued to negatively impact our ability to carry out certain sales and marketing activities, including our ability to secure new customers, to qualify and sell new products, and to grow sales with customers. Customer delays in operationalizing new network projects during fiscal 2021 that we anticipated occurring on their original timelines adversely affected our revenue. Conversely, our recent gross margin performance during fiscal 2021 benefited from these dynamics, with a larger percentage of our revenue comprised of existing business, as compared to new design wins and early in life projects, which tend to have lower margins.
Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”). In April 2020, the government of Canada introduced the CEWS program to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, retroactive to March 15, 2020. Amounts from the CEWS program positively impacted our operating expense and measures of profit for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021. For the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021, we recorded CEWS benefits of CAD$52.2 million ($41.3 million), net of certain fees, related to claim periods beginning March 15, 2020, including CAD$43.9 million ($35.4 million) related to employee wages from fiscal 2020. The CEWS program has expired and we do not anticipate a similar impact on our financial results in future periods. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information.
The COVID-19 pandemic and countermeasures taken to contain its spread have caused economic and financial disruptions globally. We continue to monitor the situation and actively assess further implications for our business, supply chain, fulfillment operations and customer demand. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact remain dynamic. Variants continue to emerge, efforts to mitigate or contain the impacts of the pandemic continue to evolve, and the duration and severity of the impact of the pandemic on our business and results of operations in future periods remain uncertain. If the COVID-19 pandemic or its adverse effects become more severe or prevalent or are prolonged in the locations where we, our customers, suppliers or manufacturers conduct business, or we experience more pronounced disruptions in our business or operations, or in economic activity and demand for our products and services generally, our business and results of operations in future periods could be materially adversely affected.
Supply Chain and Distribution Structure; Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset in Fiscal 2021
To better accommodate the requirements of a global business, we are implementing a plan to reorganize our global supply chain and distribution structure more substantially, which includes a legal entity reorganization and related system upgrade. We completed the first phase of this plan in fiscal 2021, and expect to continue to implement the plan during the first half of fiscal 2022. As part of this reorganization, we completed an internal transfer of certain of our non-U.S. intangible assets, which created amortizable tax basis resulting in the discrete recognition of $119.3 million as a deferred tax asset with a corresponding tax benefit. The impact of this transfer is reflected in our effective tax rate for the year ended October 30, 2021, and had a significant, one-time impact on our net income for the period.
Market Opportunity
The markets in which we sell our communications networking solutions are dynamic and are characterized by a high rate of change, including rapid growth in bandwidth demand and network traffic, the proliferation of cloud-based services and new approaches, or “consumption models,” for designing and procuring networking solutions. Emerging services and applications, including 5G mobile communications, Fiber Deep and the Internet of Things, are further impacting or expected to impact wireline network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to provide the quality of experience demanded by end users. Many network operators are under pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets, as they cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. To address these growing service demands and manage network cost, many network operators are looking to adopt next-generation infrastructures that are more programmable and better capable of leveraging data for network insight, analytics and automation. Other network operators are pursuing a diverse range of consumption models in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. Our Adaptive Network vision and our business strategy to capitalize on these changing market dynamics include the initiatives set forth in the “Strategy” section of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part 1 of this annual report.
Business Diversification
A key element of our strategy is to continue to diversify our solutions offerings, customer base and geographic reach to address fast-growing applications and markets. We believe that the continued diversification of our business is important to address the dynamic industry environment in which we operate, to grow our business, and to withstand potential slowdowns adversely affecting particular geographies, markets or customer segments. We believe this diversification has allowed us to maintain a greater degree of stability, to remain resilient and to continue to grow our business despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on any particular geography, segment or customer account.
Investment in Technology Innovation
We are focused on growing our optical and packet infrastructure business by addressing fast-growing markets and applications, including data center interconnection, packet aggregation and routing and submarine networks. In fiscal 2021, we brought to market our footprint-optimized WaveLogic 5 Nano 100G-400G coherent pluggable transceivers. We are also developing Routing and Switching solutions with enhanced IP/Ethernet capabilities to expand our addressable market into additional next generation metro and access applications including packet routing, aggregation and switching, 5G cross-haul, Fiber Deep, and edge computing. In fiscal 2021, we also added several new routing platforms to support the demands of mobile xHaul (fronthaul, midhaul and backhaul) transport. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired AT&T’s Vyatta virtual routing and switching technology, which is intended to expand and accelerate our Adaptive IP solutions and address the growing market opportunity to transform the edge, including 5G networks and cloud environments. See Note 28 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for more information on this acquisition and the related accounting.
Fiscal Year-End Backlog
Generally, we make sales pursuant to purchase orders placed by customers under framework agreements that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale of our products and services. These agreements do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed order quantities. Moreover, we are periodically awarded business for new network opportunities or network upgrades following a selection process. In calculating backlog, we only include (i) customer purchase orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed; and (ii) customer orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed, but are awaiting customer acceptance under the applicable contract terms. Generally, our customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services, although instances of both cancellation and non-acceptance are rare. Backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt of a purchase order, or in the case of certain service obligations, may relate to multi-year support period. As a result, backlog should not necessarily be viewed as an accurate indicator of future revenue for any particular period.
Our backlog was $2.17 billion as of October 30, 2021 as compared to $1.19 billion as of October 31, 2020. Backlog includes product and service orders from commercial and government customers combined, and our significant annual growth reflects the demand dynamics described above. Backlog at October 30, 2021 includes approximately $241.7 million primarily related to orders for products and maintenance and support services that are not expected to be filled or performed within fiscal 2022. Because backlog can be defined in different ways by different companies, our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with figures presented by other companies in our industry.
Consolidated Results of Operations
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. A discussion of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on December 18, 2020 (our “2020 Annual Report”), which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.ciena.com.
Operating Segments
Our results of operations are presented based on the following operating segments: (i) Networking Platforms; (ii) Platform Software and Services; (iii) Blue Planet Automation Software and Services; and (iv) Global Services. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2021, we renamed our “Packet Networking” product line “Routing and Switching.” This change was made on a prospective basis and does not impact comparability of previous financial results or the composition of this product line. References to our “Packet Networking” product line in prior periods have been changed to “Routing and Switching” in this report. See Notes 2 and 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information on our segment reporting.
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
Revenue
Currency Fluctuations
During fiscal 2021, approximately 16.4% of our revenue was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, primarily including sales in Euros, Canadian Dollars, Brazilian Reais, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and Indian Rupee. During fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, the U.S. Dollar primarily weakened against these and other currencies. Consequently, our revenue reported in U.S. Dollars slightly increased by approximately $21.8 million, or 0.6%, as compared to fiscal 2020.
Operating Segment Revenue
The table below sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):
_________________________________
* Denotes % of total revenue
** Denotes % change from 2020 to 2021
•Networking Platforms segment revenue increased, reflecting product line sales increases of $5.9 million of our Converged Packet Optical products and $4.4 million of our Routing and Switching products.
◦Converged Packet Optical sales increased, primarily reflecting sales increases of $88.4 million of our Waveserver® products and $45.6 million of our 6500 Reconfigurable Line System (RLS), primarily to communication service providers. These sales increases were partially offset primarily by sales decreases of $75.7 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform primarily to enterprise customers and communication service providers and $40.2 million of our 5400 family of Packet-Optical Platforms primarily to communications service providers.
◦Routing and Switching sales increased, primarily reflecting sales increases of $10.9 million of our platform independent software and $8.1 million of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches to communication service providers. These increases were partially offset by a sales decrease of $12.5 million of our 8700 Packetwave Platform primarily to government customers.
•Platform Software and Services segment revenue increased, reflecting an increase of $33.2 million in services, primarily to communication service providers. This sales increase was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in software sales. The software sales decrease was primarily due to declines in sales of $4.0 million of our OneControl Unified Management System software and $2.9 million of our other legacy software solutions, partially offset by increased sales of $5.1 million of our MCP software platform. We continue to pursue further customer adoption of our MCP software platform and its enhanced features and functionality. As we transition existing customers as well as features and functionality from our legacy software to this platform, we expect revenue declines for our legacy software solutions within this segment.
•Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment revenue increased, reflecting increases of $9.0 million of software and $5.6 million in software services.
•Global Services segment revenue increased, primarily reflecting sales increases of $19.5 million of our installation and deployment services and $14.0 million of our maintenance support and training, partially offset by a sales decrease of $1.6 million of our consulting and network design services.
Revenue by Geographic Region
Our operating segments engage in business and operations across three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific, Japan and India (“APAC”). The geographic distribution of our revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the timing of revenue recognition for large network projects, particularly outside of the United States, can result in large variations in geographic revenue results in any particular period. The increase in our EMEA region revenue for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by increased sales in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. The increase in our Americas region revenue for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by increased sales in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The decrease in our APAC region revenue for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by decreased sales in Japan, Singapore and Australia, partially offset by increased sales in India. The following table reflects our geographic distribution of revenue, which is principally based on the relevant location for our delivery of products and performance of services. Our revenue, when considered by geographic distribution, can fluctuate significantly, and the timing of revenue recognition for large network projects, particularly outside of the United States, can result in large variations in geographic revenue results in any particular period. The table below sets forth the changes in geographic distribution of revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):
_________________________________
* Denotes % of total revenue
** Denotes % change from 2020 to 2021
•Americas revenue increased, reflecting sales increases of $18.4 million within our Networking Platforms segment, $13.3 million within our Platform Software and Services segment, $12.4 million within our Global Services segment and $12.3 million within our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment.
•EMEA revenue increased, reflecting sales increases of $47.5 million within our Networking Platforms segment, $17.4 million within our Global Services segment, $8.7 million within our Platform Software and Services segment and $5.4 million within our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment. These sales increases were primarily due to increased sales to Web-scale providers in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and communications service providers in France and the United Kingdom.
•APAC revenue decreased, primarily reflecting sales decreases of $55.6 million within our Networking Platforms segment and $3.0 million within our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment. These decreases were partially offset by sales increases of $9.8 million within our Platform Software and Services segment and $2.1 million within our Global Services segment. Our Networking Platforms segment revenue sales decreases were primarily due to decreased sales to communications service providers in Japan, enterprise customers in Australia, and Web-scale providers in Singapore, partially offset by increased sales to enterprise customers in India.
In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our top ten customers contributed 55.5% and 54.5% of our revenue, respectively. Consequently, our financial results are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers and can be significantly affected by market, industry or competitive dynamics affecting the businesses of those customers. Our reliance on a relatively small number of customers increases our exposure to changes in their spending levels, network priorities and purchasing strategies. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly depending on sales volumes and purchasing priorities with these large customers. Sales to AT&T were $447.4 million, or 12.4% of total revenue, in fiscal 2021, and $373.2 million, or 10.6% of total revenue, in fiscal 2020. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020.
While drivers of bandwidth growth and network evolution remain strong, many of our network operator customers are under pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets, and their businesses cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. As a result, as we innovate and introduce new and more robust solutions that increase capacity or add features, there is a market expectation for solutions that are more cost-effective than existing or competing solutions and that new products consistently deliver lower price per bit performance. The combination of this regular technology-driven price compression, price competition in our markets and ongoing customer efforts to manage network costs can impact our growth rates and requires that we increase our volume of product shipments to maintain and grow revenue.
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
Product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party contract manufacturers, component costs, employee-related costs and overhead, shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing-related operations, warranty and other contractual obligations, royalties, license fees, amortization of intangible assets, cost of excess and obsolete inventory and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts.
Services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third-party costs associated with our provision of services including installation, deployment, maintenance support, consulting and training activities, and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts. The majority of these costs relate to personnel, including employee and third-party contractor-related costs.
Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or “gross margin,” can fluctuate due to a number of factors, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. Our gross margin can fluctuate and be adversely impacted depending on our revenue concentration within a particular segment, product line, geography, or customer, including our success in selling software in a particular period. Our gross margin remains highly dependent on our continued ability to drive annual product cost reductions relative to the price erosion that we regularly encounter in our markets. This can be challenging, particularly within the current supply constrained environment. Moreover, we are often required to compete with aggressive pricing and commercial terms, and, to secure business with new and existing customers, we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that adversely affect our gross margin. Success in taking share and winning new business can result in additional pressure on gross margin from these pricing dynamics and the early stages of these network deployments. Early stages of new network builds also often include an increased concentration of lower margin “common” equipment, photonics sales and installation services, with the intent to improve margin as we sell channel cards and maintenance services to customers as they add capacity and need to monitor their networks. Gross margin can be impacted by technology-based price compression and the introduction or substitution of new platforms with improved price for performance as compared to existing solutions that carry higher margins. Gross margin can also be impacted by changes in expense for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty obligations.
Service gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services, particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services, geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business.
In fiscal 2021, we recorded CEWS benefits of $7.0 million, net of certain fees, related to the particular line item within costs of goods sold in our Consolidated Statement of Operations to which the grant activity related. For further information relating to our receipt of amounts under the CEWS program, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. The tables below set forth the changes in revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):
_________________________________
* Denotes % of total revenue

** Denotes % change from 2020 to 2021
•Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased by $69.1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue (“gross margin”) increased by 80 basis points. Our gross margin benefited from product cost reductions and a $7.0 million benefit from the CEWS program, partially offset by market-based price compression that we encountered during the period and a reduction in our services gross margin. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and related restrictions on sales and marketing activities described in “Overview” above, a higher proportion of our fiscal 2021 revenue consisted of sales of existing technology offerings deployed in the networks of existing customers, as compared to sales to new customers, early stage network deployments for recent design wins, or the introduction of new platforms, all of which tend to carry lower margins. We expect our future gross margins to reduce from these elevated short-term levels as the adverse impact of the pandemic on new business lessens and our overall revenue resumes a more typical composition of revenue from existing and new business. Moreover, as described in “Overview” above, we expect the current market shortage for semiconductor components and constrained supply environment to increase our costs of goods sold and to adversely impact our gross margin during fiscal 2022. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our business and financial results will persist, at least through the first half of calendar 2022, and may extend into periods thereafter.
•Gross profit on products as a percentage of product revenue increased by $46.3 million. Gross profit on products as a percentage of product revenue (“product gross margin”) increased by 130 basis points, primarily due to product cost reductions and a $4.3 million benefit from the CEWS program, partially offset by market-based price compression we encountered during the period as mentioned above.
•Gross profit on services as a percentage of services revenue increased by $22.8 million. Gross profit on services as a percentage of service revenue (“service gross margin) decreased by 190 basis points, primarily due to lower installation and deployment margins. The lower margins on installation and deployment services were primarily due to certain customer site readiness delays that caused cost inefficiencies. Lower service margins were also driven by higher compensation costs associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan. These lower margins were partially offset by a $2.7 million benefit from the CEWS program.
Operating Expense
Currency Fluctuations
During fiscal 2021, approximately 49.4% of our operating expense was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, including Canadian Dollars, Indian Rupees, British Pounds and Euros. During fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, the U.S. Dollar primarily weakened against these and other currencies. Consequently, our operating expense reported in U.S. Dollars increased by approximately $15.1 million, or 1.2%, net of hedging.
CEWS Program Benefits
In fiscal 2021, we recorded CEWS benefits of $34.3 million, net of certain fees, related to the particular line item within operating expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations to which the grant activity related. For further information relating to our receipt of amounts under the CEWS program, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Operating expense increased in fiscal 2021 from the level reported for fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in certain variable compensation costs associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan, offset by decreases in travel and
entertainment costs as a result of the impact of COVID-19. We expect operating expense to continue to increase from the level reported in fiscal 2021 primarily due to planned investment in research and development to advance our strategy and our expectation that customer engagement and related travel and entertainment costs will begin to normalize.
Operating expense consists of the component elements described below.
•Research and development expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense), prototype costs relating to design, development, product testing, depreciation expense, and third-party consulting costs.
•Selling and marketing expense primarily consists of salaries, commissions and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense) and sales and marketing support expense, including travel, demonstration units, trade show expense, and third-party consulting costs.
•General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense) and costs for third-party consulting and other services.
•Significant asset impairments and restructuring costs primarily reflect actions we have taken to improve the alignment of our workforce, facilities and operating costs with perceived market opportunities, business strategies, changes in market and business conditions, the redesign of certain business processes and significant impairments of assets.
•Amortization of intangible assets primarily reflects the amortization of both purchased technology and the value of customer relationships derived from our acquisitions.
•Acquisition and integration costs primarily consist of employee-related costs associated with a three-year earn-out arrangement related to the acquisition of DonRiver Holdings, LLC (“DonRiver”) in fiscal 2018 and other fees related to the acquisition of Centina Systems, Inc. (“Centina”) in fiscal 2020.
The table below sets forth the changes in operating expense for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):
_________________________________
* Denotes % of total revenue
** Denotes % change from 2020 to 2021
•Research and development expense was adversely affected by $6.7 million as a result of foreign exchange rates, net of hedging, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Canadian Dollar. Including the effect of foreign exchange rates, research and development expense increased by $6.8 million. This increase primarily reflects an increase in employee and compensation costs associated with higher headcount, and our annual cash incentive compensation plan, partially offset by $29.5 million received from the CEWS program and a decrease in professional services.
•Selling and marketing expense was adversely affected by $6.8 million as a result of foreign exchange rates, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Canadian Dollar and Euro. Including the effect of foreign exchange rates, sales and marketing expense increased by $35.8 million. This increase primarily reflects an increase in employee and compensation costs associated with higher sales commissions, partially offset by decreases in travel and entertainment costs as a result of COVID-19.
•General and administrative expense was adversely affected by $1.6 million as a result of foreign exchange rates, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Canadian Dollar and Euro. Including the effect of foreign exchange rates, general and administrative expense increased by $12.3 million. This increase primarily reflects an increase in employee and compensation costs associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan and legal fees, partially offset by reduced bad debt expense.
•Significant asset impairments and restructuring costs reflect actions that we have taken to redesign certain business processes and align our global workforce and facilities as part of a business optimization strategy to improve gross margin and constrain operating expense.
•Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively unchanged.
•Acquisition and integration costs primarily reflect acquisition compensation associated with a three-year earn-out arrangement related to the acquisition of DonRiver in fiscal 2018 and other fees related to the acquisition of Centina in fiscal 2020.
Other Items
The table below sets forth the changes in other items for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):

* Denotes % of total revenue
** Denotes % change from 2020 to 2021
•Interest and other income (loss), net decreased, primarily reflecting lower interest income due to reduced interest rates on our investments, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the relevant functional currency, net of hedging activity.
•Interest expense remained relatively unchanged.
•Loss on extinguishment and modification of debt reflects the refinance of our 2025 Term Loan. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
•Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased, primarily due to the $119.3 million tax benefit associated with recording a deferred tax asset for fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was lower as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the tax benefit associated with recording a deferred tax asset. For further discussion, see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview. For the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021, we generated $541.6 million of cash from operations, as our net income (adjusted for non-cash charges) of $609.8 million exceeded our working capital requirements of $68.2 million. For additional details on our cash provided by operating activities, see the discussion below under the caption “Cash Provided By Operating Activities.”
Cash, cash equivalents and investments increased by $352.6 million during fiscal 2021. The cash from operations above was partially offset by the following: (i) cash used to fund our investing activities for capital expenditures totaling $79.6 million; (ii) cash used for stock repurchase under our stock repurchase program of $91.3 million; (iii) stock repurchased upon vesting of our stock unit awards to employees relating to tax withholding of $44.1 million; and (iv) cash used for payments on our term loan due September 28, 2025 (the “2025 Term Loan”) of $6.9 million. Proceeds from the issuance of equity under our employee stock purchase plans provided $28.5 million in cash during fiscal 2021.
See Notes 19 and 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for information relating to these transactions.
The following table sets forth changes in our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities (in thousands):
Principal Sources of Liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity on hand include our cash and investments, which as of October 30, 2021 totaled $1.67 billion, as well as the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to which we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties (the “ABL Credit Facility”). The ABL Credit Facility, which we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into on October 28, 2019, replaced a predecessor senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and provides for a total commitment of $300 million with a maturity date of October 28, 2024. We principally use the ABL Credit Facility to support the issuance of letters of credit that arise in the ordinary course of our business and thereby to reduce our use of cash required to collateralize these instruments. As of October 30, 2021, letters of credit totaling $87.4 million were outstanding under our ABL Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as of October 30, 2021.
Foreign Liquidity. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was $432.3 million as of October 30, 2021. We intend to reinvest indefinitely our foreign earnings. If we were to repatriate these accumulated historical foreign earnings, the provisional amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to foreign
withholding taxes would be approximately $32.0 million. See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Stock Repurchase Authorization. On December 13, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, which replaced in its entirety the previous stock repurchase program authorized in fiscal 2018. We repurchased $92.1 million under this program during fiscal 2021. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this program after October 30, 2021. On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, which replaced in its entirety the previous stock repurchase program authorized in fiscal 2019. On December 13, 2021, in connection with this repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for the repurchase of $250.0 million of our common stock. The amount and timing of the remaining repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price and general business and market conditions. The program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. See Note 28 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Liquidity Position. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash from operations, cash, cash equivalents, investments, and other sources of liquidity, including our ABL Credit Facility, will satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through the next 12 months and the reasonably foreseeable future. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations, and anticipated cash needs to fund our operating or investment plans, and will continue to consider capital raising and other market opportunities that may be available to us. We regularly evaluate alternatives to manage our capital structure and market opportunities to enhance our liquidity and provide further operational and strategic flexibility. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to disruptions and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. Any potential further economic or market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to access capital markets, in the future.

As compared to the end of fiscal 2020:
•The $174.4 million of cash used in accounts receivable during fiscal 2021 reflects increased sales volume at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021;
•The $47.6 million of cash used in inventory during fiscal 2021 primarily reflects increases in raw materials inventory related to the steps we are taking to mitigate the impact of current supply chain constraints and the global market shortage of semiconductor parts described in “Overview” above;
•The $19.7 million of cash used in prepaid expenses and other during fiscal 2021 primarily reflects increases in contract assets for unbilled accounts receivable, capitalized commissions and foreign currency forward contracts, partially offset by decreases in upfront future discounts paid to customers and product demonstration equipment;
•The $162.1 million of cash provided by accounts payable, accruals and other obligations during fiscal 2021 primarily reflects higher provisions under our annual cash incentive compensation plan, and increased income taxes payable;
•The $16.8 million of cash provided by deferred revenue during fiscal 2021 represents an increase in advanced payments received from customers prior to revenue recognition; and
•The $5.5 million of cash used in operating lease assets and liabilities, net, during fiscal 2021 represents cash paid for operating lease payments in excess of operating lease costs. For more details, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Our days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) were 98 for fiscal 2021 as compared to 82 for fiscal 2020. Our inventory turns decreased from 4.6 turns during fiscal 2020 to 4.1 turns during fiscal 2021 due to the increase in inventory. The calculation of DSOs includes accounts receivable, net and contract assets for unbilled receivables, net included in prepaid expenses and other.
Cash Paid for Interest
The following table sets forth the cash paid for interest during fiscal 2021 (in thousands):
(1) Interest on the New 2025 Term Loan is payable periodically based on the interest period selected for borrowing. The New 2025 Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR for the chosen borrowing period plus a spread of 1.75% subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 0.00%. At the end of fiscal 2021, the interest rate on the New 2025 Term Loan was 1.84%.
(2) The interest rate swaps fix the LIBOR rate for $350.0 million of the New 2025 Term Loan at 2.957% through September 2023.
(3) During fiscal 2021, we utilized the ABL Credit Facility and its predecessor to collateralize certain standby letters of credit and paid $1.9 million in commitment fees, interest expense and other administrative charges relating to the ABL Credit Facility.
