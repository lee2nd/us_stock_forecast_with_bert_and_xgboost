ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Overview
We are a Nevada corporation formed on August 30, 1985. Our headquarters are in Englewood, Colorado. We have been engaged in our current business model since June of 2016, as a result of our having been discharged from a receivership and acquiring Life Marketing, Inc., which was in a different industry as our previous business.
We have experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, including in our current business model. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we ramp up our expansion, which likely will lead to additional losses, until such time that we approach profitability, or which there are no assurances. We have relied on equity and debt financing to fund operations to-date. There can be no guarantee that we will ever become profitable, or that adequate additional financing will be realized in the future or otherwise may be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our expansion efforts. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, of which there are no assurances.
Trends and Uncertainties
Our business is subject to the trends and uncertainties associated with expansion of
of niche industry social networks and ecommerce solutions are increasing in popularity and availability. At some point, industry saturation of technology solutions that we provide to, and support for TBI participant tech startup companies will make it more difficult for our business model to expand. This will force our company to innovate new technology solutions, which will undoubtedly cost more money to fund.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We had an accumulated deficit of $31,766,214 at December 31, 2020, had a net loss of $202,720 and used net cash of $422,337 in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand. While we believe that we will be successful generating revenue to fund our operations, meet regulatory requirements and achieve commercial goals, there are no assurances that we will succeed in our future operations.
We will attempt to overcome the going concern opinion by increasing our revenues, as follows:
● By increasing our TBI licensing to additional tech company startups;
The foregoing goals will increase expenses and lead to possible net losses. There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance we will be successful in any of these goals.

Consolidated Performance - Results of Operations for the 3-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues
For the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from licensing of $62,500 compared to $225,000 of revenue for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The $162,500 decrease is due to a renewed licensing deal with two of our licensees that provides for a minimum guarantee annual payment of $125,000 from each of our licensees through 2020 rather than relying on transactional usage of our platform in first quarter 2019.
For the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized $1,510 digital subscription revenue as compared to $7,396 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The $5,886 decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to recognizing digital subscription service of MjLink over twelve months of service.
For the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized zero event revenue as compared to $35,495 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The $35,495 decrease is primarily attributable to the mandatory COVID-19 shutdown, which forced our personnel to cancel all in-person contact at tradeshows, with investors, and related travel for the foreseeable future. We also wrote off $15,000 of unpaid fees due form attendance to our MjLink event in fiscal year 2019 as bad debt expense.
For the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized zero digital marketing revenue as compared to $39,800 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The $39,800 decrease is primarily attributable to the mandatory COVID-19 shutdown, which forced our personnel to cancel all in-person contact at tradeshows, with investors and travel for the foreseeable future and as a result there were no marketing campaigns to promote attendees at our events.
For the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized zero advertising revenue as compared to loss of $2,096 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The difference is primarily attributable to the mandatory COVID-19 shutdown, which forced our personnel to cancel all in-person contact at tradeshows, with investors and travel for the foreseeable future and as a result there were no marketing campaigns to promote attendees at our events.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue was a $116 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020 compared to $46,332 the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $46,216 or 100%. The decrease is primarily attributable to the mandatory COVID-19 shutdown, which forced our personnel to cancel all in-person contact at tradeshows, with investors and travel for the foreseeable future, plus the recoupment of some of our initial costs to set up events in the first quarter 2020 plus refunds from prepaid costs.
Operating Expenses
Cash-paid compensation expense decreased by $138,531 or 93% to $11,183 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020 from $149,714 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to reducing the need for consultants and professionals that were required to meet MjLink’s growth strategies at the onset of January 2019.
During the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized zero of non-cash stock-based compensation expense for employees, consultants, and professionals compared to $220,500 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a reduced need for additional headcount, streamlining headcount, and being able to maximize productivity with fewer hires as compared to our hiring plans in 2019.
During the 3-month periods ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized zero of non-cash stock-based compensation expense for warrants for the respective quarters.
Sales and marketing expense decreased $7,104 or 124% to negative $1,377 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020 from negative $5,727 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the mandatory COVID-19 shutdown, which forced MjLink to cancel any in-person events for the foreseeable future including in its first quarter 2020 as opposed to our investing/ramping-up efforts in 2019 plus refunds of prepaid expenses.
General and administrative expense decreased by $21,396, or 38% to $33,784 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020 from $55,181 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to the mandatory COVID-19 shutdown, which forced our personnel to cancel all in-person contact at tradeshows, with investors and travel for the foreseeable future. In addition, unrelated to COVID 19, the decrease is also due to a reduced need for additional headcount, streamlining headcount, and being able to maximize productivity with fewer hires as compared to our hiring plans in 2019 bringing the Company to a expense level to the level before the MjLink event business was contemplated. We also wrote off $15,000 of unpaid fees due from attendance to our MjLink event in fiscal year 2019 as bad debt expense.
Other expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $131,920 of other income from gain on conversion of convertible debt of $149,709 associated with converting our debt into common shares to our debt holders, which offset the interest charges of $17,789 from our convertible debt outstanding. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 we had zero other expenses or income.
Net Loss
Our net income for the for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2020 was $149,469 compared to a net loss of $179,898 for the 3-month period ending December 31, 2019. The decrease in net loss to profitability is a direct result of lack of issuance of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses to our personnel, decrease in operating expenses, gain from convertible debt conversions, and reduction in revenue due to the unprecedented and mandatory COVID-19 shutdown.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized zero advertising revenue as compared to $404 for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2019. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to eliminating our sales and marketing staff during the latter part of fiscal year 2019.
For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2020, we recognized zero event revenue as compared to $111,480 for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2019.

Income Tax
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% plus the Colorado income tax rate of 4.63% - combined rate of 25.63% - is being used due to the new tax law recently enacted.
Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of December 31:
The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate to tax-effected income from continuing operations for the period ended December 31, due to the following:
At December 31, 2019, the we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $0 that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2020 to 2036. No tax benefit has been reported in the December 31, 2020 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.
Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012.

The decrease in cash in financing activities is primarily attributable to the mandatory COVID-19 shutdown, unprecedented uncertainty in the financial markets, record unemployment figures, and a near halt in business activities for the foreseeable future created a dramatic pullback in risk appetite by current and potentially new investors.
We are in the early stages of our business. We are required to fund growth from financing activities, and we intend to rely on a combination of equity and debt financings. Due to market conditions and the early stage of our operations, there is significant risk that we will be unable to raise such financings at all, or on terms that are not overly dilutive to our existing stockholders. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds.

Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We continually monitor our banking relationships and consequently have not experienced any losses in our accounts. We believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.
Cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Accounts Receivable
Revenues that have been recognized but not yet received are recorded as accounts receivable. Losses on receivables will be recognized when it is more likely than not that a receivable will not be collected. An allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts will be recognized to reduce the amount of receivables to its net realizable value when considered necessary. Any allowance for uncollectible amounts is evaluated quarterly.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2019.
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Revenue recognition
The Company follows paragraph 605-15-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition when the right of return exists. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) The seller’s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale, (ii) The buyer has paid the seller, or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product. If the buyer does not pay at time of sale and the buyer’s obligation to pay is contractually or implicitly excused until the buyer resells the product, then this condition is not met., (iii) The buyer’s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product, (iv) The buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller. This condition relates primarily to buyers that exist on paper, that is, buyers that have little or no physical facilities or employees. It prevents entities from recognizing sales revenue on transactions with parties that the sellers have established primarily for the purpose of recognizing such sales revenue, (v) The seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer, and (vi) The amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated.
The Company generates revenues through three primary sources: 1) licensing agreements from which the Company receives an annual license fee or a percentage of net profits; 2) online advertising with priced based on the CPC (cost per click) and CPM (cost per 1000 ad impressions); and 3) premium monthly digital marketing subscriptions, which provide business director and online review management for monthly subscriptions.
Income taxes
The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date.
On December 22, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law by the President of the United States. TCJA is a tax reform act that among other things, reduced corporate tax rates to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates in the year of enactment, which is the year in which the change was signed into law. Accordingly, the Company adjusted its deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31,2019, using the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent. See Note 7.
The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to uncertainty income taxes. Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25.
Stock-based Compensation
We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (“ASC 505-50”). ASC 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract.
We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had 9,603,721,664 and 2,179,256,699 potentially dilutive shares; however, the diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an antidilutive effect due to our loss from operations.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires restricted cash to be presented with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and disclosure of how the statement of cash flows reconciles to the balance sheet if restricted cash is shown separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory, which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its financial statements.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 provides guidance for targeted changes with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of cash flows, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its statements of cash flows.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09, which amends several aspects of accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company has evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update and noted that it has had no material impact.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and has since issued amendments thereto, related to the accounting for leases (collectively referred to as “ASC 842”). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company will adopt ASC 842 on January 1, 2021. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. Entities have the option to continue to apply historical accounting under Topic 840, including its disclosure requirements, in comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. An entity that elects this option will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption instead of the earliest period presented. The Company expects to elect to apply the optional ASC 842 transition provisions beginning on January 1, 2021. Accordingly, the Company will continue to apply Topic 840 prior to January 1, 2021, including Topic 840 disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented. The Company expects to elect the package of practical expedients for all its leases that commenced before January 1, 2021. The Company has evaluated its real estate lease, its copier leases and its generator rental agreements. The Company expects that the adoption of ASC 842 will materially impact its balance sheet and have an immaterial impact on its results of operations. Based on the Company’s current agreements, the Company expects that upon the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2021, it will record an operating lease liability of approximately $33,000 and corresponding ROU assets based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments associated with the Company’s leases. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, nor is one readily available, the Company will use its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at January 1, 2021 to determine the present value of its future minimum rental payments.
In May 2014, August 2015, April 2016 and May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2015-14 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2016- from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2015-14 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2016-10 (ASC Topic 10 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU 2016-12 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with 606) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU 2016-12 (ASC Topic 606) Revenue from Contracts with accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amendments in these ASUs are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted this process in 2020.
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01 (ASU 2017-01) “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” ASU 2017-01 provides guidance to evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired (or disposed of) are not considered a business. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Stock Warrants
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, we granted zero, 1,594,853, and zero warrants, respectively, to our advisors and employees, totaling 17,894,873 warrants (the “17,894,873 Warrants”). Each warrant entitles the holder to one Social Life Network common stock share at an exercise price ranging from five to twenty cents, with a weighted average price of seven cents. The term of our warrants have a range from 3 to 5 years from the initial exercise date. The warrants will be expensed as they become exercisable beginning January 1, 2018 through April 11, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, 300,000 additional warrants vested, and as of September 30, 2020 the 17,894,873 Warrants are 100% vested. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we executed a cashless conversion of 8,800,020 vested warrants in exchange for 4,400,010 common stock shares and during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we executed a cashless conversion of 30,000 vested warrants in exchange for 293,118,280 common stock shares during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The remaining 9,064,853 outstanding warrants are currently 100% vested to date and not exercised. The aggregate fair value of the warrants as of December 31, 2020 total $2,238,800, which values are based on the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model using the following estimates: exercise price ranging from $0.00 to $0.20, stock prices ranging from $0.0001 to $0.38, risk free rates ranging from 0.10% - 1.60%, volatility ranging from 391% to 562%, and expected life of the warrants ranging from 3 to 5 years.
A summary of the status of the outstanding stock warrants and changes during the periods is presented below:
Convertible Note Payable
We have the following convertible notes payable as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
(A) On April 15, 2019, we completed a 7-month term original issue discount convertible note and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate $100,000 in additional available cash resources with a payback provision due and was paid in full on November 14, 2019 of $117,700 which includes the original issue discount of $10,000 and interest of $7,700. In connection therewith, we issued 150,000 common stock shares and additional 102,176 common stock shares on October 15, 2019, per our original agreement, 412,500 common stock warrants, and reserved 301,412,500 restricted common shares for conversion. The shares were issued during the three months ended June 30, 2019. The conversion price is fixed at $0.15. Pursuant to current accounting guidelines, we determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the note created a fair value discount of $13,333 at the date of issuance when the stock price was at $0.17 per share.
(B) On April 15, 2019, we completed convertible debenture at zero interest and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate $375,000 in additional available cash resources, the funds of which will be released over the 90 days following execution of the agreement in the amounts of $67,500, $90,000, and $180,000, with a payback provision of $75,000, $100,000, and $200,000, respectively, over 36 months. In connection therewith, the Company issued 300,000 common stock warrants, and 20,192,307 restricted common shares as reserve for conversion. The note was unsecured and did not bear interest; however, the implied interest was determined to be 10% over 36 months since the note was issued at a 10% discount. Subsequently, on June 26, 2019 we nullified the agreement and other related documents with this funding group after the initial disbursement of $67,500. We refunded the initial tranche of $67,500, a 10% redemption fee of $7,500 for the principle amount plus for the original issue discount of $7,500, and other additional administrative fees of $30,000, which totaled $105,000. The 300,000 common stock warrants will remain issued and the reserved common shares will be reduced enough to satisfy the warrants.
(C) On May 24, 2019, we completed a 7-month fixed convertible promissory note and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate $240,000, which will be distributed in three equal monthly tranches of $80,000, in additional available cash resources with a payback provision of $80,000 plus the original issue discount of $4,000 or $84,000 due seven months from each funding date for each tranche, totaling $252,000. We generated $160,000 in additional available cash resources with a payback provision due on December 23, 2019 and February 2, 2020 totaling $184,800 which includes the original issue discount of $8,000 plus interest of $16,800. In connection therewith, we issued 50,000 common stock shares for two tranches with another 25,000 common stock shares to be issued with the third tranche, and we have reserved 8,000,000 which was subsequently increased to 3 billion restricted common shares for conversion. The conversion price is the lower of $0.08 or sixty five percent (65%) of the 2 lowest traded prices of the Common Stock for the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of the date of conversion. We determined that because the conversion price is variable and unknown, it could not determine if it had enough authorized shares to fulfill the conversion obligation. As such, pursuant to current accounting guidelines, we determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the note created a fair value discount of $130,633 at the date of issuance when the stock price was at $0.12 per share.
(D) On June 12, 2019, we completed a 12-month convertible promissory note and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate $110,000 in additional available cash resources with a payback provision due on June 11, 2020 of $135,250 which includes the original issue discount of $11,000 plus interest of $14,250. In connection with the note, we have reserved 14,400,000 restricted common shares as reserve for conversion. The conversion price is a 35% discount to the average of the two (2) lowest trading prices during the previous twenty (20) trading days to the date of a Conversion Notice. We determined that because the conversion price is variable and unknown, it could not determine if we had enough authorized shares to fulfill the conversion obligation. On December 19, 2019, we converted $10,000 of principle into 495,472,078 shares of common stock at approximately $0.035 per share. As such, pursuant to current accounting guidelines, we determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the note created a fair value discount of $59,231 at the date of issuance when the stock price was at $0.11 per share.
(E) On June 26, 2019, we completed a 9-month senior convertible promissory note and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate $135,000 in additional available cash resources with a payback provision due on March 25, 2020 of $168,000 which includes the original issue discount of $15,000 plus interest of $18,000. In connection with the note, we issued 100,000 common stock shares and has reserved 15,000,000, which was subsequently increased to 1 billion restricted common shares for conversion. The conversion price is the lower of $0.08 or sixty five percent (65%) of the 2 lowest traded prices of the Common Stock for the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of the date of conversion. We determined that because the conversion price is variable and unknown, it could not determine if we had enough authorized shares to fulfill the conversion obligation. As such, pursuant to current accounting guidelines, we determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the note created a fair value discount of $72,692 at the date of issuance when the stock price was at $0.11 per share.
(F) On August 7, 2019, we completed a 12-month convertible promissory note and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate $100,000 in additional available cash resources with a payback provision due on August 6, 2020 of $121,000 which includes the original issue discount of $10,000 plus interest of $11,000. In connection with the note, we issued 100,000 common stock shares and has reserved 677,973,124, which was subsequently increased to 105,769,231, restricted common shares for conversion. The conversion price is the lower of $0.08 or sixty five percent (65%) of the 2 lowest traded prices of the Common Stock for the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of the date of conversion. We determined that because the conversion price is variable and unknown, it could not determine if we had enough authorized shares to fulfill the conversion obligation. As such, pursuant to current accounting guidelines, we determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the note created a fair value discount of $73,750 at the date of issuance when the stock price was at $0.09 per share.
(G) On August 21, 2019, we completed a 12-month convertible promissory note and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate $148,500, which will be distributed in three equal monthly tranches of $49,500, in additional available cash resources with a payback provision of $49,500 plus the original issue discount of $5,500 or $55,000 due twelve months from each funding date for each tranche, totaling $165,000. We generated $49,500 in additional available cash resources with a payback provision due on August 20, 2020 totaling $60,500 which includes the original issue discount of $5,500 plus interest of $5,500. In connection therewith, we issued 50,000 common stock shares for the first tranche with another 50,000 common stock shares to be issued with each additional tranche, which will total 150,000 common shares; we have reserved 15,714, which was subsequently increased to 2 billion restricted common shares for conversion. The conversion price is the 35% discount to the average of the two (2) lowest trading prices during the previous twenty (20) trading days to the date of a Conversion Notice. We determined that because the conversion price is variable and unknown, it could not determine if it had enough authorized shares to fulfill the conversion obligation. As such, pursuant to current accounting guidelines, we determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the note created a fair value discount of $26,654 at the date of issuance when the stock price was approximately $0.07 per share.
(H) On January 28, 2020, we completed a 12-month convertible promissory note and other related documents with an unaffiliated third-party funding group to generate up to $925,000, which will be distributed in multiple tranches to be determined, in additional available cash resources with a payback provision of principle debt without an original issue discount plus interest. We generated $63,000 in additional available cash resources with a payback provision due on January 27, 2021 totaling $69,300 which includes the principle plus interest of $6,300. We have reserved 41,331,475, which was subsequently increased to 1billion restricted common shares for conversion. The conversion price is the 39% discount to the average of the two (2) lowest trading prices during the previous fifteen (15) trading days to the date of a Conversion Notice. We determined that because the conversion price is variable and unknown, it could not determine if it had enough authorized shares to fulfill the conversion obligation. As such, pursuant to current accounting guidelines, we determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the note created a fair value discount of $40,279 at the date of issuance when the stock price was approximately $0.01 per share. On August 24, 2020, we fully met and timely paid its debt obligation.
