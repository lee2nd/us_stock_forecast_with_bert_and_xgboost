Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
OVERVIEW
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon management's current expectations and are subject to various uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements are set forth below under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements."
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include NACCO Industries, Inc.® (“NACCO” or the “Company”). NACCO, through a portfolio of mining and natural resources businesses, operates under three business segments: Coal Mining, North American Mining ("NAMining") and Minerals Management. The Coal Mining segment operates surface coal mines under long-term contracts with power generation companies and an activated carbon producer pursuant to a service-based business model. The NAMining segment provides value-added contract mining and other services for producers of aggregates, lithium and other minerals. The Minerals Management segment acquires and promotes the development of oil, gas and coal mineral interests, generating income primarily from royalty-based lease payments from third parties. In addition, the Company has a business providing stream and wetland mitigation solutions.
The Company has items not directly attributable to a reportable segment which are not included as part of the measurement of segment operating profit, which are primarily administrative costs related to public company reporting requirements at the parent company and the financial results of Mitigation Resources of North America® (“MRNA”) and Bellaire Corporation (“Bellaire”). MRNA generates and sells stream and wetland mitigation credits (known as mitigation banking) and provides services to those engaged in permittee-responsible stream and wetland mitigation. Bellaire manages the Company’s long-term liabilities related to former Eastern U.S. underground mining activities.
As of January 1, 2020, the Company retrospectively changed its computation of segment operating profit to reclassify certain expenses, primarily related to executive and board compensation. These expenses are now included in unallocated items. The change in segment reporting reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the Company’s segments excluding executive and board compensation. All prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. This segment reporting change has no impact on consolidated operating results.
All financial statement line items below operating profit (other income, including interest expense and interest income, the provision for income taxes and net income) are presented and discussed within this Form 10-K on a consolidated basis.
See “Item 1. Business" beginning on page 1 in this Form 10-K for further discussion of NACCO's subsidiaries. Additional information relating to financial and operating data on a segment basis (including unallocated items) is set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities (if any). On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, actuarial valuations and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Revenue recognition: Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's revenue recognition.

NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company's asset retirement obligations are principally for costs to close its surface mines and reclaim the land it has disturbed as a result of its normal mining activities as well as for costs to dismantle certain mining equipment at the end of the life of the mine. Under certain federal and state regulations, the Company is required to reclaim land disturbed as a result of mining. The Company determined the amounts of these obligations based on cost estimates, adjusted for inflation, projected to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Changes in any of these estimates could materially change the Company's estimates for these asset retirement obligations causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate. The accretion of the liability is being recognized over the estimated life of each individual asset retirement obligation. The Company has capitalized an asset’s retirement cost as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset. These capitalized amounts are subsequently amortized to expense using a systematic and rational method.
Bellaire is a non-operating subsidiary of the Company with legacy liabilities relating to closed mining operations, primarily former Eastern U.S. underground coal mining operations. These legacy liabilities include obligations for water treatment and other environmental remediation that arose as part of the normal course of closing these underground mining operations. The Company determined the amounts of these obligations based on cost estimates, adjusted for inflation, and then discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. The accretion of the liability is recognized over the estimated life of the asset retirement obligation. Since Bellaire's properties are no longer active operations, no associated asset has been capitalized.
Changes in any of these estimates could materially change the Company's estimates for these asset retirement obligations causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating income in the period of change in the estimate. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's asset retirement obligations.
Long-lived assets: The Company periodically evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances or the occurrence of certain events indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon identification of indicators of impairment, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the asset by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition with the asset's net carrying value. If the carrying value of an asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is estimated as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company regularly performs reviews of potential future development projects and identified certain undeveloped properties where market conditions related to any future development deteriorated during 2020. As a result, the Company recognized charges of $7.3 million in the Minerals Management segment and $1.1 million in the Coal Mining segment to write-off certain capitalized leasehold costs, prepaid royalties and other assets during 2020.
At MLMC, the costs of mining operations are not reimbursed by MLMC's customer. As such, increased costs at MLMC or decreased revenues could materially reduce the Company's profitability. Any reduction in customer demand at MLMC, including reductions related to reduced mechanical availability of the customer’s power plant, would adversely affect the Company's operating results and could result in significant impairments. MLMC has approximately $135 million of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and its coal supply agreement intangible asset, which are subject to periodic impairment analysis and review. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including assumptions about future power plant dispatch levels, changes in operating costs and other factors that impact anticipated revenue and customer demand, requires significant judgment. Actual future operating results could differ significantly from these estimates, which may result in an impairment charge in a future period, which could have a substantial impact on the Company’s results of operations.
Income taxes: Tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted laws and tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, or changes in the structure or tax status.
The Company's tax assets, liabilities, and tax expense are supported by historical earnings and losses and the Company's best estimates and assumptions of future earnings. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using to manage the underlying businesses. When the Company determines, based on all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established.
Since significant judgment is required to assess the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns, the ultimate resolution of these events could result in adjustments to the Company's financial statements and such adjustments could be material. The Company believes the current assumptions, judgments and other considerations used to estimate the current year accrued and deferred tax positions are appropriate. If the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from these estimates and assumptions, due to changes or future events, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUMMARY
The results of operations for NACCO were as follows for the years ended December 31:
The components of the change in revenues and operating profit are discussed below in "Segment Results."
Other (income) expense, net
North American Coal Corporation India Private Limited ("NACC India") was formed to provide technical business advisory services to the third-party owner of a coal mine in India. During 2014, NACC India's customer defaulted on its contractual payment obligations and as a result of this default, NACC India terminated its contract with the customer and began pursuing contractual remedies. During 2019, the Company received payment of $2.7 million from NACC India's customer, of which $1.4 million related to past invoices and has been reported on the line Other, net, and $1.3 million represented interest income and has been reported on the line Interest income. During 2020, the Company received an additional payment of $1.0 million from NACC India's customer which has been reported on the line, Other, net. Both of these lines are in the Other (income) expense section of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not expect to receive any additional payments from NACC India’s customer.
Interest expense increased $0.5 million due to higher average borrowings during 2020 compared with 2019.
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
Interest income decreased $2.4 million primarily due to the interest income related to the NACC India customer payment the Company received in 2019 and lower interest rates on invested cash during 2020 compared with 2019.
Income from other unconsolidated affiliates represents the financial results of NoDak. NoDak operated and maintained a coal drying system at a customer’s power plant. The NoDak contract expired on January 31, 2020, resulting in a decrease of $1.1 million in Income from other unconsolidated affiliates during 2020 compared with 2019.
Gain on equity securities represents changes in the market price of invested assets reported at fair value. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Mine Water Treatment Trust.
Other, net, increased $0.6 million primarily due to the absence of $0.9 million in settlement expense for the Combined Defined Benefit Plan recognized during 2019. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement expense.
Income Taxes
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 on income before income tax of $14.3 million, or (3.8%), compared to income tax expense of $3.8 million on income before income tax of $43.4 million, or 8.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes $7.3 million of discrete tax charges primarily related to settlement of tax examinations, reserves for uncertain tax positions and return to provision adjustments partially offset by a benefit of $4.7 million, primarily due the rate differential related to carrying back losses under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"). The CARES Act allows net operating tax losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company generated a net tax operating loss in 2020 primarily due to the realization of certain deferred tax assets. Discrete tax items in the year ended December 31, 2019 were a benefit of $2.5 million primarily resulting from changes in prior year estimates and the effective settlement of certain discrete tax items from on-going examinations.
The Company’s effective income tax rate, excluding the CARES Act and discrete items, was (22.0%) and 14.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit from percentage depletion. The benefit of percentage depletion is not directly related to the amount of pre-tax income recorded in a period. Accordingly, as a result of the $29.1 million reduction in income before income tax in 2020 compared to 2019, the proportional effect of the benefit from percentage depletion on the effective income tax rate in 2020 resulted in a significantly lower effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019.
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
The following tables detail the change in cash flow for the years ended December 31:
The $55.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of unfavorable working capital changes and the decrease in net income, partially offset by impairment charges. Working capital changes primarily included:
•Increased payments made under deferred compensation and long-term incentive compensation plans during 2020 compared with 2019.
•An increase in Accounts receivables during 2020 compared to a decrease during 2019. The large decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the timing of customer requirements at MLMC.
•A decrease in Accounts payable during 2020 compared to an increase during 2019 due to a change in timing.
The increase in net cash used for investing activities was primarily attributable to $14.2 million in acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests at the Minerals Management segment during 2020 compared with none during 2019.
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
The change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased borrowings during 2020 compared with 2019.
Financing Activities
Financing arrangements are obtained and maintained at the subsidiary level. NACCO has not guaranteed any borrowings of NACoal. The borrowing agreements at NACoal allow for the payment to NACCO of dividends and advances under certain circumstances. Dividends (to the extent permitted by NACoal's borrowing agreement) and management fees are the primary sources of cash for NACCO and enable the Company to pay dividends to stockholders.
The Company believes funds available from cash on hand, the NACoal Facility and operating cash flows will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs and commitments arising during the next twelve months and until the expiration of the NACoal Facility.
NACoal has an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to $150.0 million (the “NACoal Facility”) that expires in August 2022. Borrowings outstanding under the NACoal Facility were $30.0 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the excess availability under the NACoal Facility was $117.0 million, which reflects a reduction for outstanding letters of credit of $3.0 million.
The NACoal Facility has performance-based pricing, which sets interest rates based upon NACoal achieving various levels of debt to EBITDA ratios, as defined in the NACoal Facility. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate plus a margin based on the level of debt to EBITDA ratio achieved. The applicable margins, effective December 31, 2020, for base rate and LIBOR loans were 0.75% and 1.75%, respectively. The NACoal Facility has a commitment fee which is based upon achieving various levels of debt to EBITDA ratios. The commitment fee was 0.30% on the unused commitment at December 31, 2020. The weighted average interest rate applicable to the NACoal Facility at December 31, 2020 was 1.88% including the floating rate margin.
The NACoal Facility contains restrictive covenants, which require, among other things, NACoal to maintain a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 4.00 to 1.00. The NACoal Facility provides the ability to make loans, dividends and advances to NACCO, with some restrictions based on maintaining a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.00 to 1.00, or if greater than 2.00 to 1.00, a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, in conjunction with maintaining unused availability thresholds of borrowing capacity, as defined in the NACoal Facility, of $15.0 million. At December 31, 2020, NACoal was in compliance with all financial covenants in the NACoal Facility.
NACoal’s variable interest payments are calculated based upon NACoal’s anticipated payment schedule and the December 31, 2020 base rate and applicable margins, as defined in the NACoal Facility. A 1/8% increase in the base rate would increase NACoal’s estimated total annual interest payments on the NACoal Facility by less than $0.1 million.
Expenditures for property, plant and equipment and mineral interests
Following is a table which summarizes actual and planned expenditures (in millions):
Planned expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately $46 million, primarily consisting of $27 million in the Coal Mining segment, $10 million in the Minerals Management segment and $9 million in the NAMining segment.
In the Coal Mining segment, elevated levels of expected capital expenditures through 2021 are primarily related to spending at MLMC as it develops a new mine area. In the Minerals Management segment, expected expenditures in 2021 are primarily for the acquisition of mineral interests. In the NAMining segment, expected capital expenditures in 2021 are primarily for the acquisition, relocation and refurbishment of draglines.
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
Expenditures are expected to be funded from internally generated funds and/or bank borrowings.
Capital Structure
NACCO's consolidated capital structure is presented below:
The increase in other net tangible assets was primarily due to increases in Property, plant and equipment as well as payments made for deferred compensation and accrued incentive compensation during 2020.
Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments
NACCO adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)," on January 1, 2019. ASC 842 required a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for substantially all leases. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's leases.
Pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to plan amendments, changes in the market value of plan assets, legislation and the Company’s decisions to contribute above the minimum regulatory funding requirements. The Company does not expect to contribute to its pension plan in 2021. NACCO maintains one supplemental retirement plan that pays monthly benefits to participants directly out of corporate funds and expects to pay benefits of approximately $0.5 million in 2021 and approximately $0.5 million per year from 2022 through 2030. Benefit payments beyond that time cannot currently be estimated. All other pension benefit payments are made from assets of the pension plan. NACCO also expects to make payments related to its other postretirement plans of approximately $0.2 million per year from 2021 through 2030. Benefit payments beyond that time cannot currently be estimated.
NACCO has asset retirement obligations. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's asset retirement obligations.
NACCO has unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.
NACoal is a party to certain guarantees related to Coyote Creek. The Company believes that the likelihood of NACoal’s future performance under the guarantees is remote, and no amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's guarantees.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company is affected by the regulations of numerous agencies, particularly the Federal Office of Surface Mining, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and associated state regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company closely monitors proposed legislation and regulation concerning SMCRA, CAA, ACE, CWA, RCRA, CERCLA and other regulatory actions.
Compliance with these increasingly stringent regulations could result in higher expenditures for both capital improvements and operating costs. The Company’s policies stress environmental responsibility and compliance with these regulations. Based
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
on current information, management does not expect compliance with these regulations to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. See Item 1 in Part I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these matters.
SEGMENT RESULTS
COAL MINING SEGMENT
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Tons of coal delivered by the Coal Mining segment were as follows for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
Total coal reserves were as follows at December 31:
(1)Amount includes 0.1 billion of coal reserves owned or controlled by customers as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company conducts activities to extract these customer-owned and controlled reserves.
The results of operations for the Coal Mining segment were as follows for the years ended December 31:
(a) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's unconsolidated subsidiaries, including summarized financial information.
2020 Compared with 2019
Revenues increased 4.9% in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to an increase in price per ton attributable to reimbursable costs at MLMC. The sales price at MLMC is index-based and includes adjustments for coal quality and reimbursable costs.
Also contributing to the increase is reclamation revenue from Caddo Creek. On September 30, 2020, Caddo Creek's customer, a division of Cabot Corporation, entered into a long-term supply agreement with a subsidiary of Advanced Emissions Solutions (“AES”) as well as an agreement for the sale of the Marshall Mine, operated by Caddo Creek, to a subsidiary of
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
AES. AES announced its intent to close the Marshall Mine. Caddo Creek entered into a contract with a subsidiary of AES to perform the required mine reclamation. As a result of these changes, Caddo Creek financial results are now consolidated within the Coal Mining segment.
The following table identifies the components of change in operating profit for 2020 compared with 2019:
Operating profit decreased $8.7 million in 2020 compared with 2019. The change in operating profit was primarily due to:
•A decrease in earnings of unconsolidated operations, mainly due to a reduction in tons delivered as a result of decreases in customer demand and the termination of the Camino Real contract mining agreement during 2020.
•A $2.0 million inventory impairment charge at MLMC as mining costs exceeded net realizable value.
•A reduction in gross profit due to wind-down and employee-related expenses at Camino Real.
•During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a voluntary separation program for employees who met certain age and service requirements to reduce overall headcount. As a result of this program, the Coal Mining segment recorded a charge of $1.5 million related to one-time termination benefits.
•An increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due to a $1.1 million asset impairment charge, higher professional fees, outside service fees and insurance costs, partially offset by lower employee-related expenses.
•The favorable net change in Centennial's asset retirement obligation is attributable to the absence of a $2.5 million unfavorable revision that occurred during 2019, partially offset by a $0.4 million unfavorable revision that occurred during 2020. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's asset retirement obligations.

NORTH AMERICAN MINING ("NAMining") SEGMENT
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Tons of limestone delivered by the NAMining segment were as follows for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
The results of operations for the NAMining segment were as follows for the years ended December 31:
(a) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's unconsolidated subsidiaries, including summarized financial information.
2020 Compared with 2019
Revenues decreased 1.0% in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower reimbursed costs, which have an offsetting amount in cost of goods sold and have no impact on operating profit. The decrease was partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of customer requirements and work related to the Thacker Pass lithium project.
The following table identifies the components of change in operating profit (loss) for 2020 compared with 2019.
NAMining reported operating profit of $1.9 million in 2020 compared with an operating loss of $0.6 million in 2019. The change is primarily due to an increase in gross profit and in earnings of unconsolidated operations. Both variances are due to changes in the mix of customer requirements.

MINERALS MANAGEMENT SEGMENT
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The results of operations for the Minerals Management segment were as follows for the years ended December 31:
2020 Compared with 2019
Revenues and operating profit decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 as 2019 included significant royalty income generated by a large number of new gas wells put into commission in Ohio during 2018 and early 2019. These wells are operated by third parties to extract natural gas from the Company's Ohio Utica shale mineral reserves. Since new wells have high initial production rates and follow a natural decline before settling into relatively stable, long-term production, royalty income in 2020 decreased substantially from 2019 levels. Lower commodity prices in 2020 compared with 2019 also contributed to the reduction in revenues and operating profit. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is due to a $7.3 million asset impairment charge during 2020. The Company regularly performs reviews of potential future development projects and identified certain undeveloped properties where market conditions related to any future development deteriorated during 2020. As a result, the Company wrote-off certain capitalized leasehold costs and prepaid royalties related to legacy coal interests in 2020.
UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Unallocated Items and Eliminations were as follows for the years ended December 31:
2020 Compared with 2019
The $3.1 million decrease in operating loss during 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to lower employee-related expenses.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a voluntary separation program for employees who met certain age and service requirements to reduce overall headcount. As a result of this program, the 2020 operating loss includes a charge of $0.3 million related to one-time termination benefits.
NACCO Industries, Inc. Outlook
Coal Mining Outlook - 2021
In 2021, the Company expects coal deliveries to be comparable to 2020 based on current expectations of customer requirements.
Coal Mining operating profit in 2021 is expected to decrease significantly from 2020. This decrease is primarily attributable to substantially lower earnings expected at MLMC and reduced earnings at the unconsolidated Coal Mining operations. MLMC
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
earnings are expected to be lower as a result of an anticipated increase in the cost per ton of coal delivered in 2021 compared with 2020, due in part to an increase in depreciation expense associated with development of a new mine area. The anticipated reduction in earnings at the unconsolidated Coal Mining operations is expected to be mainly driven by a reduction in fee-based earnings at the Liberty Mine, as the scope of final mine reclamation activities is reduced. Lower operating profit is expected to be partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses primarily due to lower employee-related costs resulting from the 2020 voluntary separation program partially offset by higher insurance expense.
Changes in customer power plant dispatch, including changes related to natural gas price fluctuations and the continued increase in renewable generation, particularly wind, could reduce customer demand below anticipated levels, which could further unfavorably affect the Company’s 2021 outlook.
In May 2020, GRE, Falkirk Mine's customer and the Company's second largest customer, announced its intent to retire the Coal Creek Station power plant in the second half of 2022. GRE is willing to consider opportunities to sell Coal Creek Station, and NACCO is actively engaged in the exploration of options that could, if successful, allow for transfer of ownership of the power plant to one or more third parties, which would preserve jobs at both Coal Creek Station and the Falkirk Mine. Falkirk Mine is the sole supplier of lignite coal to Coal Creek Station pursuant to a long-term contract. The terms of the contract between the Company and GRE specify that GRE is responsible for all costs related to mine closure, including but not limited to, final mine reclamation costs, post-retirement medical benefits and pension costs with respect to Falkirk employees. This closure is not expected to affect 2021 results.
The owner of the power plant served by the Company's Sabine Mine in Texas intends to retire the power plant in 2023. The Sabine Mine contributed approximately $3.9 million to Earnings from Unconsolidated Operations in 2020. The terms of the contract between the Company and the customer specify that the customer is responsible for all costs related to mine closure, including but not limited to, final mine reclamation costs, post-retirement medical benefits and pension costs with respect to Sabine employees.
The closure of the power plants that are served by the Falkirk and Sabine Mines would have a material adverse effect on the future Earnings of unconsolidated operations of the Coal Mining segment and on the long-term earnings and cash flows of NACCO.
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $27 million in 2021. The elevated levels of capital expenditures in the Coal Mining segment from 2019 through 2021 relate to the development of a new mine area at MLMC. These increased capital expenditures will result in higher depreciation that will unfavorably affect operating profit in future periods. Capital expenditures for MLMC are expected to return to lower levels beginning in 2022 and continue through 2032, the end of the current contract term.
NAMining Outlook
In 2021, NAMining expects full year operating profit to increase moderately over 2020 with its existing customer contracts. NAMining is pursuing a number of growth initiatives that if successful would be accretive to future earnings.
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $9 million for the 2021 full year primarily for the acquisition, relocation and refurbishment of draglines.
In 2019, NAMining's subsidiary, Sawtooth Mining, LLC, entered into a mining agreement to serve as the exclusive contract miner for the Thacker Pass lithium project in northern Nevada, owned by Lithium Nevada Corp., a subsidiary of Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC). In January 2021, Thacker Pass received a Record of Decision from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for the Thacker Pass project following the completion of the National Environmental Policy Act Process. This decision represents an important milestone in the development and the permitting of the Thacker Pass project. More permitting decisions are expected later in 2021 with production expected to begin in the second half of 2022.
Minerals Management Outlook
The Minerals Management segment derives income from royalty-based leases under which lessees make payments to the Company based on their sale of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil, natural gas liquids and coal, extracted primarily by third parties. Excluding the impact of the $6.7 million write-off taken in 2020, operating profit in the Minerals Management

NACCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
segment is expected to be down substantially in 2021 from 2020. This decrease is primarily related to a reduction in royalty income from existing Ohio mineral and royalty assets as a result of expected lower natural gas prices, fewer expected new wells in Ohio, lower commodity prices and the natural production decline that occurs early in the life of a well. Another sustained decline in natural gas prices could unfavorably affect the Company’s outlook.
Decline rates for individual wells can vary due to factors like well depth, well length, formation pressure and facility design. In addition, royalty income can fluctuate favorably or unfavorably in response to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including the number of wells being operated by third parties, fluctuations in commodity prices (primarily natural gas), fluctuations in production rates associated with operator decisions, regulatory risks, the Company's lessees' willingness and ability to incur well-development and other operating costs, and changes in the availability and continuing development of infrastructure.
In 2020, the Minerals Management segment acquired mineral and royalty interests for approximately 65.5 thousand gross acres and 1.2 thousand net royalty acres in the Permian Basin in Texas for a total purchase price of approximately $14.2 million. The acquired interests align with the Company’s strategy of selectively acquiring mineral and royalty interests with a balance of near-term cash flow yields and long-term growth potential, in oil-rich basins offering diversification from the Company’s legacy mineral interests in predominately natural gas-rich basins. Including the 2020 acquisitions, total mineral and royalty interests include approximately 109.2 thousand gross acres and 58.1 thousand net royalty acres. Minerals Management is targeting additional investments in mineral and royalty interests of approximately $10 million in 2021. These investments are expected to be accretive to earnings, but each investment's contribution to earnings is dependent on the characteristics of each investment, including the size and type of interests acquired and the stage and timing of mineral development.
Consolidated 2021 Outlook
While the Company expects consolidated net income in 2021 to decrease significantly from 2020, management still continues to view the long-term business outlook positively because of a strong pipeline of potential new projects. The COVID-19 pandemic slowed certain business development initiatives in 2020, but the outlook for growth in the NAMining and Minerals Management segments and in the Company's Mitigation Resources of North America® business remains strong. Excluding the favorable impact of potential business development activities, the Company expects substantially lower pre-tax earnings as a result of lower operating profit, an anticipated increase in interest expense and a reduction in interest income. These lower pre-tax results are expected to be partially offset by an increase in the benefit from income taxes primarily due to the benefit from percentage depletion at certain of the Company's mining operations. Pre-tax income and net income are expected to be higher in the second half of 2021 than in the first half of 2021, primarily due to current expectations on the timing of customer requirements in the Coal Mining segment.
In light of ongoing regulatory, economic and public opinion challenges facing the coal-fired power generation industry, the Company commenced a voluntary separation program for certain corporate employees in the 2020 fourth quarter. The program was substantially completed by December 31, 2020. Estimated net benefits from this voluntary separation program are expected to be between $1.5 and $2.5 million annually beginning in 2021. As a result of this program and natural attrition, the number of headquarters employees was reduced by approximately 25%.
The Company’s cash flow before financing activities varies with changes in customer demand, particularly in the Coal Mining segment, as well as changes in earnings of the Minerals Management segment, working capital changes, capital expenditures, investments in royalty and mineral interests and changes in income taxes, as well as other factors. Cash flow before financing activities in 2020 included a significant use of cash related to changes in working capital, capital expenditures and the acquisition of mineral royalty interests. The Company anticipates positive cash flow before financing activities in 2021 but at a level still below the cash generated in 2019. Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $46 million in 2021.
Significant uncertainties remain regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company going forward will depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to the extent of new outbreaks, the extent to which additional stay-at-home orders may be imposed, the nature of the government public health guidelines and the public's adherence to those guidelines, the success of businesses reopening fully, the timing for proven treatments and the availability of vaccines for COVID-19. While the Company's existing mining operations to date have not been materially affected by the

pandemic, future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, could significantly and rapidly cause a deterioration in the Company’s results, supply chain channels and customer demand.
Growth and Diversification
The Company is pursuing growth and diversification by strategically leveraging its core mining and natural resources management skills to build a strong portfolio of affiliated businesses.
NAMining is pursuing growth and diversification by expanding the scope of its business development activities to include potential customers who require a broad range of minerals and materials and by leveraging the Company’s core mining skills to expand the range of contract mining services it provides. In addition, NAMining is pursuing opportunities to provide comprehensive mining services to operate entire mines when appropriate, as is the case at the new lithium project in Nevada.
The Minerals Management segment continues its efforts to grow and diversify by pursuing acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests in the United States, in what the Company believes is a buyer-friendly market. Once mineral and royalty interests have been acquired, the Minerals Management segment will benefit from the continued development of its mineral properties without additional capital investment. This business model can deliver higher average operating margins over the life of a reserve than traditional oil and gas companies that bear the cost of exploration, production and/or development.
MRNA continues to expand its business, which creates and sells stream and wetland mitigation credits and provides services to those engaged in permittee-responsible mitigation. This business offers opportunity for growth and diversification in an industry where the Company has substantial knowledge and expertise and a strong reputation. The MRNA business has achieved several successes and is positioned for additional growth.
The Company also continues to pursue activities which can strengthen the resiliency of its existing coal mining operations. The Company remains focused on managing coal production costs and maximizing efficiencies and operating capacity at mine locations to help customers with management fee contracts be more competitive. These activities benefit both customers and the Company's Coal Mining segment, as fuel cost is a significant driver for power plant dispatch. Increased power plant dispatch results in increased demand for coal by the Coal Mining segment's customers.
The Company continues to look for opportunities to expand its coal mining business where it can apply its management fee business model to assume operation of existing surface coal mining operations in the United States. However, opportunities are very limited in the current environment. Low natural gas prices and growth in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are likely to continue to unfavorably affect the amount of electricity dispatched from coal-fired power plants. In addition, the political and regulatory environment is not receptive to development of new coal-fired power generation projects which would create opportunities to build and operate new coal mines.
The Company is committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure while it grows and diversifies without unnecessary risk, which will allow for strategic growth and increased free cash flow to re-invest in and expand the businesses. The Company also continues to maintain the highest levels of customer service and operational excellence, with an unwavering focus on safety and environmental stewardship.
