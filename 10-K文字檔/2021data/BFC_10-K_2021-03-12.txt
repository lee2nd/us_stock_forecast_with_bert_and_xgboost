ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods. We are a bank holding company and we conduct all of our material business operations through the Bank. As a result, the discussion and analysis above relates to activities primarily conducted at the Bank level.
We have made, and will continue to make, various forward-looking statements with respect to financial and business matters. Comments regarding our business that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures, see the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Annual Report.
OVERVIEW
Bank First Corporation is a Wisconsin corporation that was organized primarily to serve as the holding company for Bank First, N.A. Bank First, N.A., which was incorporated in 1894, is a nationally-chartered bank headquartered in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. It is a member of the Federal Reserve, and is regulated by the OCC. Including its headquarters in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, the Bank has 22 banking locations in Manitowoc, Outagamie, Brown, Winnebago, Sheboygan, Waupaca, Ozaukee, Monroe, and Jefferson counties in Wisconsin. The Bank offers loan, deposit and treasury management products at each of its banking locations.
As with most community banks, the Bank derives a significant portion of its income from interest received on loans and investments. The Bank’s primary source of funding is deposits, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing. In order to maximize the Bank’s net interest income, or the difference between the income on interest-earning assets and the expense of interest-bearing liabilities, the Bank must not only manage the volume of these balance sheet items, but also the yields earned on interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. To account for credit risk inherent in all loans, the Bank maintains an ALLL to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. The Bank establishes and maintains this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against operating earnings. Beyond its net interest income, the Bank further receives income through the net gain on sale of loans held for sale as well as servicing income which is retained on those sold loans. In order to maintain its operations and bank locations, the Bank incurs various operating expenses which are further described within the “Results of Operations” later in this section.
The Bank is a 49.8% member of a data processing subsidiary, UFS, LLC, which provides core data processing, endpoint management cloud services, cyber security and digital banking solutions for over 60 Midwest banks. The Bank, through its 100% owned subsidiary TVG Holdings, Inc., also holds a 40% (up from 30% due to a purchase of member interest on October 1, 2019) ownership interest in Ansay & Associates, LLC, an insurance agency providing clients primarily located in Wisconsin with insurance and risk management solutions. These unconsolidated subsidiary interests contribute noninterest income to the Bank through their underlying annual earnings.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total consolidated assets of $2.72 billion, total loans of $2.19 billion, total deposits of $2.32 billion and total stockholders’ equity of $294.9 million. The Company employs approximately 314 full-time equivalent employees and has an assets-to-FTE ratio of approximately $8.7 million. For more information, see the Company’s website at www.bankfirstwi.bank.
Recent acquisitions
On July 12, 2019, the Company completed a merger with Partnership, a bank holding company headquartered in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger, dated as of January 22, 2019 and as amended on April 30, 2019, by and among the Company and Partnership, whereby Partnership merged with and into the Company, and Partnership Bank, Partnership’s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, merged with and into the Bank. Partnership’s principal activity was the ownership and operation of Partnership Bank, a state-chartered banking institution that operated four (4) branches in Wisconsin at the time of closing. The merger consideration totaled approximately $49.6 million.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Partnership shareholders had the option to receive either 0.34879 shares of the Company’s common stock or $17.3001 in cash for each outstanding share of Partnership common stock, and cash in lieu of any remaining fractional share. The stock versus cash elections by the Partnership shareholders were subject to final consideration being made up of approximately $14.3 million in cash and 534,659 shares of Company common stock, valued at approximately $35.3 million (based on a value of $66.03 per share on the closing date).
On May 15, 2020, the Company completed a merger with Timberwood, a bank holding company headquartered in Tomah, WI, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger, dated as of November 20, 2019, by and among the Company and
Timberwood, whereby Timberwood was merged with and into the Company, and Timberwood Bank, Timberwood's wholly owned banking subsidiary, was merged with and into the Bank. Timberwood's principal activity was the ownership and operation of Timberwood Bank, a state-chartered banking institution that operated one (1) branch in Wisconsin at the time of closing. The merger consideration totaled approximately $29.8 million.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Timberwood shareholders received 5.1445 shares of the Company's common stock for each outstanding share of Timberwood common stock, and cash in lieu of any remaining fractional share. Company stock issued totaled 575,641 shares valued at approximately $29.4 million, with cash of $0.4 million comprising the remainder of merger consideration.
The Company accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting, and thus, the financial position and results of operations of Partnership and Timberwood prior to the consummation date were not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accounting required assets purchased and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company determined the fair value of core deposit intangibles, securities, premises and equipment, loans, other assets and liabilities, deposits and borrowings with the assistance of third party valuations, appraisals, and third party advisors. The estimated fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the consummation as additional information becomes available relative to the closing date fair values.
COVID-19
During the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization and a National Public Health Emergency was declared in the United States. Shortly before the end of March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Wisconsin and of most other states took preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These preventative and protective actions within Wisconsin were lifted during May 2020, but continued uncertainty remains as future actions may be warranted based on the progression of the pandemic.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade, travel, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the economy by supporting individuals and businesses through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of relief. The CARES Act also included provisions to encourage financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law. This second coronavirus relief package granted additional funds for a new round of PPP loans. Additionally, it expanded the eligibility for loans and allows certain businesses to request a second loan.
Under the CARES Act, banks may elect to deem that loan modifications do not result in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") if they are (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency declaration or (B) December 31, 2020. Additionally, in accordance with the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised), other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. This includes short-term (e.g. up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Loans modified under this guidance are not considered TDRs.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets. We have actively reached out to our customers to provide guidance, direction and assistance in these uncertain times. We also participated extensively in the PPP, under which we secured funding of approximately 1,875 loans totaling approximately $279.6 million, and continue that participation during the next phase of PPP that began during the first quarter of 2021.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP in the United States and general practices within the financial institution industry. Significant accounting and reporting policies are summarized below.
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). We recognize the full fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and immediately expense transaction costs. There is no separate recognition of the acquired ALLL on the acquirer’s balance sheet as credit related factors are incorporated directly into the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. If the amount of consideration exceeds the fair value of assets purchased less the fair value of liabilities assumed, goodwill is recorded. Alternatively, if the amount by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeds the fair value of liabilities assumed and consideration paid, a gain (bargain purchase gain) is recorded. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the statement of income from the effective date of the acquisition.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses-Originated
The ALLL is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense as losses are estimated to have occurred. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
Management regularly evaluates the ALLL using general economic conditions, our past loan loss experience, composition of the portfolio, credit worthiness of the borrowers, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, the assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective since it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.
The ALLL consists of specific reserves for certain impaired loans and general reserves for non-impaired loans. Specific reserves reflect estimated losses on impaired loans from management’s analyses developed through specific credit allocations. The specific credit reserves are based on regular analyses of impaired non-homogenous loans. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values. The general reserve is based on our historical loss experience which is updated quarterly. The general reserve portion of the ALLL also includes consideration of certain qualitative factors such as (1) changes in lending policies and/or underwriting practices, (2) national and local economic conditions, (3) changes in portfolio volume and nature, (4) experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, (5) levels of and trends in past-due and nonaccrual loans and quality, (6) changes in loan review and oversight, (7) impact and effects of concentrations and (8) other issues deemed relevant.
Management believes that the current ALLL is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the ALLL. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses-Acquired
The ALLL for acquired loans is calculated using a methodology similar to that described for originated loans. Performing acquired loans are subsequently evaluated for any required allowance at each reporting date. Such required allowance for each loan pool is compared to the remaining fair value discount for that pool. If greater, the excess is recognized as an addition to the allowance through a provision for loan losses. If less than the discount, no additional allowance is recorded. Charge-offs and losses first reduce any remaining fair value discount for the loan pool and once the discount is depleted, losses are applied against the allowance established for that pool.
For purchase credit impaired loans after an acquisition, cash flows expected to be collected are recast for each loan periodically as determined appropriate by management. If the present value of expected cash flows for a loan is less than its carrying value, impairment is reflected by an increase in the ALLL and a charge to the provision for loan losses. If the present value of the expected cash flows for a loan is greater than its carrying value, any previously established ALLL is reversed and any remaining difference increases the accretable yield which will be taken into income over the remaining life of the loan. Loans which were considered TDRs by the acquired institution prior to the acquisition are not required to be classified as TDRs in our consolidated financial statements unless or until such loans would subsequently meet our criteria to be classified as such, since acquired loans were recorded at their estimated fair values at the time of the acquisition.
Impaired Investment Securities
Unrealized gains or losses considered temporary and the noncredit portion of unrealized losses deemed other-than-temporary are reported as an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit related portion of unrealized losses deemed other-than-temporary is recorded in current period earnings. Realized gains or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are included in earnings. We evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. As part of such monitoring, the credit quality of individual securities and their issuers are assessed. In addition, management considers the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and that the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. Adjustments to market value that are considered temporary are recorded as a separate component of equity, net of tax. If an impairment of security is identified as other-than-temporary based on information available such as the decline in the credit worthiness of the issuer, external market ratings or the anticipated or realized elimination of associated dividends, such impairments are further analyzed to determine if a credit loss exists. If there is a credit loss, it will be recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the period of identification.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Intangible assets consist of the value of core deposits and mortgage servicing assets and the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets (“goodwill”). The value of core deposits is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized on a sum of the years digits basis over a period of one to ten years.
Mortgage servicing rights are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of mortgage loans with servicing retained. Servicing rights acquired through sale of financial assets are recorded based on the fair value of the servicing right. The determination of fair value is based on a valuation model and includes stratifying the mortgage servicing rights by predominant characteristics, such as interest rates and terms, and estimating the fair value of each stratum based on the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as costs to service, a discount rate, and prepayment speeds. Changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to earnings.
We perform a “qualitative” assessment of goodwill to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary on at least an annual basis. If it is determined, as a result of performing a qualitative assessment over goodwill, that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, management will perform an impairment test to determine if the carrying value of goodwill is realizable.
Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets (“DTA”) and liabilities are determined using the liability method. DTAs and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the current enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Provision (benefit) for deferred taxes is the result of changes in the DTAs and liabilities. Deferred taxes are reviewed quarterly and would be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the information available, it is more likely than not that some or all of the DTAs will not be realized.
Recent Accounting Developments
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Certain aspects of this ASU were updated in November 2018 by the issuance of ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. The main objective of the ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in the ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. During 2019 FASB issued ASU 2019-10 which delated the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for smaller, publicly traded companies, until interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. This delay applies to the Company as it was classified as a “Smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act as of the date ASU 2019-10 was enacted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on the consolidated financial statements, although the general expectation in the banking industry is that the implementation of this standard will result in higher required balances in the ALLL.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in this ASU were issued to address concerns over the cost and complexity of the two-step goodwill impairment test and resulted in the removal of the second step of the test. The amendments require an entity to apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new guidance does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This ASU is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the two-step goodwill impairment test and was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Upon adoption, the amendments were to be applied on a prospective basis and the entity was required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. This ASU clarifies the requirements for entities to reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of paragraph 310-20-35-33 of the stated subtopic for each reporting period. The ASU was published to clarify the Codification and correct its unintended application and will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning within those fiscal years, beginning after December 31, 2020. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as all premiums within our securities portfolio were already being amortized to the earliest call date prior to the implementation as required under subtopic 310-20.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
General. Net income increased $11.3 million, or 42.5%, to $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reasons for the increase in profitability were increased net interest and service charge income from the added scale as a result of the acquisitions of Partnership and Timberwood, significant growth in our loan portfolio through participation in PPP, and robust retail mortgage lending which led to a large increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market. This was offset by larger provisions for loan losses during 2020, as well as increased expenses related to personnel, facilities and data processing as part of the same added scale from the aforementioned acquisitions. 2020 profitability was further negatively impacted by higher losses on sales of foreclosed properties and a penalty related to the early extinguishment of long-term debt.
Net Interest Income. The management of interest income and expense is fundamental to our financial performance. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Company’s total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets). We seek to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk through our asset and liability policies. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. Our net interest margin can also be adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short-term investments.
Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased by $15.3 million to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on loans increased by $12.3 million, or 14.9%, from 2019 to 2020. Total average interest-earning assets increased to $2.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Bank’s net interest margin decreased 11 basis points to 3.84% for the year ended December 31, 2020, down from 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest Income. Total interest income increased $11.5 million, or 12.9%, to $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, up from $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As noted, the increase was primarily due to loan growth from the acquisitions of Partnership and Timberwood, as well as participation in PPP. The average balance of loans increased by $466.9 million during 2020.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $5.6 million, or 28.9%, to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, down from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by declines in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, falling 70 basis points from 1.57% to 0.87%. This decline was primarily the result of a significantly lower interest rate environment that developed through the first half of 2020.
Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits decreased by $5.4 million to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned lower interest rate environment, allowing the Company to significantly reduce crediting interest rates on non-time, interest-bearing deposit accounts. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1.50% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Provision for Loan Losses. Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. We establish an ALLL through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for loan losses is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of our ALLL and charging the shortfall or excess, if any, to the current quarter’s expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management’s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. The determination of the amount is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity.
We recorded a provision for loan losses of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Significant charge-offs occurring during the third quarter of 2019 necessitated increased provisions for loan losses during 2019. These charge-offs were the result of exiting certain relationships during that quarter which were originally acquired as part of the Waupaca transaction. Despite having significantly reduced charge-offs during 2020, economic uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic required a build-up of our ALLL, resulting in higher provision expense. The ALLL was $17.7 million, or 0.81% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 compared to $11.4 million, or 0.66% of total loans at December 31, 2019.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income is an important component of our total revenues. A significant portion of our noninterest income is associated with service charges and income from the Bank’s unconsolidated subsidiaries, Ansay and UFS. Other sources of noninterest income include loan servicing fees, gains on sales of mortgage loans, and other income from strategic alliances.
Noninterest income increased $10.9 million to $23.5 million in 2020 compared to $12.6 million in 2019. Service charges increased by $1.5 million, or 42.7%, from 2019 to 2020, the result of new markets and added scale from three acquisitions in slightly more than three years. Income from Ansay increased by $0.9 million as a result of modestly higher profitability at that organization as well as the increase in our ownership during October 2019. Loan servicing income and net gain on sales of mortgage loans increased by $0.9 and $3.9 million from 2019 to 2020, the result of a robust residential mortgage lending environment during 2020 spurred by historically low mortgage interest rates. Due to uncertainty about liquidity needs in financial markets during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company sold approximately $34.0 million in U.S. Treasury Securities during the second quarter of 2020, resulting in a gain on sale of securities of $3.2 million, an increase of $2.6 million over 2019. Finally, the Company recorded a $1.7 million gain on the sale of a branch location during December 2020, causing other noninterest income to increase year-over-year. The major components of our noninterest income are listed in the table below:
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $10.6 million to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, up from $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Year-over-year, personnel expense increased $4.4 million, or 19.1%, occupancy expense increased $0.9 million, or 22.3%, data processing increased $1.0 million, or 22.3%, outside service fees increased $1.1 million, or 35.2%, and amortization of intangibles increased $0.6 million, or 53.0% the result of added scale and expenses from acquisitions of Partnership and Timberwood during 2019 and 2020. Postage, stationary, and supplies increased by $0.3 million, or 47.6%, from 2019 to 2020 as a result of costs associated with the Company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company had sales of two large foreclosed properties scheduled to close late in the first quarter of 2020 which would have resulted in modest losses. Due to the economic turmoil that resulted during the last several weeks of that quarter, terms of these sales were negatively impacted. Rather than hold these properties heading into this time of uncertainty, the Company chose to accept the reduced terms, causing significant losses on these sales that were the primary components of $1.4 million in total losses on sales and valuations of other real estate owned, compared to gains of $0.1 million during 2019. Finally, during the second quarter of 2020 the Company paid off $30.0 million in borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago which had contractual maturities ranging from August 2022 through August 2024, resulting in prepayment penalties of $1.3 million, but saving the Company $1.7 million in interest over the next four years. The major components of our noninterest expense are listed in the table below.
Income Tax Expense. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting effective tax rates of 23.7% and 22.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2020 increased due to the fact that tax- exempt interest remained consistent year-over-year while other taxable components of income increased significantly.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
General. Net income increased $1.2 million, or 4.9%, to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary reason for the increase in profitability was increased net interest income from the added scale as a result of the acquisition of Partnership, which impacted the second half of 2019. This was offset by larger provisions for loan losses during 2019, which were required due to significant charge-offs related to exiting certain relationships which were obtained through the Waupaca acquisition.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased by $4.2 million to $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income on loans increased by $10.8 million, or 15.0%, from 2018 to 2019. Total average interest-earning assets increased to $1.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1.66 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Bank’s net interest margin increased 6 basis points to 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2019, up from 3.89% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Interest Income. Total interest income increased $11.2 million, or 14.4%, to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up from $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As noted, the increase was primarily due to loan growth from the acquisition of Partnership. The average balance of loans increased by $139.4 million during 2019. Interest income was also aided by a generally rising interest rate environment which occurred throughout 2018 and the first half of 2019.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.7 million, or 31.3%, to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up from $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by a $53.7 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, rising 32 basis points from 1.25% to 1.57%. As noted above, a generally rising interest rate environment occurred throughout 2018 and the first half of 2019. Interest expense from other borrowed funds decreased $0.9 million from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to a decrease of 57.8 million in the average balance of other borrowings year-over-year. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $5.5 million to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a higher interest rate environment along with elevated levels of interest-bearing deposits from the acquisition of Partnership, which impacted the second half of 2019. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 1.50% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 1.15% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Significant charge-offs occurring during the third quarter of 2019 necessitated increased provisions for loan losses during 2019. These charge-offs were the result of exiting certain relationships during that quarter which were originally acquired as part of the Waupaca transaction. These relationships were never anticipated to be long-term relationships for the Company, and this action had been foreshadowed since the transaction occurred during 2017.The ALLL was $11.4 million, or 0.66% of total loans, at December 31, 2019 compared to $12.2 million, or 0.86% of total loans at December 31, 2018.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $1.1 million to $12.6 million in 2019 compared to $11.5 million in 2018. Income from Ansay decreased by $0.3 million as a result of lower contingency income recorded during 2019 compared to 2018. As an insurance broker, Ansay’s profitability is subject to ongoing volatility due to variable claim history from year-to-year, which impacts the level of contingency income they receive. Income from UFS increased by $0.4 million from 2018 to 2019, the result of an increase in their customer base. Loan servicing income decreased by $0.9 million from 2018 to 2019. This decrease was the result of a negative valuation adjustment to the Bank’s mortgage servicing rights asset of $0.7 million during 2019 versus a positive valuation adjustment of $0.4 million during 2018. Offsetting this, however, was an increase of $0.8 million in gains on sales of mortgage loans on the secondary market year-over-year. Finally, a restructuring of the Bank’s investment portfolio during 2019 led to a gain on sale of investments of $0.9 million, an increase over a negligible loss during 2018. The major components of our noninterest income are listed in the table below:
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $3.1 million to $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up from $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Personnel expense increased $1.4 million, or 6.5%, year-over-year, the result of staffing four additional locations for the second half of 2019 after the Partnership acquisition. Equipment and data processing expense as well as amortization of intangibles also all increased significantly from 2018 to 2019 as a result of the Partnership acquisition. Outside service fees were also negatively impacted by the Partnership acquisition during 2019, but this impact was more than offset by the lack of expenses that were incurred during 2018 during the process of becoming an SEC registrant. Charitable contributions returned to normal levels during 2019 after seeing several large one-time contributions during 2018. The major components of our noninterest expense are listed in the table below.
Income Tax Expense. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting effective tax rates of 22.1% and 20.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2019 increased due to certain nondeductible expenses incurred as part of the Partnership acquisition.
NET INTEREST MARGIN
Net interest income represents the difference between interest earned, primarily on loans and investments, and interest paid on funding sources, primarily deposits and borrowings. Interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the amount of net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average rate earned on earning assets is the amount of annualized taxable equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities is equal to annualized interest expense as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities.
The following tables set forth the distribution of our average assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, and average rates earned or paid on a fully taxable equivalent basis for each of the periods indicated:
(1) Annualized on a fully taxable equivalent basis calculated using a federal tax rate of 21.
(2) Nonaccrual loans are included in average amounts outstanding.
(3) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
(4) Net interest margin represents net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following tables describe the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volumes (changes in average balance multiplied by prior year average rate) and (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (change in average interest rate multiplied by prior year average balance), while (iii) changes attributable to the combined impact of volumes and rates have been allocated proportionately to separate volume and rate categories.

FHLB borrowings and notes payable to other banks totaled $39.8 million and $10.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Subordinated debt decreased $1.1 million to $17.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $18.6 million at December 31, 2019.
Stockholders’ Equity. Total stockholders’ equity increased $64.6 million, or 28.1%, to $294.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $230.2 million at December 31, 2019.
LOANS
Our lending activities are conducted principally in Wisconsin. The Bank makes commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, residential real estate loans, and a variety of consumer loans and other loans. Much of the loans made by the Bank are secured by real estate collateral. The Bank’s commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower, with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral typically being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans are also often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment. Repayment of the Bank’s residential loans are generally dependent on the health of the employment market in the borrowers’ geographic areas and that of the general economy with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being typically viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default.
Our loan portfolio is our most significant earning asset, comprising 80.6%, 78.6% and 79.7% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio by originating quality commercial and consumer loans that comply with our credit policies and that produce revenues consistent with our financial objectives. We believe our loan portfolio is well-balanced, which provides us with the opportunity to grow while monitoring our loan concentrations.
Total loans increased $455.1 million, or 26.2%, to $2.19 billion as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.74 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2020 has been comprised of an increase of $142.6 million or 47.2% in commercial and industrial loans, an increase of $179.1 million or 22.0% in commercial real estate loans, an increase of $7.9 million or 6.0% in construction and development loans, an increase of $97.2 million or 21.7% in residential 1-4 family loans and an increase of $28.3 million or 70.7% in consumer and other loans. The increase in loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 is attributable to loans purchased as part of the Timberwood transaction along with significant commercial and industrial loan growth as a result of participating in PPP.
Total loans increased $307.8 million, or 21.6%, to $1.74 billion as of December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.43 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2019 has been comprised of an increase of $5.1 million or 1.7% in commercial and industrial loans, an increase of $144.8 million or 21.7% in commercial real estate loans, an increase of $71.4 million or 117.4% in construction and development loans, an increase of $79.9 million or 21.7% in residential 1-4 family loans and an increase of $6.7 million or 20.1% in consumer and other loans. The increase in loans during the year ended December 31, 2019 is attributable to loans purchased as part of the Partnership transaction along with modest organic loan growth. This was offset by a reduction in loans which were acquired as part of the Waupaca transaction, which were primarily poor quality, out-of-market loan relationships which were never intended to be a long-term part of the Bank’s portfolio.
The following table presents the balance and associated percentage of each major category in our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
Our directors and officers and their associates are customers of, and have other transactions with, the Bank in the normal course of business. All loans and commitments included in such transactions were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve more than normal risk of collection or present other unfavorable features. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, total loans outstanding to such directors and officers and their associates were $67.1 million and $68.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $54.7 million of additions and $56.2 million of repayments were made to these loans, compared to $27.9 million of additions and $43.4 million of repayments during the year ended December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, all of the loans to directors and officers were performing according to their original terms.
Loan categories
The principal categories of our loan portfolio are discussed below:
Commercial and Industrial (C&I). Our C&I portfolio totaled $445.0 million, $302.4million and $297.3 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and represented 20%, 17% and 21% of our total loans, respectively. C&I loans increased 47.2% during 2020, primarily as a result of loans made through PPP and secondarily as a result of the Timberwood acquisition. C&I loans increased 1.7% in 2019. C&I loans increased 12.8% during 2018 due to the increased business needs of customers in our markets in response to strong economic conditions in those markets.
Our C&I loan customers represent various small and middle-market established businesses involved in professional services, accommodation and food services, health care, financial services, wholesale trade, manufacturing, distribution, retailing and non-profits. Most clients are privately owned with markets that range from local to national in scope. Many of the loans to this segment are secured by liens on corporate assets and the personal guarantees of the principals. The regional economic strength or weakness impacts the relative risks in this loan category. There is little concentration in any one business sector, and loan risks are generally diversified among many borrowers.
Commercial Real Estate (CRE). ur CRE loan portfolio totaled $992.2 million, $813.1 million and $668.3 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and represented 45%, 47% and 47% of our total loans, respectively. Our CRE loans increased 22.0% during 2020, primarily as a result of the Timberwood acquisition. Our CRE loans increased 21.7% during 2019 due primarily to the Partnership acquisition. Our CRE loans increased 3.8% during 2018 due to modest organic loan growth spurred by the business needs of customers in our markets, offset by a planned reduction in out-of-market CRE loans acquired in the Waupaca acquisition that was planned at the time of acquisition
Our CRE loans are secured by a variety of property types including multifamily dwellings, retail facilities, office buildings, commercial mixed use, lodging and industrial and warehouse properties. We do not have any specific industry or customer concentrations in our CRE portfolio. Our commercial real estate loans are generally for terms up to twenty years, with loan-to-values that generally do not exceed 85%. Amortization schedules are long term and thus a balloon payment is generally due at maturity. Under most circumstances, the Bank will offer to rewrite or otherwise extend the loan at prevailing interest rates.
Construction and Development (C&D). Our C&D loan portfolio totaled $140.1 million, $132.2 million and $60.8 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and represented 7%, 8% and 4% of our total loans, respectively. C&D loans increased 6.0% during 2020. C&D loans increased 117.4% during 2019 due to a combination of loans acquired in the Partnership acquisition and strong development in both owner-occupied and multifamily developments in our markets due to a continued strong economy. C&D loans decreased 19.8% during 2018 as a result of targeted efforts to reduce this type of lending as it had approached an internally set maximum allowable percentage to regulatory capital during 2017.
Our C&D loans are generally for the purpose of creating value out of real estate through construction and development work, and also include loans used to purchase recreational use land. Borrowers typically provide a copy of a construction or development contract which is subject to bank acceptance prior to loan approval. Disbursements are handled by a title company. Borrowers are required to inject their own equity into the project prior to any note proceeds being disbursed. These loans are, by their nature, intended to be short term and are refinanced into other loan types at the end of the construction and development period.
Residential 1-4 Family. Our residential 1-4 family loan portfolio totaled $545.8 million, $448.6 million and $368.7 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and represented 25%, 26% and 26% of our total loans, respectively. Residential 1-4 family loans increased 21.7% during 2020 primarily as a result of the Timberwood transaction. Residential 1-4 family loans increased 21.7% during 2019 primarily as a result of the Partnership transaction. Residential 1-4 family loans decreased 2.3% during 2018 as a result of an overall slowdown in the residential mortgage lending environment.
We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. One-to-four family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In addition, we also offer loans above conforming lending limits typically referred to as “jumbo” loans. These loans are typically underwritten to the same guidelines as conforming loans; however, we may choose to hold a jumbo loan within its portfolio with underwriting criteria that does not exactly match conforming guidelines.
We do not offer reverse mortgages nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We also do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation).
Residential real estate loans are originated both for sale to the secondary market as well as for retention in the Bank’s loan portfolio. The decision to sell a loan to the secondary market or retain within the portfolio is determined based on a variety of factors including but not limited to our asset/liability position, the current interest rate environment, and customer preference. Servicing rights are retained on all loans sold to the secondary market.
We were servicing mortgage loans sold to others without recourse of approximately $612.7 million, $554.4 million and $316.5 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Loans sold with the retention of servicing assets result in the capitalization of servicing rights. Loan servicing rights are included in other assets and are subsequently amortized as an offset to other income over the estimated period of servicing. The net balance of capitalized servicing rights amounted to $3.7 million, $4.3 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Consumer Loans. Our consumer loan portfolio totaled $ million, $27.0 million and $33.6 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and represented and represented 1%, 2%, and 2% of our total loans, respectively. Consumer loans include secured and unsecured loans, lines of credit and personal installment loans. Our consumer loans increased by 3.0% during 2020. Our consumer loans increased by 9.8% during 2019. Our consumer loans decreased by 19.7% during 2018 due to one loan totaling $7.6 million, secured by a trust, which was paid in full when the trust grantor passed away.
Consumer loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner-occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan repayments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
Other Loans. Our other loans totaled $37.9 million, $10.4 million and $6.4 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are immaterial to the overall loan portfolio. The other loans category consists primarily of overdrawn depository accounts, loans utilized to purchase or carry securities and loans to nonprofit organizations.
Loan Portfolio Maturities.
The following tables summarize the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on their loan type and contractual terms to maturity at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tables do not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less.
The following tables summarize the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on whether the loan has a fixed or variable rate of interest and their contractual terms to maturity at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tables do not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less.
NONPERFORMING LOANS AND TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS
In order to operate with a sound risk profile, we focus on originating loans that we believe to be of high quality. We have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. When delinquencies in our loans exist, we rigorously monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. From time to time, we may modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help a borrower with a deteriorating financial condition stay current on their loan and to avoid foreclosure. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans or modify the interest rates on loans to rates that are below market rates. Furthermore, we are committed to collecting on all of our loans and, as a result, at times have lower net charge-offs compared to many of our peer banks. We believe that our commitment to collecting on all of our loans results in higher loan recoveries.
Our nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped, as well as loans that are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. The composition of our nonperforming assets is as follows:
At December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, impaired loans had specific reserves of $900,000, $840,000, $1,079,000, $281,000 and $225,000, respectively. Levels of specific reserves are dependent on the specific underlying impaired loans at any given time. Management has evaluated the aforementioned loans and other loans classified as nonperforming and believes that all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020.
Our nonperforming assets increased during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, primarily due to the Waupaca acquisition, which included $19.4 million of loans which were considered nonperforming. This increase in nonperforming assets was anticipated in conjunction with the Waupaca acquisition, and management has actively manage these relationships out of the Bank through pay downs, refinances with or sales of loans to other institutions, or foreclosure actions. As a result of these actions nonperforming assets declined sharply during 2019. Nonperforming assets trended back up slightly during 2020 primarily due to one commercial real estate loan totaling approximately $7.3 million which was moved to nonaccrual status when a major tenant declared bankruptcy and vacated the facility. Payments have continued to be made timely on this loan, and significant interest has been noted from potential tenants to fill this vacancy.
Nonaccrual Loans
Loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when any payment of principal and/or interest is 90 days or more past due, unless the collateral is sufficient to cover both principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. Loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions, that the principal or interest will not be collectible in the normal course of business. We monitor closely the performance of our loan portfolio. In addition to the monitoring and review of loan performance internally, we have also contracted with an independent organization to review our commercial and retail loan portfolios. The status of delinquent loans, as well as situations identified as potential problems, is reviewed on a regular basis by senior management.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
A troubled debt restructuring includes a loan modification where a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we grant a concession to that borrower that we would not otherwise consider except for the borrower’s financial difficulties. These concessions may include modifications of the terms of the debt such as deferral of payments, extension of maturity, reduction of principal balance, reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments, or a combination of these concessions. Debt may be bifurcated with separate terms for each tranche of the restructured debt. Restructuring a loan in lieu of aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit the Company by increasing the ultimate probability of collection.
A TDR may be either on accrual or nonaccrual status based upon the performance of the borrower and management’s assessment of collectability. If a TDR is placed on nonaccrual status, which would occur based on the same criteria as non-TDR loans, it remains there until a sufficient period of performance under the restructured terms has occurred at which it returned to accrual status, generally 6 months.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law. Under the CARES Act, banks may elect to deem that loan modifications do not result in TDRs if they are (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency declaration or (B) December 31, 2020. Additionally, in accordance with the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised), other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. This includes short-term (e.g. up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Loans modified under this guidance are not considered TDRs and as such are not identified in the table below. During 2020, the Company granted payment deferrals to over 625 customers on loans totaling over $271 .5 million. These deferrals were primarily for lengths in the range of 60 to 180 days, and were a combination of deferrals of principal payments only or both principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2020, these totals had decreased to fewer than 20 loans with total balances less than $20.0 million.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had specific reserves of $0 and $80,000 for TDRs, respectively, and none of them have subsequently defaulted.
Classified loans
Accounting standards require the Company to identify loans, where full repayment of principal and interest is doubtful, as impaired loans. These standards require that impaired loans be valued at the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or using one of the following methods: the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We have implemented these standards in our quarterly review of the adequacy of the ALLL, and identify and value impaired loans in accordance with guidance on these standards. As part of the review process, we also identify loans classified as watch, which have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention.
Loans totaling $50.1 million and $60.3 million were classified substandard under the Bank’s policy as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table sets forth information related to the credit quality of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES
ALLL represents management’s estimate of probable and inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. Estimating the amount of the ALLL require the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows or impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogenous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of other qualitative factors such as current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset on the consolidated balance sheets. Loan losses are charged off against the ALLL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management’s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors.
The ALLL consists of specific reserves for certain individually evaluated impaired loans and general reserves for collectively evaluated non-impaired loans. Specific reserves reflect estimated losses on impaired loans from management’s analyses developed through specific credit allocations. The specific reserves are based on regular analyses of impaired, non-homogenous loans greater than $250,000. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values. The general reserve is based in part on the Bank’s historical loss experience which is updated quarterly. The general reserve portion of the ALLL also includes consideration of certain qualitative factors such as (1) changes in lending policies and/or underwriting practices, (2) national and local economic conditions, (3) changes in portfolio volume and nature, (4) experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, (5) levels of and trends in past-due and nonaccrual loans and quality, (6) changes in loan review and oversight, (7) impact and effects of concentrations and (8) other issues deemed relevant.
There are many factors affecting the ALLL; some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. The process for determining the ALLL (which management believes adequately considers potential factors which might possibly result in credit losses) includes subjective elements and, therefore, may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect our earnings or financial position in future periods. Allocations of the ALLL may be made for specific loans but the entire ALLL is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off or for which an actual loss is realized. As an integral part of their examination process, various regulatory agencies review the ALLL as well. Such agencies may require that changes in the ALLL be recognized when such regulators’ credit evaluations differ from those of management based on information available to the regulators at the time of their examinations.
The following table summarizes the changes in our ALLL for the years indicated:
The level of charge-offs depends on many factors, including the national and regional economy. Cyclical lagging factors may result in charge-offs being higher than historical levels. The dollar amount of the ALLL increased primarily as a result of loan growth and changes in the portfolio composition. Although the allowance is allocated between categories, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses attributable to all loan categories. Management believes that the ALLL is adequate.
The following table summarizes an allocation of the ALLL and the related percentage of loans outstanding in each category for the periods below.
SOURCES OF FUNDS
General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our investment and lending activities. We continue to focus on growing core deposits through our relationship driven banking philosophy and community-focused marketing programs. We also borrow from the FHLB of Chicago to supplement cash needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled payments and prepayments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities and fee income and proceeds from the sales of loans and securities.
Deposits. Our current deposit products include non-interest bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificate of deposits. As of December 31, 2020, deposit liabilities accounted for approximately 85.4% of our total liabilities and equity. We accept deposits primarily from customers in the communities in which our branches and offices are located, as well as from small businesses and other customers throughout our lending area. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, quality customer service, and convenient locations and hours to attract and retain deposits. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current business strategies, market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals.
Total deposits were $2.32 billion, $1.84 billion and $1.56 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $715.6 million, $476.5 million and $448.8 million, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were $1.61 billion, $1.37 billion and $1.11 billion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, we had a total of $348.3million in certificates of deposit, including $19.2 million of brokered deposits, of which $7.5 million had remaining maturities of one year or less. Based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, we believe we will retain a large portion of these accounts upon maturity.
The following tables set forth the average balances of our deposits for the periods indicated:
Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or greater by maturity are as follows:
Retail certificates of deposit of $100,000 or greater totaled $154.1 million, $176.6 million and $198.4 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest expense on retail certificates of deposit of $100,000 or greater was $3.1 million, $3.5 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The following table sets forth certificates of deposit (including brokered deposits) classified by interest rate as of the dates indicated:
Borrowings
Deposits and investment securities for sale are the primary source of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes. However, we may also obtain advances from the FHLB, purchase federal funds and engage in overnight borrowing from the Federal Reserve, correspondent banks, or enter into repurchase agreements.
Securities sold under repurchase agreements
The Company has securities sold under repurchase agreements which have contractual maturities up to one year from the transaction date with variable and fixed rate terms. The agreements to repurchase require that the Company (seller) repurchase identical securities as those that are sold. The securities underlying the agreements are under the Company’s control.
The following table summarizes securities sold under repurchase agreements, and the weighted average interest rates paid:
Lines of credit and other borrowings
The Company’s other borrowings have historically consisted primarily of short-term FHLB of Chicago advances collateralized by a blanket pledge agreement on the Company’s FHLB capital stock and retail and commercial loans held in the Company’s portfolio. There were $23.3 million and $39.6 million of advances outstanding from the FHLB at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no advances outstanding from the FHLB as of December 31, 2018. From time to time the Company utilized short-term FHLB advances to fund liquidity during 2018.
The total loans pledged as collateral were $825.3 million, $815.2 million and $697.3 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Outstanding letters of credit from the FHLB totaled $0.8 million, $14.4 million and $55.0 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The following table summarizes short-term borrowings (borrowings with maturities of one year or less), which consist of borrowings from the FHLB, and the weighted average interest rates paid:
We maintained a $5.0 million line of credit with a commercial bank. At December 31, 2019 we had outstanding balances on this note of $5.0 million. Borrowings under this note carried interest at a variable rate with a floor of 3.50%, and were due in full on May 25, 2021. This agreement was terminated on July 22, 2020.
We also maintained a $5.0 million line of credit with another commercial bank. There were outstanding balances on this note of $5.0 million as of December 31, 2019. There were no advances on this note at December 31, 2018 or 2017. This note was not renewed when it matured on May 19, 2020.
The Corporation maintains a $7.5 million line of credit with another commercial bank, which was entered into on May 15, 2020. There were no outstanding balances on this note at December 31, 2020. Any future borrowings will require monthly payments of interest at a variable rate, and will be due in full on May 15, 2021.
During September 2017, the Company entered into subordinated note agreements with three separate commercial banks. The Company had up to twelve months from entering these agreements to borrow funds up to a maximum availability of $22.5 million. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had borrowed $11.5 million under these agreements. These notes were all issued with 10-year maturities, carry interest at a variable rate payable quarterly, are callable on or after the sixth anniversary of their issuance dates, and qualify for Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.
As part of the Partnership acquisition, the Company assumed a subordinated note agreement with an outstanding balance of $7.0 million, and a fair market value adjustment of $0.2 million. The note was set to mature on October 1, 2025, required quarterly interest-only payments at a rate of 7.1% prior to maturity, and could be prepaid without penalty on or after October 1, 2020. This note qualified for Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. This note was prepaid in full on October 1, 2020.
On July 22, 2020, the Company entered into subordinated note agreements with two separate commercial banks. The Company had through December 31, 2020, to borrow funds up to a maximum availability of $6.0 million under each agreement, or $12.0 million total. These notes were issued with 10-year maturities, carry interest at a fixed rate of 5.0% through June 30, 2025, and at a variable rate thereafter, payable quarterly. These notes are callable on or after January 1, 2026 and qualify for Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The Company had outstanding balances of $6.0 million under these agreements at December 31, 2020.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES
Our securities portfolio consists of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Securities are classified as held to maturity or available for sale at the time of purchase. Obligations of states and political subdivisions and mortgage-backed securities, all of which are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, make up the largest components of the securities portfolio. We manage our investment portfolio to provide an adequate level of liquidity as well as to maintain neutral interest rate-sensitive positions, while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue or excessive risk.
Securities available for sale consist of U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of states and political subdivision, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate notes. Securities classified as available for sale, which management has the intent and ability to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in stockholders’ equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of securities available for sale totaled $165.0 million and included gross unrealized gains of $8.0 million and gross unrealized losses of $0.1million at December 31, 2020. At December, 31 2019, the fair value of securities available for sale totaled $181.5 million and included gross unrealized gains of $3.4 million and gross unrealized losses of $0.2 million.
Securities classified as held to maturity consist of obligations of states and political subdivisions. These securities, which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. Securities held to maturity as of December 31, 2020 are carried at their amortized cost of $6.7 million. At December 31, 2019, securities held to maturity totaled $43.7 million and consisted of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions.
The Company recognized a net gain on sale of investment securities of $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recognized a net gain of $0.2 million on the sale of an investment previously classified as an “other investment” and also a net gain on sale of investment securities of $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recognized a net loss on sale of investment securities of $31,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table sets forth the fair value of available for sale investment securities, the amortized costs of held to maturity and the percentage distribution at the dates indicated:
The following tables set forth the composition and maturities of investment securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
(1) Weighted Average Yield is shown on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of 21%.
The Company evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) credit quality of individual securities and their issuers are assessed; (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (4) that the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.
As of December 31, 2020, six debt securities had gross unrealized losses, with an aggregate depreciation of 0.08% from our amortized cost basis. The largest unrealized loss percentage of any single security was 1.86% (or $74,000) of its amortized cost. This was also the largest unrealized dollar loss of any single security.
As of December 31, 2019, 20 debt securities had gross unrealized losses, with an aggregate depreciation of 0.11% from our amortized cost basis. The largest unrealized loss percentage of any single security was 1.87% (or $6,000) of its amortized cost. The largest unrealized dollar loss of any single security was $67,000 (or 1.46%) of its amortized cost.
RETURN ON AVERAGE EQUITY AND ASSETS
Over the past five years, we have consistently improved our profitability as a result of the success of our growth strategies to grow quality loans and low-cost deposits as well as the improving economic conditions in our markets during the periods indicated in the table below. The following table sets forth our ROAA, ROAE, dividend payout ratio and average shareholders’ equity to average assets ratio for the periods indicated:
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices. Our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than they would on industrial companies.
Liquidity. Liquidity is defined as the Company’s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its needs for day-to-day operations and material long and short-term commitments. Liquidity is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We are expected to maintain adequate liquidity at the Bank to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Our asset and liability management policy is intended to cause the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity and, therefore, enhance our ability to raise funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals and lending needs, maintain reserve requirements and otherwise sustain our operations.
We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of our short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity based on demand and specific events and uncertainties to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits. Our objective in managing liquidity is to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as to increase earnings enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace.
Our liquidity is maintained through investment portfolio, deposits, borrowings from the FHLB, and lines available from correspondent banks. Our highest priority is placed on growing noninterest bearing deposits through strong community involvement in the markets that we serve. Borrowings and brokered deposits are considered short-term supplements to our overall liquidity but are not intended to be relied upon for long-term needs. We believe that our present position is adequate to meet our current and future liquidity needs, and management knows of no trend or event that will have a material impact on the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels.
Capital Adequacy. Total shareholders’ equity was $294.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $230.2 million at December 31, 2019, and $174.3 million at December 31, 2018. Our total shareholders’ equity increased during 2020, 2019 and 2018 as a result of our profitability, reduced by dividends paid and common share repurchases. Growth in shareholders’ equity during 2020 and 2019 was further stimulated by the acquisitions of Timberwood and Partnership in these years, respectively.
Our capital management consists of providing adequate equity to support our current and future operations. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measure of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and the classifications are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulator in regards to risk weighting and other factors. See “Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements.”
The following table reflects capital ratios computed pursuant to the regulatory capital rules as applicable to the Company and the Bank. As a result of the Economic Growth Act, the Company is no longer required to comply with its risk-based capital rules. For more information, see “Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements.”
As previously mentioned, the Company carried $17.5 and $18.6 million of subordinated debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included in total capital for the Company in the tables above.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company has entered into contractual obligations and commitments. The following tables summarize the Company’s contractual cash obligations and other commitments by maturity at December 31, 2020:
We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK
We are party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments primarily include commitments to originate and sell loans, standby and direct pay letters of credit, unused lines of credit and unadvanced portions of construction and development loans. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these particular classes of financial instruments.
Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments, standby and direct pay letters of credit and unadvanced portions of construction and development loans is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
Our significant off-balance-sheet arrangements consist of the following:
● Unused lines of credit
● Standby and direct pay letters of credit
● Credit card arrangements
Off-balance sheet arrangement means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party, under which the registrant has (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract, (2) retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement, (3) any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, or (4) any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest.
Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of our customers. Standby and direct pay letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and are subject to our normal credit policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is obtained based on management’s credit assessment of the customer.
Loan commitments and standby and direct pay letters of credit do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements because while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at anytime, these commitments occasionally expire without being drawn upon. Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:
We closely monitor the amount of our remaining future commitments to borrowers in light of prevailing economic conditions and adjust these commitments as necessary. We will continue this process as new commitments are entered into or existing commitments are renewed.
Effects of Inflation
The effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from the effect on an industrial company. While a financial institution’s operating expenses, particularly salary and employee benefits, are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution consists largely of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, investments, loans, deposits and other borrowings, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does general inflation. For additional information regarding interest rates and changes in net interest income see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Sensitivity.” Inflation may have impacts on the Bank’s customers, on businesses and consumers and their ability or willingness to invest, save or spend, and perhaps on their ability to repay loans. As such, there would likely be impacts on the general appetite of banking products and the credit health of the Bank’s customer base.
Selected Quarterly Financial Data
The following is selected financial data summarizing the results of operations for each quarter in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
*Cumulative quarterly per share performance may not equal annual per share totals due to the effects of the amount and timing of capital increases. When computing earnings per share for an interim period, the denominator is based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the interim period, and not on an annualized weighted average basis. Accordingly, the sum of the quarters’ earnings per share data will not necessarily equal the year to date earnings per share data.
