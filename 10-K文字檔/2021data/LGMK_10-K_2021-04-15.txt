Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Recent Developments of the Company
Partial Waiver of PPP Loan
On March 19, 2021, the Company received notification from the SBA that LogicMark’s obligation to repay its PPP loan in the amount of $301,460 plus accrued interest has been waived. The Company has also submitted a waiver application regarding its PPP Loan balance of $45,000; however the Company has not yet received notification from the SBA that its obligation to repay has been waived.
Second Amendment to Credit Agreement
On February 8, 2021, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, LogicMark, LLC (“LogicMark”), entered into a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the senior Secured Credit Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2019, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”), with each financial institution from time to time party thereto as lender (the “Lenders”), and a senior secured lender, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, LogicMark made a $5,000,000 voluntary prepayment (the “Prepayment”) on its $16,500,000 aggregate principal amount term loan originally made by the Lenders to LogicMark pursuant to the Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan”) and the Agent agreed to accept (i) LogicMark’s payment of a prepayment premium in the amount of $125,000, which is equal to 2.5% of the Prepayment, rather than 5% of the Prepayment as required by the Credit Agreement, and (ii) an extension of the maturity date of the Term Loan to May 22, 2023. As a result of the Prepayment, LogicMark’s resulting loan balance on the Term Loan is approximately $5,752,127.
December 2020 and February 2021 Registered Direct Offerings; Elimination of Series D Preferred Stock
On December 18, 2020, pursuant to the December Purchase Agreement, we closed the December Offering of 1,515,151 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, the December Registered Direct Warrants and unregistered common stock purchase warrants of the Company exercisable for up to an aggregate of 5,060,606 shares of Common Stock, including the December Warrant, on December 18, 2020. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $2,000,000, before deducting offering expenses, and is using the net proceeds from the December Offering to fund further production and distribution of the Company’s new 4G product, finalize testing and the initial production run of the Company’s new WiFi Notify product, restructure the Company’s website to promote direct to consumer sales of its products, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In addition, investors subsequently converted all of their shares of Series D Preferred Stock into an aggregate of 3,030,303 shares of Common Stock and no shares of Series D Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding as a result of such conversion. As previously disclosed on our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on February 3, 2021, the Company filed a certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 1, 2021 eliminating and canceling all designations, rights, preferences and limitations of the Series D Preferred Stock, and all shares of Series D Preferred Stock resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock of the Company.
On February 3, 2021, pursuant to the January Purchase Agreement, we closed the February Offering of 1,476,016 shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the February Registered Direct Warrants and the February Warrants on February 2, 2021. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $4,000,000, before deducting offering expenses, and intends to use the net proceeds from the February Offering for working capital and liability reduction purposes. As of the date of this Report, all shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued in connection with the February Offering have been converted into an aggregate of 2,952,032 shares of Common Stock.
Warrant Exercise Agreement
On January 8, 2021, we entered into a Warrant Amendment and Exercise Agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with one of the investors which holds a common stock purchase warrant, dated April 4, 2019, previously issued by the Company to such investor exercisable for up to 2,469,136 shares of Common Stock (the “Original Warrant”). In consideration for each exercise of the Original Warrant that occurs within 45 calendar days of the date of the Amendment Agreement, in addition to the issuance of the shares of Common Stock issued to such investor upon such exercise, the Company agreed to deliver to such investor a new common stock purchase warrant exercisable for up to the number of shares of Common Stock that such investor would receive upon exercise of the Original Warrant (the “New Warrant”), which New Warrant would have an exercise price of $1.525 per share, which is equal to the average closing price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Amendment Agreement. The Amendment Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each of the Company and such investor.
Pursuant to the Amendment Agreement, as a result of such investor’s full exercise of the Original Warrant for 2,469,136 shares of Common Stock, we issued such investor a New Warrant exercisable for up to 2,469,136 shares of Common Stock at $1.525 per share. The New Warrant is exercisable at any time until the original expiration date of the Original Warrant, which is April 4, 2024. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the New Warrant are subject to traditional adjustment for stock splits, combinations, recapitalization events and certain dilutive issuances. The New Warrant is required to be exercised for cash; however, if during the term of the New Warrant there is not an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the New Warrant, then the New Warrant may be exercised on a cashless (net exercise) basis pursuant to the formula provided in the New Warrant. The Company intends to use the proceeds of such investor’s exercise of the Original Warrant for product development, working capital and liability reduction purposes.
Regaining Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements
As previously disclosed on our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on May 24, 2019, we received written notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the closing bid price of our Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) and had 180 calendar days from the date therein to regain compliance, which was extended due to the global market impact caused by COVID-19 to August 3, 2020. We subsequently received a further extension from Nasdaq requiring us to evidence a closing bid price of our Common Stock above $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive trading days by February 1, 2021.
As previously disclosed on our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on January 5, 2021, as a result of the closing bid price of our Common Stock having closed above $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive trading days prior to February 1, 2021, we received a letter from Nasdaq Stock, dated January 4, 2021 (the “Nasdaq Letter”), confirming that we have regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and are in compliance with other applicable requirements as required for listing on Nasdaq and this matter has closed. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Letter, Nasdaq’s Hearing’s Panel (the “Panel”) has imposed a monitoring period on us until July 5, 2021 (the “Monitoring Period”), pursuant to which we are required to notify the Panel in writing in the event that the closing bid price of our Common Stock falls below $1.00 on any trading day, and in the event we are not in compliance with any other applicable listing requirement. In the event that the closing bid price of our Common Stock is under $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days at any point during the Monitoring Period, the Panel will notify us that it will conduct a hearing with regards to such deficiency, after which we will have the opportunity to respond to the Panel. Our shares of Common Stock may, thereafter, be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of the obligations placed on us pursuant to the Nasdaq Letter or that even if we do that we will be able to continue to comply with Nasdaq’s listing standards in the future, including the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and if we fail to achieve compliance with all applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, our Common Stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019.
Revenue. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $11,442,803, compared to $17,137,301 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our revenues the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to LogicMark’s decreased sales volume resulting primarily from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8,200,729, compared to a gross profit of $12,768,806 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to LogicMark’s decreased sales volume resulting primarily from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $8,786,807 and consisted of research and development expenses of $1,108,934, selling and marketing expenses of $2,396,922 and general and administrative expenses of $5,280,951. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the research and development expenses related primarily to salaries and consulting services of $988,214. Selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries and consulting services of $489,106, amortization of intangibles of $761,815, freight charges of $524,481, merchant processing fees of $242,185, and sales commissions of $237,378.

Also included is $320,000 in cash and non-cash stock compensation to board members.
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $10,191,015 and consisted of research and development expenses of $1,208,536, selling and marketing expenses of $3,279,317 and general and administrative expenses of $5,703,162. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the research and development expenses related primarily to salaries and consulting services of $848,596. Selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries and consulting services of $734,752, amortization of intangibles of $761,815, freight charges of $658,889, merchant processing fees of $415,447, and sales commissions of $296,619. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of salaries and consulting services of $1,673,676, accrued management and employee incentives of $284,785, and legal, audit and accounting fees of $776,767. Also included is $240,205 in non-cash stock compensation to vendors, employees and board members.
Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $1,400,000 lower as compared to our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to the significant cost reductions and cost containment efforts implemented by the Company in 2019 and 2020. Excluding the significant legal fees and other public company expenses that we incurred in 2020 as a result of the two pending lawsuits and our proxy solicitation efforts; our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been lower by approximately by $3,000,000 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating (Loss) Profit. The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $586,078, compared with an operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $2,577,791. The significant unfavorable change in operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to the lower gross profit resulting primarily from LogicMark’s decreased sales volume resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic offset in part by lower operating expenses attributable to the significant cost reductions and cost containment efforts in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Provision for Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled a tax expense of $24,886, or (0.88)% of the loss before income taxes, which differed from the tax benefit at the 21% statutory rate of $596,421 primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled a tax benefit of $332,571, or 12.31% of the loss before income taxes, which differed from the tax benefit at the 21% statutory rate of $567,208 primarily due to state income taxes and book to tax differences on the loss on sale of Fit Pay, offset by changes in the valuation allowance.
Loss from Operations. The net loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,864,984, compared to $2,368,418 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to an operating loss of $586,078, interest expense of $2,254,020 and income tax expense of $24,886.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We generated an operating loss of $586,078 and a net loss from operations of $2,864,984 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and stockholders’ equity of $4,387,416 and $9,159,209, respectively. At December 31, 2020, our operations had a working capital deficiency of $578,797. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of $5,144,387 from the issuance of common stock and warrants, the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock and warrants and the exercise of common stock purchase warrants.
In addition, we also further reduced our operating expenses by approximately $1.4 million on an annual basis. These additional cost reduction efforts will significantly enhance our cash flow as we move forward into 2021.
Given our cash position at December 31, 2020 and our projected cash flow from operations, we believe that we will have sufficient capital to sustain operations for a period of one year following the date of this filing. We may also raise funds through equity or debt offerings to accelerate the execution of our long-term strategic plan to develop and commercialize our core products and to fulfill our product development commitments.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash of $4,387,416.

Our primary ongoing uses of operating cash relate to payments to subcontractors and vendors for research and development, salaries and related expenses and professional fees. Our vendors and subcontractors generally provide us with normal trade payment terms. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $412,959, which comprised a net loss of $2,864,984, positive adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities of $1,643,323 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of positive $808,702.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities totaled $2,001,429 and was primarily related to the pay down of $16,000,000 in term loan facility with Sagard Holdings Manager, LP, pay downs in both the short and long-term debt totaling $638,881, scheduled term loan repayments of $1,203,125 and fees paid in connection with equity offerings totaling $55,546. In addition, we also prepaid $1,988,498 of the term loan facility with a portion of the net proceeds received from the sale of our discontinued operations. These financing disbursements were funded in part with net proceeds received of $1,299,042 from the sale of stock from our January 2019 at-the-market offering, $1,915,000 from the sale of stock in connection with a registered direct public offering and $14,670,579 in net proceeds received from the refinancing with CrowdOut Capital, which closed on May 3, 2019.
Potential Impacts of COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations
The COVID-19 pandemic represents a fluid situation that presents a wide range of potential impacts of varying durations for different global geographies, including locations where we have offices, employees, customers, vendors and other suppliers and business partners.
Like most US-based businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the same began to have impacts on our business in March 2020. By that time, much of our first fiscal quarter was completed. During the period April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, we have observed decreases in demand from certain customers, primarily our VA hospitals.
Given the fact our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels, including through hospitals, we expect our sales will experience more volatility as a result of the changing and less predictable operational needs of many customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are aware that many companies, including many of our suppliers and customers, are reporting or predicting negative impacts from COVID-19 on future operating results. Although we observed significant declines in demand for our products from certain customers during the nine months ended December 31, 2020, we believe that COVID-19 had a significant impact on the demand for our products. We also cannot be certain how demand may shift over time as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may go through several phases of varying severity and duration.
In light of broader macro-economic risks and already known impacts on certain industries that use our products and services, we have taken and are taking targeted steps to lower our operating expenses because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations closely and this situation could change based on a significant number of factors that are not entirely within our control and are discussed in this and other sections of this Report. We do not expect there to be material changes to our assets on our balance sheet or our ability to timely account for those assets. Further, in connection with the preparation of this Report and the financial statements contained herein, we reviewed the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on goodwill and intangible assets and have determined there to be no material impact at this time. We have also reviewed the potential impacts on future risks to the business as it relates to collections, returns and other business-related items.
To date, travel restrictions and border closures have not materially impacted our ability to obtain inventory or manufacture or deliver products or services to customers. However, if such restrictions become more severe, they could negatively impact those activities in a way that would harm our business over the long term. Travel restrictions impacting people can restrain our ability to assist our customers and distributors as well as impact our ability to develop new distribution channels, but at present we do not expect these restrictions on personal travel to be material to our business operations or financial results. We have taken steps to restrain and monitor our operating expenses and therefore we do not expect any such impacts to materially change the relationship between costs and revenues.
Like most companies, we have taken a range of actions with respect to how we operate to assure we comply with government restrictions and guidelines as well as best practices to protect the health and well-being of our employees and our ability to continue operating our business effectively. To date, we have been able to operate our business effectively using these measures and to maintain internal controls as documented and posted. We also have not experienced challenges in maintaining business continuity and do not expect to incur material expenditures to do so. However, the impacts of COVID-19 and efforts to mitigate the same have remained unpredictable and it remains possible that challenges may arise in the future.
The actions we have taken so far during the pandemic include, but are not limited to:
● Requiring all employees who can work from home to work from home;
● Increasing our IT networking capability to best assure employees can work effectively outside the office;
● For employees who must perform essential functions in one of our offices:
&cir;
Having employees maintain a distance of at least six feet from other employees whenever possible;
&cir;
Having employees work in dedicated shifts to lower the risk all employees who perform similar tasks might become infected by COVID-19;
&cir;
Having employees stay segregated from other employees in the office with whom they require no interaction; and
&cir;
Requiring employees to wear masks while they are in the office whenever possible.
On each of May 6 and May 8, 2020, we and LogicMark, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, received loans (the “Loans”) from Bank of America, NA in the aggregate amount of $346,390, pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act. Under the terms of the PPP, PPP loans and accrued interest are forgivable after twenty-four weeks as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the eight-week period. As of December 31, 2020, we have used the entirety of the loan proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP and have not taken any actions that we believe will reduce the amount eligible for forgiveness. As such, the Company believes that the entire amount of the PPP loans will be eligible for forgiveness. However, to the extent any portion of the loan is determined to be ineligible for forgiveness, such unforgiven portion of the loan is payable over 2-5 years at an interest rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months.
Our revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2020 declined significantly year over year due to the conditions noted. In April 2020, we implemented a COVID-19 mitigation plan designed to further reduce our operating expenses. Actions taken to date include work hour and salary reductions for senior management. These cost reductions are in addition to the significant restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019. Based on our current cash position, our projected cash flow from operations and our cost reduction and cost containment efforts to date, we believe that we will have sufficient capital to sustain operations for a period of one year following the date of this filing. If business interruptions resulting from COVID-19 were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted. We will continue to actively monitor this situation and will implement actions necessary to maintain business continuity.
Business Outlook
Our future financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on conditions in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our results of operations as we experienced meaningful reductions in customer demand for our products and services. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company continued to identify and assess risks and modify operating plans following guidance from national, state and local governmental and health authorities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, although we continued to experience minimal supply chain disruption, customer demand was noticeably weaker. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we took several proactive measures to protect the Company’s balance sheet and strengthen its liquidity position, including: making additional cost reductions through executive wage rollbacks, discretionary spending reductions, corporate travel suspension, and service provider and other expense reductions as well as leveraging government work programs and tax deferrals and extensions to the extent they do not incur interest rate fees or penalties.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the economic environment remain extremely fluid and it is difficult to predict with certainty what unforeseen circumstances may develop as we progress through the remainder of the year. As a result, we will continue to proceed cautiously by managing our cost structure and cash flows. In addition, we are rethinking our strategic plans to best position our company to adapt to these changing conditions and to continue to serve our customers and community.
COVID-19 Considerations
The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic are protecting the health and safety of our employees and rethinking and reevaluating our operational and strategic plans to overcome the current challenges. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material net impact on our consolidated operating results. In the future, the pandemic may cause continued or prolonged reduced demand for our products or services if, for example, the pandemic results in a recessionary economic environment to the markets that we serve; however since the products and services that we offer are essential to the daily lives of our current and future customers, we believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for our products and services as we rethink our distribution paradigm in the post-COVID-19 environment.
Our ability to operate without significant negative operational impact from the COVID-19 pandemic will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow the recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees, with particular measures in place for those working in our customer facilities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we maintained the consistency of our operations during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to innovate in managing our business. However, the uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our workforce and supply chain as well as impact the purchasing decisions by some of our larger customers.
During 2020, the pandemic has not materially impacted the Company’s liquidity position as of such date, however, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we failed to generate operating cash flow as we had in the first quarter of 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to maintain access to the capital markets should the effects of the pandemic on our operations continue. We have not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of our assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets each year, unless events occur which trigger the need for an interim impairment review. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company considered the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however because we were in the early stages of the pandemic, we elected not to undertake a formal review of our assets for impairment purposes.
During the third quarter of 2020, the Company, as part of its annual evaluation of goodwill, considered the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations and determined there was no triggering event, particularly inasmuch as the Company’s sales began to recover during the second half of the third quarter of 2020. The Company continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic on its business and anticipates continuing to review guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as well as governing audit bodies to guide its future reviews and posture.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three (3) years. However, inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in Asia, as well as the cost of certain raw materials, component parts and labor used in the production of our products. It also may increase our operating expenses, manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets. We have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent, price increases, and we expect to be able to do the same during 2021. As such, we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during 2021.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt, and we have not entered into any synthetic leases. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of our significant accounting policies.
Basis of Presentation. The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenues consist of product sales to either end customers or to distributors. The Company’s revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which are in most cases customer purchase orders. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk. Our contracts do not have any financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 days after delivery. The Company’s products are almost always sold at fixed prices. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to any refunds, due to product returns or adjustments due to volume discounts, rebates or price concessions to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. The Company’s sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when the Company ships or delivers the product from its fulfillment center to our customers, when our customers accepts and has legal title of the goods, and the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point, or (ii) when the product arrives at its destination. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, none of our sales were recognized over time.
Warranty Costs. The Company’s product is sold with a one-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. The Company accrues for the estimated costs associated with the one-year Wocket® warranty at the time revenue associated with the sale is recorded, and periodically updates its estimated warranty cost based on actual experience. Estimating warranty costs requires significant judgment. To date, warranty claims have been inconsequential and the Company estimates any such claims against sales made to date will be immaterial. Accordingly, no accrual for warranty costs has been recorded at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Inventory. The Company performs regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and evaluates the realizable value of its inventories. The Company will adjust the carrying value of the inventory as necessary with the estimated valuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory by comparing the individual inventory parts to forecasted product demand or production requirements. The inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method.
Convertible Instruments. The Company applies the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging and for distinguishing liabilities from equity when accounting for hybrid contracts that feature conversion options. The accounting standards require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (ii) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (iii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. The derivative is subsequently marked to market at each reporting date based on current fair value, with the changes in fair value reported in the results of operations.
Conversion options that contain variable settlement features such as provisions to adjust the conversion price upon subsequent issuances of equity or equity linked securities at exercise prices more favorable than that featured in the hybrid contract generally result in their bifurcation from the host instrument.
The Company accounts for convertible debt instruments when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments in accordance with ASC 470-20 “Debt with Conversion and Other Options”. The Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying Common Stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt.
