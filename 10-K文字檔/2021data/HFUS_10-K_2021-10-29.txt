ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion and analysis were prepared to supplement information contained in the accompanying financial statements and is intended to explain certain items regarding the financial condition as of July 31, 2021, and the results of operations for the years ended July 31, 2021, and 2020. It should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in this report.
Overview of the Business
Hartford Great Health Corp. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008, under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 22, 2018, and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our business plan as set forth below.
Ability to continue as a “going concern”.
The independent registered public accounting firms’ reports on our financial statements as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, includes a “going concern” explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to the factors prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed in the financial statements, including footnotes thereto.
Plan of Operation
As of July 31, 2021, the company has issued a total of 100,108,000 shares of common stock. On December 11, 2018, 96,090,000 shares of common stock were issued at the price of $0.02 per share to raise an additional $1,921,800 in capital. On November 24, 2020, the Company issued additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a significant shareholder of the Company at $0.02 per share.
On December 28, 2018, the Company acquired Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd (“HZHF”). On March 22, 2019, the Company acquired 60 percent of Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. (“HZLJ”). On March 20, 2019, the Company acquired Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd. (“HFSH”) with 90 percent of Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency (“Qiao Garden Int’l Travel”), which was disposed on December 31, 2020, and formed a joint venture entity, Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd (“HF Int’l Education”).
The subsidiary of HFUS in Shanghai (HFSH) advances operating funds from two related party entities, SH Qiao Hong and SH Oversea Chinese Culture Media Ltd. The main purpose of the funding is to invest in Hartford International Education Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (HF Int’l Education). Upon signing of supplemental agreement, HFUS currently holds 75.5% ownership of HF Int’l Education and maintains control over HF Int’l Education. On July 24, 2019, HF Int’l Education established a 100% owned subsidiary, Pudong Haojin Childhood Education Ltd. (“PDHJ”). On October 28, 2019, PDHJ had its childhood education center opened. On March 23, 2020, HF Int’l Education established Shanghai Hongkou HaiDeFuDe Childcare Co., Ltd.(“HDFD”) and was approved the business license to conduct childcare operations in Shanghai, China. On July 20, 2020, HF Int’l Education entered an agreement with two individuals to acquire the whole ownership of Shanghai Gelinke Childcare Education Center (“Gelinke”). During the board meeting, SH Jingyu and another noncontrolling shareholders also sold a total of 14.5% equity at zero value to HFSH. As a result, HFSH holds 90% of HF Int’l Education and a total of 10% equity is held by two individual noncontrolling shareholders.
HF Int’l Education has developed an enhanced model of childcare franchise management program and registered a new brand name, “HaiDeFuDe”. HF Int’l Education has recruited a team of knowledgeable childcare teachers to develop series of independent textbooks designed to targeted age of young children and register for the copyrights for these textbooks in September of 2020. Since then, HF Int’l Education has begun marketing and promoting the enhanced model of franchise operation and management packaged program, under “HaiDeFuDe” brand, to an initial of 50 franchisees throughout different regions of China. To achieve that, HF Int’l Education has incorporated existing market resources throughout other major cities and provinces in China. The promotion of HF Int’l Education franchise operation and management model is expected to attract other childcare education centers to join the “HaiDeFuDe” brand, and HF Int’l Education expects to generate revenue from franchise and management fees.
Due to continued market uncertainties during the pandemic, the board of HFSH adopted a new management approach to ease cash flow and reduce operation loss. In March 2021, HF Int’l Education entered agreements with a third party, Hartford Health Management (Shanghai), Co. Ltd. (“HFHM”). HFHM purchased seven education & intellectual property copy rights and ten “HaiDeFuDe” registered trademarks from HF Int’l Education for a total amount of RMB1.2M and RMB1.0M, respectively. In June 2021, HF Int’l Education and its three subsidiaries entered license agreements with HFHM for the rights to use the intellectual Properties (the “IPs”) HFHM owns. The IPs cover in the license agreements are four sets of curriculum structure designed and fifteen trademarks including “HaiDeFuDe” registered trademarks purchased from HF Int’l Education. As a return, on a monthly basis, HF Int’l Education and its subsidiaries pays 90% of its tuition revenue generated to HFHM as license usage fee.
After further ease of restrictions from the pandemic, the Company will re-run special franchise promotion. There will be a great reduction in franchise fees for the first twenty childcare center that join “HaiDeFuDe” brand. In doing so, the Company expect to generate a revised revenue of RMB16,000,000 from 50 franchisees by the end of 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of July 31, 2021, we had negative working capital of $6,927,145 comprised of current assets of $990,088 and current liabilities of $7,917,233. This represents a decrease of $3,567,522 in the working capital balance from the July 31, 2020 negative amount of $3,359,623. During the year-ended July 31, 2021, our working capital deficit increased primarily because we recognized $2,508,959 current operating lease liabilities by adopting ASU No. 2016-02, and additional advances from related parties for business operating.
We believe that our funding requirements for the next twelve months will be in excess of $1,600,000. We are currently seeking for further funding through related parties’ loan and finance.
On December 11, 2018, the Company sold 96,090,000 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”) to 15 individuals. The selling price was $0.02 per share for an aggregate of $1,921,800. All 15 investors executed subscription agreements. As of April 30, 2019, all proceeds have collected. Twelve of the 15 investors are Chinese citizens and purchased the shares in China. Due to the strict monitoring of China’s foreign exchange investment policy, funds are not able to be transferred directly to HFUS. As a result, amount of $657,000 were collected in RMB from the Chinese investors. The Shares were sold in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Section 4(2) and/or Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Shares are all restricted shares and accordingly all stock certificates evidencing the Shares have been affixed with the appropriate legend restricting sales and transfers.
On November 24, 2020, the Company issued additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a significant shareholder of the Company at $0.02 per share.
We will seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any needed financing on favorable terms, or at all, or that we will find qualified purchasers for the sale of our stock. Any sales of our securities would dilute the ownership of our existing investors.

Investing activities
Cash used in investing activities was $185,682 for the year ended July 31, 2021 as compared to $52,270 cash provided by investing activities for the corresponding period in 2020.
During the year ended July 31, 2021, HF Int’l Education acquired a new entity, Gelinke with cash net inflow of $ 12,721, HFSH disposed its 90 percent owned subsidiary - Qiao Garden Int’l Travel with cash net outflow of $30,116, and Property and equipment purchases of $168,287.
During the year ended July 31, 2020, $323,078 loan receivable and interest have been paid back from third party borrowers. HF Int’l Education’s subsidiary, Pudong Haojin Childhood Education Ltd. (“PDHJ”) was opened to provide childcare education services. Property and equipment, amount of $270,808, have been added to this new entity.
Financing activities
Cash provided by financing activities was $2,549,984 for the year ended July 31, 2021 as compared to $1,117,796 for the year ended July 31, 2020. The cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended July 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to $2,407,033 funding support from related parties, $145,000 notes payable from one related party, $20,000 proceeds from stock issuance, offset by $22,049 finance lease principal payment.
The cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended July 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to $953,236 funding support from related party-Shanghai Oversea Chinese Culture Media Ltd., $184,438 contribution received from noncontrolling interest shareholders to the joint venture entity - HF Int’l, offset by $19,878 finance lease principal payment.
Equity and Capital Resources
We have incurred losses since inception of our business and, as of July 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $5,821,519 compared to $3,568,185 at the previous year end. To date, we have funded our operations through short-term debt and equity financing.
We expect our expenses might increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operational expenses and the development of our business. As our Chinese subsidiaries start operations and marketing plans, the three childcare education centers have begun to generate limited revenues during the pandemic. However, the generated revenue is not expected to be sufficient to cover our marketing needs until the end of 2022 due to the uncertainties affected by the pandemic. Consequently, we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of additional capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate.
Future Capital Expenditures
On January 2019, HFSH entered an agreement to acquire 100 percent equity interest of Shanghai Luo Sheng International Trade Ltd. (“SH Luosheng”). As of July 31, 2021, the agreement has not yet taken effective as no consideration has been paid toward those acquisitions. The agreement will be executed when the Company is financially ready to move forward, and the purchase price will be calculated based on the net assets of each entity on execute dates. There was no penalty levied or to be levied due to delayed execution or inexecution of this agreement.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of and subsequent to July 31, 2021, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Commitments
As of July 31, 2021, we have no other material contractual commitments except the office building and property leases which are included Note 13 Leases. (see note 16. Commitments and contingencies)
Results of Operations- Year Ended July 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended July 31, 2020
Revenue and Cost of revenue: We recognized $553,459 and $98,307 revenue in the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost of revenue increased to $308,413 for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared to $86,243 during the comparable period of 2020. The revenue during both years was mainly generated from two industry segments: hospitality housing in HZLJ and childhood education care services in HF Int’l Education.
Operating Expenses: Operating expenses decreased to $3,261,411 for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared to $3,511,021 during the comparable period of 2020. During the year ended July 31, 2021, the decrease of $249,610 was resulted from the decrease of impairment loss by $1,557,792, offset by the increase of the selling, general and administrative expenses by $1,293,020 and the increase of depreciation and amortization expenses by $15,162. The increase of selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly resulted from the expenses incurred in the new operating subsidiaries in China for childcare education business development, including lease cost. The company’s major business plans were halted during COVID-19 pandemic. Management determined that $1,006,343 goodwill and $621,963 deferred cost of finance lease which were generated from acquisitions were fully impaired as of July 31, 2020. Management further determined that $70,514 goodwill generated from Gelinke acquisition was fully impaired as of July 31, 2021.
Other Income (Expense): Other income, net increased to $174,826 for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared to $155,312 of other expense for the corresponding period of 2020. Other income for the year ended July 31, 2021 was mainly resulted from $108,366 lease payable write-off as a result of the legal settlement (see note 16. Commitments and contingencies), $104,317 gain on disposal of subsidiary, $334,537 income realized from the trademark and copy rights transfer to a related party, offset by $403,131 loss from HF Int’l Education’s ownership restructure in 2021 (see note 4 Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Deconsolidation). Other expense for the year ended July 31, 2020, was mainly resulted from $141,984 donation made to Shanghai JiaoTong University Oversea Early Childcare Organization.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: For the year ended July 31, 2021, we recorded a net loss attributable to Noncontrolling interest of $589,005 compared to $1,003,700 for the corresponding period of 2020. The decrease was mainly resulted from HF Int’l Education’s ownership restructure, noncontrolling interest has been reduced from 24.5% to 10% in 2021. The loss was allocated based on the ownership percentage of noncontrolling interest, which was mainly acquired through the acquisitions and Joint Ventures.
Net Loss Attributable to Hartford Great Health Corp: We recorded a net loss of $2,253,334 or $ (0.02) per share for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $2,651,369 or $ (0.03) per share for the year ended July 31, 2020, a decrease in losses of $398,035 due to the factors discussed above.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the identification and disclosure of impaired assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency: The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. The Company does not undertake hedging transactions to cover its foreign currency exposure.
Comprehensive Income (loss): For the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company included its foreign currency translation gain or loss as part of its comprehensive income (loss).
Fair value measurement: Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or funds.
Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, related party receivable, prepaid and other current receivable, accounts payable, related party payable and other current payable. The carrying amounts of afore-mentioned accounts approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company maintains cash with banks in the USA and China. Should any bank holding cash become insolvent, or if the Company is otherwise unable to withdraw funds, the Company would lose the cash with that bank; however, the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts. In China, a depositor has up to RMB500,000 insured by the People’s Bank of China Financial Stability Bureau (“FSD”). In the United States, the standard insurance amount is USD250,000 per depositor in a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, none of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by financial institutions was uninsured. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company generally does not require collateral and does not have an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Receivables: The Company evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s or borrower’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, all balances are collectable based on management’s assessment.
Property and equipment, net: Property and equipment, net, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Goodwill and Long-lived Assets: Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, is not amortized, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
The Company has the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The Company’s goodwill was mainly generated from the acquisitions during the year ended July 31, 2019. We currently have two reporting units - Hospitality and Early Childhood Education. Given the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the unfavorable operation results, an interim goodwill impairment assessment was performed as of January 31, 2020. Based on the assessment result, management determined that the goodwill generated from 2019 acquisitions was fully impaired as of January 31, 2020. The goodwill balance as of July 31, 2021 was generated from Gelinke acquisition in 2021.
Business Combinations: If an acquired set of activities and assets is capable of being operated as a business consisting of inputs and processes from the viewpoint of a market participant, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are a business. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date. Fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. In determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition, the Company may utilize appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or may complete some or all of the valuations internally. In either case, the Company takes full responsibility for the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill reflects the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received. Acquisition-related costs that the Company incurs to affect a business combination are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
Noncontrolling interest: The Company adopted ASC 810, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, as of January 1, 2009. ASC 810 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. ASC 810 also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owner.
Advertising costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, amount of $ 65,406 and $12,582 advertising expenses were incurred, respectively.
Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act also creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”)) earned by controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”) must be included in the gross income of the CFCs’ U.S. shareholder income. The tax law in PRC applies an income tax rate of 25% to all enterprises. The Company’s subsidiary does not receive any preferential tax treatment from local government. The Company has been in loss position for years and zero balances of tax provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the reporting periods ended. The tax reforms have no significant impacts on the Company.
Revenue Recognition: The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606) on August 1, 2019, applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of August 1, 2019. The Company is building up its core business upon the completion of multiple acquisitions in March 2019 and impact of COVID-19 pandemic, limited operations occurred during the years ended July 31, 2021and 2020. The revenue during the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 was mainly generated from HZLJ and HF Int’l Education.
Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We follow the five steps approach for revenue recognition under Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. Billings to customers for which services are not rendered are considered deferred revenue. ASC 606 has no material impacts on the Company’s financial positions. The Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products or providing services to a customer. The Company’s general payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms.
a. Early childhood education services: HF Int’l Education generates revenue from childhood education classes provided to its customers. The educational services consist of parent-child and bilingual childcare classes. Each contract of educational classes is accounted for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied proportionately over the service period. Tuition fee is generally collected in advance and is initially recorded as deferred revenue and transferred to contract liabilities after trial period. Refunds are provided to parents if they decide within the trial period that they no longer want to take the class. After the trial period, if a parent withdraws from a class, usually only that unearned portion of the fee is available to be returned. For the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, $435,150 and $29,582, respectively, of revenue were derived from early childhood education classes provided.
b. Hospitality services: HZLJ generates revenue primarily from the room rentals, sale of food and beverage and other miscellaneous hospitality services. The Company recognizes room rental and services daily as services are provided. Under ASC 606, the pattern and timing of recognition of income from hotel facility is consistent with the prior accounting model.
Income (Loss) Per Share: Basic earnings per share include no dilution and are computed by dividing net income (or loss) by the weighted- average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of the Company, assuming the issuance of an equivalent number of common shares pursuant to options, warrants, or convertible debt arrangements. Diluted earnings per share are not shown for periods in which the Company incurs a loss because it would be anti-dilutive. Similarly, potential common stock equivalents are not included in the calculation if the effect would be anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive debt or equity securities were issued or outstanding during the year ended July 31, 2021 or 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill, but rather requires an entity to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on January 31, 2020. Management determined the goodwill generated from HZLJ and HFSH acquisition was fully impaired as of January 31, 2020.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. ASU No. 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The accounting for finance leases (capital leases) was substantially unchanged. The original guidance required application on a modified retrospective basis with adjustments to the earliest comparative period presented. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements to ASC 842,” which included an option to not restate comparative periods in transition and elect to use the effective date of ASU No. 2016-02 as the date of initial application, which the Company elected. As a result, the consolidated balance sheet prior to August 1, 2019 was not restated, and continues to be reported under previous guidance that did not require the recognition of operating lease liabilities and corresponding lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The cumulative effect of the changes made to our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 1, 2019 for the adoption of the new lease standard was as follows:
The adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 had an immaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of operation and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2020. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification, not reassess prior conclusions related to expired or existing contracts that are or that contain leases, and not reassess the accounting for initial direct costs. Operating leases with a term of 12 months or less will not be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additional information and disclosures required by ASU No. 2016-02 are contained in Note 13 Leases.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses”. The standard, including subsequently issued amendments (ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2019-11), requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable and certain other financial assets, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 to postpone the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for public business entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
