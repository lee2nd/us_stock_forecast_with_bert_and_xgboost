ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
PacWest Bancorp, a Delaware corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the BHCA, with our corporate headquarters located in Beverly Hills, California. Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank. References to “Pacific Western” or the “Bank” refer to Pacific Western Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. References to “we,” “us,” or the “Company” refer to PacWest Bancorp together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. When we refer to “PacWest” or to the “holding company,” we are referring to PacWest Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis.
The Bank is focused on relationship-based business banking to small, middle-market, and venture-backed businesses nationwide. The Bank offers a broad range of loan and lease and deposit products and services through 70 full-service branches located in California, one branch located in Durham, North Carolina, one branch located in Denver, Colorado, and numerous loan production offices across the country. The Bank provides community banking products including lending and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and medium-sized businesses conducted primarily through our California-based branch offices and Denver, Colorado branch office. The Bank offers national lending products including asset-based, equipment, and real estate loans and treasury management services to established middle-market businesses on a national basis. The Bank also offers venture banking products including a comprehensive suite of financial services focused on entrepreneurial and venture-backed businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors, with offices located in key innovation hubs across the United States. In addition, we provide investment advisory and asset management services to select clients through Pacific Western Asset Management Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and an SEC-registered investment adviser.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had total assets of $29.5 billion, including $19.1 billion of total loans and leases, net of deferred fees, and $5.2 billion of securities available-for-sale, compared to $26.8 billion of total assets, including $18.8 billion of total loans and leases, net of deferred fees, and $3.8 billion of securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2019. The $2.7 billion increase in total assets since year-end was due primarily to a $2.5 billion increase in interest-earning deposits in financial institutions and a $1.4 billion increase in securities available-for-sale, offset partially by a $1.47 billion write-down of goodwill.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had total liabilities of $25.9 billion, including total deposits of $24.9 billion and borrowings of $5.0 million, compared to $21.8 billion of total liabilities, including $19.2 billion of total deposits and $1.8 billion of borrowings at December 31, 2019. The $4.1 billion increase in total liabilities since year-end was due mainly to increases of $6.1 billion in core deposits and $653.1 million in non-core non-maturity deposits, offset partially by decreases of $1.8 billion in borrowings, primarily FHLB advances, and $1.0 billion in time deposits. The increase in core deposits was due primarily to capital market activities by our venture banking clients, which saw deposits increase by $3.9 billion to $11.0 billion at December 31, 2020, and to PPP loan proceeds being deposited into customers' accounts. At December 31, 2020, core deposits totaled $22.3 billion, or 89% of total deposits, including $9.2 billion of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, or 37% of total deposits.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had total stockholders' equity of $3.6 billion compared to $5.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The $1.36 billion decrease in stockholders' equity since year-end was due mainly to a $1.24 billion net loss, attributable primarily to a $1.47 billion goodwill impairment charge, $159.7 million of cash dividends paid, and $70.0 million of common stock repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program, offset partially by a $93.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. Consolidated capital ratios remained strong and continued to increase with Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios of 10.53% and 13.76% at December 31, 2020, up 75 basis points and 135 basis points compared to December 31, 2019.
Recent Events
Acquisition of Civic Ventures, LLC
On February 1, 2021, the Bank acquired Civic Ventures, LLC and subsidiaries (“Civic”) in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition is not considered significant under SEC regulations. Civic Financial Services is the primary operating entity of Civic. Civic is one of the leading institutional private lenders in the United States specializing in residential non-owner-occupied investment properties. Civic will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. The acquisition of Civic advances the Bank’s strategy to expand its lending portfolio and diversify its revenue streams.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease ("COVID-19") pandemic has impacted our business and operations in several ways as outlined below. Our first and continuing priority remains the safety and health of our employees and customers as we navigate our way through the pandemic. In the first quarter of 2020, we activated our Business Continuity Team and Pandemic Plan under the direction of a special task force comprised of executive level management from various departments to work closely with the Business Continuity Team to help lead our people and our business through this period of uncertainty. The special task force has continued to meet at least weekly since the onset of the pandemic.
Our Employees
We took several actions in March 2020 to move everyone possible to a remote working environment, which has continued to this day; however, as an essential business service, some of our employees are required to work at one of our critical offices or at one of our branch locations where we are practicing social distancing and other safety measures. We have applied social distancing, wearing of face masks, remote working, additional cleaning, reminders of frequent handwashing, installation of plexiglass barriers among other steps to ensure the health and safety of employees and customers. We suspended all employee business travel and canceled all hosted client events. We require anyone who has traveled personally to a foreign country or on a cruise, to self-quarantine for 14 days. Despite these restrictions, we have remained fully operational and able to meet the needs of our clients and the communities we serve. To recognize our employees who must work in our branches or critical locations, we paid a special bonus of up to $1,000 in the second quarter of 2020. We have begun to re-open some office locations if permitted under local government guidance, but any such re-openings generally remain limited to no more than a 50% capacity. Despite some re-openings, the vast majority of our non-branch employees continue to work remotely.
Our Clients and Branch Operations
Our primary branch operations are within California, which continues to work its way through the State's Resilience Roadmap from the initial "Stay-at-home" order issued on March 13, 2020 to the subsequent executive orders and phased-in guidance issued for re-openings. As a large state, the stages of re-opening vary by county and thus the impact to our operations varies by county. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed 19 branches along with the lobbies of 27 additional branches where drive-up tellers are available. In June 2020, we re-opened 17 of the 19 branches and decided to permanently close two branches in the third quarter and two more branches in the fourth quarter. In February 2021, we re-opened the 27 lobbies and are now operating all branches normally. We continue to monitor the pandemic's impact on our branch operations and have alternative plans in place in the event we need to reduce branch hours, temporarily close branches in close proximity to each other, or stagger the hours of our employees, all in an effort to keep our employees and customers safe while meeting the needs of our customers.
Impact to Our Business
From a business perspective, the impacts in 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic have been primarily related to our loan portfolio. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an increase in customers seeking loan modifications through payment deferrals and extension of terms. As of December 31, 2020, active loan payment deferral modifications represented approximately 0.8% of the loan portfolio, down from approximately 6.6% of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2020. Most of the modifications were for payment deferrals for three months, while some deferrals were up to six months. The remaining $155 million of loans on deferral as of December 31, 2020 expire by June 30, 2021.We also granted maturity extensions totaling approximately $376 million primarily for three months, while some extensions were for one year. The Company did not apply a TDR classification to COVID-19 related loan modifications that met all of the requisite criteria as stipulated in the CARES Act.
We actively participated in the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act by funding approximately 4,100 loans, most with two year terms, for $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2020, PPP loans had an outstanding balance of approximately $1.1 billion. The loans have two or three year terms with a 1% loan coupon rate and origination fees that varied from 1% to 5% depending on the size of the loan. These fees, which originally totaled approximately $36.4 million, are recognized over the life of the loan with the fee recognition accelerated upon forgiveness or repayment of the loan. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized fees, net of deferred costs, totaled $19.4 million. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and do not carry an allowance. Our participation in the PPP resulted in a corresponding increase in core deposits in the second quarter of 2020 due to PPP loan proceeds being deposited into customers' accounts. We intend to participate in the second round of the PPP program in 2021, but expect the dollar amount of loans funded to be less than the original program.
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in March 2020, we immediately enhanced the monitoring of our loan and lease portfolio with particular emphasis on certain loan and lease portfolios that we expected to be most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the hotel, retail, commercial aviation, restaurant, and oil services loan and lease portfolios. The hotel portfolio as of December 31, 2020 is comprised of hotel CRE loans of $571.9 million, hotel construction loans of $549.0 million, and hotel SBA loans of $29.6 million. The economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated loan and lease risk rating downgrades across these loan and lease portfolios, resulting in increases of $398.3 million in special mention loans and $89.4 million in classified loans during the year ended December 31, 2020, most of which occurred in the first quarter.
The table below shows our exposure to these loan and lease portfolios, which includes equipment leased to others under operating leases, as of the date indicated:
The deterioration in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the economic forecasts and assumptions used in our estimation process for the allowance for credit losses under CECL. Although our provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased by $87.0 million from the third quarter of 2020 to $10.0 million, the provision for credit losses increased by $317.0 million to $339.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. Deterioration in the macro-economic variables used in economic forecasts we utilize in our allowance for credit losses estimation has contributed to a higher provision for credit losses for the year. For further details on CECL and the impacts to our process in the year, see “- Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment” contained herein. .
During the first quarter of 2020, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in market volatility and a significant decline in stock market valuations, including our stock price. As a result, we performed a goodwill impairment assessment and recorded goodwill impairment of $1.47 billion in the first quarter, as the estimated fair value of equity was less than book value as of March 31, 2020. This is a non-cash charge and had no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, cash flows, or liquidity position. The goodwill impairment charge resulted in a net loss of $1.43 billion in the first quarter and although our net earnings excluding the goodwill impairment charge were $36.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, the results contributed to our decision to reduce our quarterly dividend from $0.60 per share to $0.25 per share beginning in the second quarter.
On March 23, 2020, we announced the temporary suspension of share repurchases under our stock repurchase program until June 30, 2020 and, subsequently announced on April 21, 2020, the indefinite suspension of any repurchases in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have not repurchased any shares since February 28, 2020.
Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging as the duration of the pandemic remains uncertain. The timing and extent of vaccination programs will play an integral role in easing or lifting various restrictions thereby influencing the economic recovery. The economic forecasts will continue to impact our calculations for determining the allowance for credit losses and related provision for credit losses.
Key Performance Indicators
Among other factors, our operating results generally depend on the following key performance indicators:
The Level of Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the excess of interest earned on our interest-earning assets over the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is net interest income (annualized if related to a quarterly period) expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Tax equivalent net interest income is net interest income increased by an adjustment for tax-exempt interest on certain loans and investment securities based on a 21% federal statutory tax rate. Tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated as tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary interest-earning assets are loans and investment securities, and our primary interest-bearing liabilities are deposits and borrowings. Contributing to our high net interest margin is our high yield on loans and leases and competitive cost of deposits. While our deposit balances will fluctuate depending on deposit holders’ perceptions of alternative yields available in the market, we seek to minimize the impact of these variances by attracting a high percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits.
Loan and Lease Growth
We actively seek new lending opportunities under an array of lending products. Our lending activities include real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, commercial loans and leases, and a small amount of consumer lending. Our commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans are secured by a range of property types. Our commercial loans and leases portfolio is diverse and generally includes various asset-secured loans, equipment-secured loans and leases, venture capital loans to support venture capital firms’ operations and the operations of entrepreneurial and venture-backed companies during the various phases of their early life cycles, and secured business loans.
Our loan origination process emphasizes credit quality. To augment our internal loan production, we have historically purchased multi-family loans from other banks, private student loans from third-party lenders, and single-family renovation construction loans from Civic. These loan purchases help us manage the concentrations in our portfolio as they diversify the geographic, interest-rate risk, credit risk, and product composition of our loan portfolio. Achieving net loan growth is subject to many factors, including maintaining strict credit standards, competition from other lenders, and borrowers that opt to prepay loans.
The Magnitude of Credit Losses
We emphasize credit quality in originating and monitoring our loans and leases, and we measure our success by the levels of our classified loans and leases, nonaccrual loans and leases, and net charge-offs. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, which is the sum of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Provisions for credit losses are charged to operations as and when needed for both on and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Loans and leases that are deemed uncollectable are charged off and deducted from the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off are added to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The provision for credit losses on the loan and lease portfolio is based on our allowance methodology, which considers the impact of assumptions and is reflective of historical experience, economic forecasts viewed to be reasonable and supportable by management, the current loan and lease composition, and relative credit risks known as of the balance sheet date. For originated and acquired credit-deteriorated loans, a provision for credit losses may be recorded to reflect credit deterioration after the origination date or after the acquisition date, respectively.
We regularly review loans and leases to determine whether there has been any deterioration in credit quality resulting from borrower operations or changes in collateral value or other factors which may affect collectability of our loans and leases. Changes in economic conditions, such as the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, rate of inflation, increases in the general level of interest rates, declines in real estate values, changes in commodity prices, and adverse conditions in borrowers’ businesses, could negatively impact our borrowers and cause us to adversely classify loans and leases. An increase in classified loans and leases generally results in increased provisions for credit losses and an increased allowance for credit losses. Any deterioration in the commercial real estate market may lead to increased provisions for credit losses because our loans are concentrated in commercial real estate loans.
The Level of Noninterest Expense
Our noninterest expense includes fixed and controllable overhead, the largest components of which are compensation and occupancy expense. It also includes costs that tend to vary based on the volume of activity, such as loan and lease production and the number and complexity of foreclosed assets. We measure success in controlling both fixed and variable costs through monitoring of the efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense (less intangible asset amortization, net foreclosed assets expense (income), goodwill impairment, and acquisition, integration and reorganization costs) by net revenues (the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, less gain (loss) on sale of securities and gain (loss) on sales of assets other than loans and leases).
The following table presents the calculation of our efficiency ratio for the years indicated:
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results may ultimately differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and on our results of operations for the reporting periods.
Our significant accounting policies and practices are described in Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." We have identified three policies and estimates as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies relate to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the realization of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment
For information regarding the calculation and policies of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment using the CECL methodology effective January 1, 2020, see " - Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment" and "Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (a) Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020" and "(i) Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Goodwill and other intangible assets generated from business combinations and deemed to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization and instead are tested for impairment annually unless a triggering event occurs thereby requiring an updated assessment. Our regular annual impairment assessment occurs in the fourth quarter. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. Impairment exists when the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess as a charge to "Noninterest expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Our deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We determine whether a deferred tax asset is realizable based on facts and circumstances, including our current and projected future tax position, the historical level of our taxable income, and estimates of our future taxable income. In most cases, the realization of deferred tax assets is based on our future profitability. If we were to experience either reduced profitability or operating losses in a future period, the realization of our deferred tax assets may no longer be considered more likely than not and, accordingly, we could be required to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by charging earnings.
Non-GAAP Measurements
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of such financial performance. The methodology for determining these non-GAAP measures may differ among companies. We use the following non-GAAP measures in this Form 10-K:
•Return on average tangible equity, tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per share: Given that the use of these measures is prevalent among banking regulators, investors and analysts, we disclose them in addition to the related GAAP measures of return on average equity, equity to assets ratio, and book value per share, respectively. In 2020, we changed the calculation of return on average tangible equity to add back intangible asset amortization to net earnings to arrive at adjusted net earnings. Prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the GAAP measurements are presented in the following tables for and as of the periods presented.
____________________________________________________
(1) Net earnings (loss) divided by average stockholders' equity.
(2) Adjusted net earnings divided by average tangible common equity.
_________________________________________________________________
(1) Tangible common equity divided by tangible assets.
(2) Tangible common equity divided by shares outstanding.
•Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share: These non-GAAP measurements are presented in the following tables for the periods presented. See Note 16. Earnings (Loss) Per Share for the GAAP calculation of earnings per share.
Results of Operations
Earnings Performance
2020 Compared to 2019
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.24 billion, or $10.61 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $468.6 million, or $3.90 per diluted share. The $1.71 billion decrease in net earnings was due primarily to a $1.47 billion goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2020, a higher provision for credit losses of $317.0 million, and higher operating expense of $11.8 million, offset partially by higher noninterest income of $3.5 million and lower income tax expense of $89.1 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses for 2020 was the result of the impact of the current economic forecast used in our ACL estimation, which reflected a significant deterioration in key macro-economic forecast variables such as unemployment and GDP growth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in operating expense was due mainly to increases of $9.1 million in other expense, $6.2 million in insurance and assessments, $4.8 million in leased equipment depreciation, $3.7 million in customer related expense, and $3.5 million in foreclosed assets expense, offset partially by decreases of $14.4 million in compensation expense and $4.0 million in intangible asset amortization. The increase in noninterest income for 2020 was due primarily to a $15.6 million increase in dividends and gain on equity investments, offset partially by a $12.3 million decrease in gain on sale of securities.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $468.6 million, or $3.90 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $465.3 million, or $3.72 per diluted share. The $3.3 million increase in net earnings was due to a lower provision for credit losses of $23.0 million, lower noninterest expense of $9.0 million, and lower income tax expense of $3.7 million, offset partially by lower net interest income of $26.3 million and lower noninterest income of $6.1 million.
The provision for credit losses decreased due mainly to lower specific provisions for impaired loans during 2019 and lower provisions related to the reserve for unfunded loan commitments during 2019 due to updates on utilization factors which estimate the percentage of available credit that will be utilized by our borrowers.
Noninterest expense declined due principally to lower other expense of $8.8 million. Other expense decreased due mostly to $2.1 million of lower amortization of non-competition agreements, $2.0 million in lower franchise tax expense, a $1.7 million reversal of previously accrued merger costs, $1.3 million in lower employee related expenses, and $1.1 million in lower operating and other losses.
Net interest income decreased due to interest expense growth of $84.5 million exceeding interest income growth of $58.2 million. Interest expense increased due to the cost of deposits increasing to 0.77% in 2019 compared to 0.44% in 2018 due mainly to higher rates paid on deposits in conjunction with increased market rates. Interest income increased due primarily to a higher average balance of loans and leases, partially offset by a lower yield on loans and leases due to lower discount accretion and from de-risking initiatives which have resulted in lower yields on newly originated loans compared to the yields on loans that have matured and paid off.
Noninterest income declined due mostly to lower other income of $13.7 million, lower dividends and gains on equity investments of $4.4 million, a lower gain on sale of loans of $3.6 million, and lower other commissions and fees of $1.9 million, offset partially by a higher gain on sale of securities of $17.3 million. Other income declined due primarily to lower gains on early lease terminations, lower legal settlements with former borrowers, and lower BOLI income. Dividends and gains on equity investments declined due primarily to lower gains on the sale of equity investments and lower dividends received in 2019 as compared to 2018 as a significant portion of our equity investments were sold in the second quarter of 2018. Gain on sale of loans declined due to a net gain of $1.1 million on sales of $101.5 million of loans in 2019 compared to a net gain of $4.7 million on sales of $641.9 million of loans during 2018. Other commissions and fees decreased due primarily to lower loan prepayment penalty fees offset partially by higher foreign exchange fees, unused commitment fees and customer success fees. Gain on sale of securities increased due mainly to a net gain of $25.4 million on sales of $1.6 billion of securities in 2019 compared to a net gain of $8.2 million on sales of $563.6 million in 2018.
Net Interest Income
The following table summarizes the distribution of average assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity, as well as interest income and yields earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, presented on a tax equivalent basis, for the years indicated:
_____________________
(1) Includes nonaccrual loans and leases and loan fees. Includes tax-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt interest on loans.
(2) Tax equivalent.
(3) Includes discount accretion on acquired loans of $13.1 million, $12.1 million, and $29.3 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
(4) Includes tax-equivalent adjustments of $6.1 million, $6.2 million, and $7.0 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, related to tax-exempt interest on investment securities. The federal statutory rate utilized was 21%.
(5) Total deposits is the sum of interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The cost of total deposits is calculated as annualized interest expense on total deposits divided by average total deposits.
Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amounts of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The changes in the yields earned on average interest-earning assets and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities are referred to as changes in “rate.” The changes in the amounts of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are referred to as changes in “volume.” The change in interest income/expense attributable to rate reflects the change in rate multiplied by the prior year’s volume. The change in interest income/expense attributable to volume reflects the change in volume multiplied by the prior year’s rate. The change in interest income/expense not attributable specifically to either rate or volume is allocated ratably between the two categories.
The following table presents changes in interest income (tax equivalent) and interest expense and related changes in rate and volume for the years indicated:
_____________________
(1) Tax equivalent.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net interest income held steady at $1.01 billion for both the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 due mainly to a lower yield on average loans and leases, offset partially by a lower cost of average interest-bearing deposits and a higher balance of average loans and leases. The tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 6.00% for 2019. The decrease in the yield on average loans and leases was due mainly to lower loan coupon interest from the repricing of variable-rate loans in conjunction with decreased market rates and a lower rate on loan production from the impact of the PPP loans. Excluding the PPP loans, which have a coupon rate of 1%, the tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was 5.27% in 2020.
The tax equivalent NIM for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.05% compared to 4.54% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the tax equivalent NIM was due mostly to the decrease in the yield on average loans and leases as described above, offset partially by the lower cost of average interest-bearing deposits. Excluding the PPP loans, the tax equivalent NIM was 4.08% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The cost of average total deposits decreased to 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 0.77% for 2019 due mainly to lower rates paid on deposits resulting from decreased market rates.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net interest income decreased by $26.3 million to $1.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.04 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to interest expense growth exceeding interest income growth. Interest expense increased by $84.5 million due mainly to a higher cost and balance of average interest-bearing deposits, a lower balance of average noninterest-bearing deposits, and a higher balance and cost of average borrowings. Interest income increased by $58.2 million due primarily to a higher balance of average loans and leases, offset partially by a lower rate on average loans and leases. The tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was 6.00% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 6.22% for 2018. The decrease in the yield on average loans and leases was due in part to lower discount accretion on acquired loans (seven basis points for 2019 compared to 17 basis points for 2018). The decrease in the average loan and lease yield was also influenced by the credit de-risking initiatives taken over the last couple of years which has seen the replacement of higher yielding loans, such as cash flow, with lower yielding multi-family and equity fund loans. These factors were partially offset by upward repricing of variable-rate loans attributable to four quarter-point increases in the fed funds target rate during 2018 and in effect through the first half of 2019, only recently mitigated by three quarter-point cuts to the fed funds target rate during the second half of 2019.
The tax equivalent NIM for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 4.54% compared to 5.05% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in the tax equivalent NIM was due mostly to higher deposit and borrowing costs, as well as the decrease in the yield on average loans and leases as described above. Total discount accretion on acquired loans contributed six basis points to the NIM for year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 14 basis points for 2018.
The cost of average total deposits increased to 0.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 0.44% for 2018 due mainly to higher rates paid on deposits in conjunction with increased market rates, along with a shift in our deposit mix resulting from increases in average interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits.
Provision for Credit Losses
The following table sets forth the details of the provision for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment and information regarding credit quality metrics for the years indicated:
______________________
(1) See "- Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment" for detail of charge-offs and recoveries by loan portfolio segment, class, and subclass for the periods presented.
Provisions for credit losses are charged to earnings for both on and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The provision for credit losses on our loans and leases held for investment is based on our allowance methodology and is an expense that, in our judgment, is required to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses.
The provision for credit losses increased by $317.0 million to $339.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of the impact of the current economic forecast used in our ACL estimation, which reflected a significant deterioration in key macro-economic forecast variables such as unemployment and GDP growth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The provision for credit losses declined by $23.0 million to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due mainly to lower specific provisions for impaired loans during 2019 and lower provisions related to the reserve for unfunded loan commitments during 2019 due to updates on utilization factors which estimate the percentage of available credit that will be utilized by our borrowers.
Certain circumstances may lead to increased provisions for credit losses in the future. Examples of such circumstances are an increased amount of classified and/or nonperforming loans and leases, net loan and lease and unfunded commitment growth, and changes in economic conditions and forecasts. Changes in economic conditions and forecasts include the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, the rate of inflation, changes in the general level of interest rates, changes in real estate values, and adverse conditions in borrowers’ businesses. For information regarding the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment, see "- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment," "- Balance Sheet Analysis - Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases Held for Investment," Note 1(i).

Noninterest Income
The following table summarizes noninterest income by category for the years indicated:
2020 Compared to 2019
Noninterest income increased by $3.5 million to $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due mainly to increases of $15.6 million in dividends and gains on equity investments and $4.9 million in leased equipment income, offset partially by decreases of $12.3 million in gain on sale of securities, $4.3 million in service charges on deposit accounts, and $3.3 million in other commissions and fees. Dividends and gains on equity investments increased due primarily to increases in the fair value of equity investments still held and higher gains on sale of equity investments sold. Leased equipment income increased due to early lease terminations resulting in higher termination gains in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and a higher average balance of leases in 2020 resulting in higher lease income as compared to 2019, offset partially by lower rental income attributable to two operating leases placed on nonaccrual status in 2020. The decrease in gain on sale of securities resulted from the sale of $160.3 million of securities for a gain of $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to sales of $1.6 billion of securities for a gain of $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased due primarily to lower analysis fees and NSF fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to last year as we waived certain fees for a period of time as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other commissions and fees decreased primarily due to lower credit card fee income and lower foreign exchange fees, offset partially by higher customer success fees.
2019 Compared to 2018
Noninterest income declined by $6.1 million to $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $148.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due mostly to decreases of $13.7 million in other income, $4.4 million in dividends and gains on equity investments, $3.6 million in gain on sale of loans and leases, and $1.9 million in other commissions and fees, offset partially by an increase in gain on sale of securities of $17.3 million. Other income declined due primarily to lower gains on early lease terminations, lower legal settlements with former borrowers, and lower BOLI income. Dividends and gains on equity investments decreased due primarily to lower gains on the sale of equity investments and lower dividends received in 2019 as compared to 2018 as a significant portion of our equity investments were sold in the second quarter of 2018. Gain on sale of loans and leases declined due to a net gain of $1.1 million on sales of $101.5 million of loans and leases during 2019 compared to a net gain of $4.7 million on sales of $641.9 million of loans and leases during 2018. The loans and leases sold during 2018 included the sale of a large nonaccrual loan for a $2.4 million gain and the settlement of our December 31, 2017 loans held for sale of $481.1 million for a $1.3 million gain. Other commissions and fees decreased due primarily to lower loan prepayment penalty fees of $4.2 million, offset partially by higher foreign exchange fees of $0.8 million, higher unused commitment fees of $0.8 million, and higher customer success fees of $0.5 million. Gain on sale of securities increased due mainly to a net gain of $25.4 million on sales of $1.6 billion of securities during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net gain of $8.2 million on sales of $563.6 million of securities during 2018. The higher gain on sale of securities in 2019 is due primarily to the repositioning of a portion of our securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2019 to shorten the duration of the portfolio, to enhance liquidity, and to take advantage of municipal security price appreciation due to market dynamics from tax law changes. The securities sold in 2018 included $299.9 million that were sold for a gain of $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily for reinvestment in higher quality liquid assets, yield, and credit risk purposes.
Noninterest Expense
The following table summarizes noninterest expense by category for the years indicated:
2020 Compared to 2019
Noninterest expense increased by $1.48 billion to $1.98 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $502.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due mainly to a $1.47 billion goodwill impairment charge incurred in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased by $11.8 million to $514.0 million in 2020. This increase was due mainly to increases of $9.1 million in other expense, $6.2 million in insurance and assessments, $4.8 million in leased equipment depreciation, $3.7 million in customer related expense, and $3.5 million in foreclosed assets expense, offset partially by decreases of $14.4 million in compensation expense and $4.0 million in intangible asset amortization. Other expense increased due mainly to $6.6 million in prepayment penalties incurred in the second quarter of 2020 from the early payoff of $750 million of FHLB term advances and higher litigation accruals, offset partially by lower business development expenses and employee related expenses as a result of COVID-19. Insurance and assessments expense increased due primarily to an increase in our FDIC assessment rate as a result of the first quarter 2020 loss from the goodwill impairment charge. Leased equipment depreciation increased due principally to a higher average balance of leased equipment. Customer related expenses increased due mostly to higher customer analysis expenses and reciprocal deposit referral fees. Foreclosed assets expense increased due principally to lower gains on the sale of foreclosed assets. Compensation expense decreased due mainly to lower bonus expense in the 2020 period compared to the prior year based on Company financial performance in 2020. Intangible asset amortization decreased due mostly to lower CDI amortization related to financial institutions acquired in 2015 and 2017.
2019 Compared to 2018
Noninterest expense decreased by $9.0 million to $502.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $511.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to a decline in other expense of $8.8 million. Other expense decreased due mostly to $2.1 million of lower amortization of non-competition agreements, $2.0 million in lower franchise tax expense, a $1.7 million reversal of previously accrued merger costs, $1.3 million in lower employee related expenses, and $1.1 million in lower operating and other losses. There were also noteworthy year-over-year fluctuations in compensation expense, occupancy expense, other professional services expense, insurance and assessments expense, customer related expense, and foreclosed assets (income) expense, net. Compensation expense increased due primarily to higher bonus expense attributable to achievement of performance metrics in excess of targets. Occupancy expense increased due mainly to an increased number of office locations. Other professional services expense decreased mostly as a result of lower legal and consulting expense. Insurance and assessments expense decreased primarily due to the 4.5 basis point FDIC surcharge ending in the third quarter of 2018. Customer related expense increased due to an increase in the number of deposit customers on analysis and a higher utilization of analysis credits by customers to pay third-party expenses. Foreclosed assets (income) expense, net, increased mainly due to higher gains on the sale of foreclosed assets
Income Taxes
The effective tax rates were (6.5)%, 26.0% and 26.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Excluding non-deductible goodwill impairment, the effective income tax rate was 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2020 effective tax rate of 24.4%, adjusted for non-deductible goodwill impairment, was lower than the 2019 effective tax rate of 26.0% attributable primarily to tax benefits from amended state tax returns of prior tax years due to changes in state apportionment rates. The Company's 2020 blended statutory tax rate for federal and state was 27.7%. For further information on income taxes, see Note 15. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Fourth Quarter Results
The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results and certain performance metrics for the periods indicated:
____________________
(1) Calculation reduces average equity by average intangible assets.
(2) Non-GAAP measurement.
Fourth Quarter of 2020 Compared to Third Quarter of 2020
Net earnings were $116.8 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $45.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2020. The quarter-over-quarter increase in net earnings of $71.3 million was due to a lower provision for credit losses of $87.0 million, higher net interest income of $7.9 million, and higher noninterest income of $1.6 million, offset partially by higher noninterest expense of $2.3 million, and higher income tax expense of $22.9 million.
The provision for credit losses declined due to improvement in certain key macro-economic forecast variables, a lower provision for unfunded loan commitments, and decreased provisions for individually evaluated loans and leases.
Net interest income increased by $7.9 million to $259.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $251.3 million for the third quarter of 2020 due mainly to higher income on investment securities, higher loan prepayment fees, higher recapture of nonaccrual interest, higher amortized loan fee income from PPP loan forgiveness, and lower interest expense, offset partially by a negative impact on net interest income due the change in earning assets mix and a lower average balance of average loans and leases. The tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was 5.15% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 5.01% for the third quarter of 2020. The increase in the tax equivalent yield on average loans and leases was due primarily to higher loan prepayment fees, higher recapture of nonaccrual interest, and higher amortized loan fee income from PPP loan forgiveness in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.
The tax equivalent NIM was 3.83% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 3.90% for the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in the NIM was due mostly to the change in the earning assets mix. Average loans and leases decreased by $426.5 million, while the average balance of deposits in financial institutions increased by $1.0 billion and the average balance of investment securities increased by $781.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The cost of average total deposits decreased to 0.14% for the fourth quarter of 2020 from 0.17% for the third quarter of 2020 due mainly to the repricing of maturing brokered time deposits.
Noninterest income increased by $1.6 million to $39.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $38.3 million for the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to an increase of $6.8 million in warrant income attributable to higher gains from exercised warrants, and an increase of $1.6 million in gain on sale of loans and leases, offset partially by decreases of $5.3 million in gain on sale of securities and $1.9 million in dividends and gains on equity investments. The increase in the gain on sale of loans and leases resulted from the sales of $119.9 million of loans for a gain of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to sales of $3.0 million for a gain of $35,000 in the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in the gain on sale of securities resulted from minimal sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to sales of $17.0 million of securities for a gain of $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in dividends and gains on equity investments was due primarily to lower net fair value gains on equity investments still held, offset partially by higher income from distributions on equity investments.
Noninterest expense increased by $2.3 million to $135.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $133.4 million for the third quarter of 2020 attributable primarily to increases of $2.1 million in other professional services, $1.1 million in insurance and assessments, $1.1 million in acquisition, integration and reorganization costs, and $1.1 million in other expense, offset partially by a decrease of $2.0 million in compensation expense. The increase in other professional services was due mainly to higher consulting expense. The increase in insurance and assessments expense was due to an increase in FDIC assessment expense. The increase in acquisition, integration and reorganization costs was due to advisory services. The increase in other expense was due primarily to an increase in franchise taxes. The decrease in compensation expense was due mainly to lower bonus accruals and lower stock compensation expense.

Loans and Leases Held for Investment
The following table presents the composition of our total loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, by loan portfolio segment, class, and subclass as of the dates indicated:
________________________________
(1) Includes $167.1 million, $173.4 million, $168.9 million, $180.1 million, and $152.9 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 of land acquisition and development loans.
Our loan portfolio segments of real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, and commercial loans comprised 41%, 18%, and 39% of our total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020, compared to 42%, 15%, and 41% at December 31, 2019, respectively.
The changes during 2020 in the portfolio classes comprising these portfolio segments reflected the following:
•Commercial real estate mortgage loans decreased by 3% to $4.1 billion or 21% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020 from $4.2 billion or 22% at December 31, 2019. The lower balance and composition ratio was attributable primarily to the balance of healthcare real estate loans declining by 47% to $177.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $334.1 million at December 31, 2019. In October 2019, we stopped actively originating healthcare real estate loans.
•Income producing and other residential real estate mortgage loans increased slightly by 1% to $3.80 billion or 20% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020 from $3.77 billion or 20% at December 31, 2019.
•Commercial real estate construction and land loans increased by 3% to $1.12 billion or 6% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020 from $1.08 billion or 6% at December 31, 2019. The net increase in the balance was attributable to increases in balances on existing and new loans as disbursements occur during construction that are offset by repayments of loans stemming from our loans being refinanced or the properties securing our loans being sold.
•Residential real estate construction and land loans increased by 36% to $2.2 billion or 12% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020 from $1.7 billion or 9% at December 31, 2019. The higher balance and composition ratio was attributable to increases in balances on existing and new loans as disbursements occur during construction which are offset by repayments of loans stemming from our loans being refinanced or the properties securing our loans being sold.
•Asset-based loans and leases decreased by 9% to $3.4 billion or 18% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020 from $3.7 billion or 20% at December 31, 2019. The lower balance and composition ratio was due primarily to payments and payoffs exceeding newly originated loans and leases in equipment finance and other asset based loans. Equipment finance loans and leases decreased to $700.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $852.3 million at December 31, 2019, and other asset-based loans decreased to $194.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $309.9 million at December 31, 2019.
•Venture capital loans decreased by 22% to $1.7 billion or 9% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020 from $2.2 billion or 12% at December 31, 2019. The lower balance and composition ratio was attributable to lower equity fund loans and venture lending loans to venture-backed companies. Equity fund loans decreased to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Venture lending loans decreased to $665.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $980.2 million at December 31, 2019.
•Other commercial loans increased by 34% to $2.4 billion or 12% of total loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2020 from $1.8 billion or 9% at December 31, 2019. The higher balance and composition ratio was attributable primarily to Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loans originated in 2020, offset partially by lower security monitoring loans, which decreased by 47% to $329.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $619.3 million at December 31, 2019, and to the declining balance of secured business loans, which decreased to $430.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $583.3 million at December 31, 2019. In October 2019, we stopped originating security monitoring loans.
The following table presents the geographic composition of our real estate loans held for investment, net of deferred fees, by the top ten states and all other states combined (in the order presented for the current year-end) as of the dates indicated:
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, 62% and 61% of our real estate loans were collateralized by property located in California because our full-service branches and our community banking activities are primarily located in California. The increase in real estate loans in Colorado reflects the growth from opening our Denver branch in November 2019.
The following table presents a roll forward of loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, for the years indicated:
_______________________________________
(1) Includes direct financing leases but excludes equipment leased to others under operating leases.
(2) The weighted average rate on production presents contractual rates on a tax equivalent basis and does not include amortized fees. Amortized fees added approximately 25 basis points to loan yields in 2020, 22 basis points to loan yields in 2019, and 31 basis points to loan yields in 2018.
(3) The weighted average rate on production for 2020 was 4.66% excluding PPP loans.
Loan and Lease Interest Rate Sensitivity
The following table presents contractual maturity information for loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, as of the date indicated:
At December 31, 2020, we had $5.3 billion of loans and leases held for investment due to mature over the next twelve months. For any of these loans and leases held for investment, in the event that we provide a concession through a refinance or modification that we would not ordinarily consider in order to protect as much of our investment as possible, such loans may be considered TDRs even though the loans have performed in accordance with their contractual terms. The circumstances regarding any modifications and a borrower's specific situation, such as its ability to obtain financing from another source at similar market terms, are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if a contractual loan renewal or loan extension constitutes a TDR. Higher levels of TDRs may result in increases in classified loans and credit loss provisions.
The following table presents the interest rate profile of loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, due after one year as of the date indicated:
