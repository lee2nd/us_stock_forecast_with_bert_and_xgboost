Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Effects of COVID-19
As of the date of this Annual Report, there remain significant uncertainties regarding the current novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, including the scope of health issues, the possible duration of the pandemic and the extent of local and worldwide social, political and economic disruption it may cause in the future.
To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a discernable short-term negative impact on the ability of our company to obtain capital needed to accelerate the development of our business.
With respect to our business operations, while our product sales have increased moderately since the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due primarily to our recently introducing hand sanitizer gel and spray products, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has had a discernable short-term negative impact on our product sales, inasmuch as we and our distributors have been limited in face-to-face sales meetings with respect to our products. We are unable to predict when such limitations will ease.
Overall, our company is not of a size that has required us to implement “company-wide” policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our product manufacturing operations have experienced no negative consequences attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, inasmuch as these operations involve a limited number of persons. However, as the states continue to re-open, re-close, then re-open their economies, the scope and nature of the impacts of COVID-19 on our company will evolve day-by-day, week-by-week.
The COVID-19 pandemic can be expect to continue to result in regional and local quarantines, labor stoppages and shortages, changes in consumer purchasing patterns, mandatory or elective shut-downs of retail locations, disruptions to supply chains, including the inability of our suppliers to deliver materials on a timely basis, or at all, severe market volatility, liquidity disruptions and overall economic instability. It can be further expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have unpredictably adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware.
We intend to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only on our company, but on the operations of our customers, consumers and supply chains, and intend to make adjustments accordingly. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact continues to impact the United States and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world, all of which remains highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
In light of these uncertainties, for purposes of the discussion below, except where otherwise indicated, the descriptions of our business, our strategies, our risk factors and any other forward-looking statements, including regarding us, our business and the market generally, do not reflect the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or our responses thereto.
Basis of Presentation
Our company was a “shell company” from 2014 through all of 2019. Effective January 1, 2020, we acquired Black Bird Potentials Inc. (“Black Bird”), in a transaction accounted for as a “reverse merger”.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes financial results of (1) our company, Digital Development Partners, Inc., for the year ended December 31, 2020, including those of Black Bird, and December 31, 2019, and (2) the historical financial results of Black Bird for the year ended December 31, 2019.
In addition, this section presents information concerning Black Bird for the periods and as of the dates indicated. This information includes Black Bird’s financial results, as well as narrative descriptions thereof. In addition, where appropriate, this section presents pro forma financial information, which assumes our company’s acquisition of Black Bird had occurred on certain prior dates, as indicated.
Cautionary Statement
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes, beginning on page of this Annual Report.
Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the following discussion, as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements included herein.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
•
Only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure.
•
Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
•
Not having to obtain non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
•
Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates, or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens herein, and the information that we provide may be different than what you might get from other public companies in which you hold stock.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements beginning on page. We consider our critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition, inventory and fair value of financial instruments.
Our management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
Overview and Outlook
With the acquisition of Black Bird effective January 1, 2020, Black Bird’s operations became the operations of our company.
Black Bird is the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and distributor of MiteXstream, an EPA-registered plant-based biopesticide effective in the eradication of spider mites, a pest that destroys crops, especially cannabis, hops, coffee, and house plants, as well as molds and mildew. Through Black Bird, we manufacture and sell CBD products, including CBD Oils, gummies and pet treats, and CBD-infused personal care products, as well as hand sanitizer gel and spray products, under the Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name. In addition, Black Bird is a licensed grower of industrial hemp under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program and has established “Black Bird American Hemp” as the brand name under which these efforts will be conducted.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance
Following our acquisition of Black Bird, our future operating results can be expected to be primarily affected by the following factors:
·
our ability to attract and retain customers for our Grizzly Creek Naturals, and other, products;
·
our ability to produce and sell hemp products;
·
our ability to maintain the value proposition of MiteXstream, once certified as a biopesticide, vis-a-vis other
·
available pest control products; and
·
our ability to contain our operating costs.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”) and 2019 (“Fiscal 2019”). During Fiscal 2020, our business operations generated $57,604 in revenues from sales of our Grizzly Creek Naturals products with a cost of goods sold of $28,245, resulting in a gross profit of $29,359. During Fiscal 2019, our company did not generate any revenues. During Fiscal 2019, Black Bird generated $17,771 in revenues from sales of Grizzly Creek Naturals products with a cost of goods sold of $17,802, resulting in a gross loss of $31.
During Fiscal 2020, we incurred operating expenses of $714,162, which were comprised of $266,640 in consulting services ($23,000 of which was paid by the issuance of common stock), $17,899 in website expenses, $143,310 in legal and professional services, $23,280 for product license, $17,200 in rent, $1,918 in advertising and marketing expense, $4,461 in bad debt expense, $29,788 in beneficial conversion expense and $209,666 in general and administrative expense, resulting in a net loss of $690,158.
During Fiscal 2019, Black Bird incurred operating expenses of $149,642, which were comprised of $48,108 in consulting services ($45,000 of which was paid by the issuance of common stock), $8,471 in website expenses, $32,860 in legal and professional services, $44,762 for product license, $4,461 in bad debt expense and $10,980 in general and administrative expense, resulting in a net loss of $149,373.
We expect that our revenues will increase from quarter to quarter for the foreseeable future. We expect to incur operating losses through at least June 30, 2021, until sales of MiteXstream begin and volumes of our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products increase significantly. Further, because of our current lack of capital and the current lack of brand name awareness of MiteXstream, Grizzly Creek Naturals and Black Bird American Hemp, we cannot predict the levels of our future revenues.
Based on informal testing done by, and discussions with, cannabis (marijuana and industrial hemp) cultivation industry participants, our management believes that MiteXstream will become the most dynamic, fastest growing part of our business. The impact of these operations is expected to arrive beginning in the second quarter of 2021, at the earliest.
Plan of Operation
MiteXstream. Pursuant to the New MiteXstream Agreement with Touchstone, Black Bird possesses the exclusive rights, even as to Touchstone, to manufacture, sell and distribute MiteXstream, an EPA-registered biopesticide (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). The exclusivity granted would be reduced to a status of non-exclusivity, should be fail to manufacture at least 2,500 gallons of concentrate in any year during the term of the MiteXstream Agreement; provided, however, that such minimum required is deemed to have been satisfied through December 31, 2022. We are required to pay Touchstone a royalty of $10 per gallon of MiteXstream manufactured by us or by any sublicensee of ours. For no further consideration, we were granted the rights to use the “MiteXstream” trademark and the “Harnessing the Power of Water” trademark.
Based on informal testing done by, and discussions with, cannabis cultivation industry participants, our management believes that MiteXstream will become the most dynamic, fastest growing part of our business. However, no prediction can be made in this regard.
Effective December 16, 2020, MiteXstream was approved as a biopesticide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). We have begun to seek approval for use of MiteXstream in the various states; the state approval process takes between one and eight months, variously. To date, MiteXstream is approved for sale in Nevada. Until we obtain the required pesticide certification in a state, we will not sell any MiteXstream. In addition, we intend to seek approval of MiteXstream in countries around the world, although no specific time for such actions has been set.
We have begun to market MiteXstream through channels known to our management. However, it is our intention to secure a small number of established distributors through which to sell MiteXstream in the United States. There is no assurance we will be successful in these efforts.
In March 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with IFC Fulfillment Company (“IFC”), a Los Angeles-based export firm, whereby IFC was appointed the exclusive distributor for MiteXstream in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our Director, Jack Jie Qin, a Company director, facilitated the signing of the IFC Agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report, IFC has not made a sales of MiteXstream.
CBD Products. We have created “Grizzly Creek Naturals” as the brand name for our CBD-related products, which are manufactured by our company using CBD purchased from third parties. Once we begin producing commercial quantities of industrial hemp and extracting the CBD therefrom, we will begin to use all of our own CBD and supplement it with CBD from third parties, as necessary.
We have expanded our line of Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products and currently manufacture and sell the following items:
·
CBD Oil: Original, Huckleberry and Cherry Flavors in 100mg, 250mg, 500mg, 1000mg and 2500mg dosages
·
CBD-Infused Body Butter (500mg): Unscented and Huckleberry Scent
·
CBD-Infused Lip Balm (30mg): Huckleberry Scent
·
Bath Bomb with 50mg of CBD: Eucalyptus, Lavender and Citrus Scents
In July 2020, we began sales of CBD gummies on a private-label basis.
Other Products. In April 2020, we began sales of our Grizzly Creek Naturals hand sanitizer to distributors, directly to retail customers and directly to consumers through our website, having completed our initial FDA product listing in March 2020.
Hand Sanitizer. In April 2020, we began to manufacture and sell our Grizzly Creek Naturals hand sanitizer gel and spray products (without CBD) to distributors, directly to retail customers and directly to consumers through our website, having completed our initial FDA product listing in March 2020. As further discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section hereof, since their introduction, demand for our hand sanitizer products has exceeded our ability to produce these products. The primary hindrance to our ability to produce enough hand sanitizer products has been a scarcity of plastic bottles, pumps and caps available to us, which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this scarcity of plastic bottles, pumps and caps to abate during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, but no assurance can be made in this regard.
Products for Animals. In August 2020, we introduced CBD products for dogs under our Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name.
Distribution.
In-House Distribution. Since it began to manufacture and sell its CBD products in mid-2019, Black Bird as self-distributed its products. In December 2020, these distribution efforts we formalized with the formation of Big Sky American. Big Sky American currently distributes the Grizzly Creek Naturals products to approximately 50 retail locations in Western Montana. In December 2020, Big Sky American entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Big Sky APA), whereby it purchased certain distribution-related assets associated with approximately 200 retail locations in Western Montana for $200,000 in cash. The closing under the Big Sky APA occurred in February 2021.
Website. We sell our products to consumers through our website: www.grizzlycreeknaturals.com.
Third-Party Distributors. Since the third quarter of 2019, Black Bird has entered into separate distribution agreements with four distributors. The only one of these distributors who has significantly impacted our sales is Raghorn Distributing (Raghorn). Raghorn has become our largest customer. Raghorn does not distribute our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products. Raghorn is the party from which Big Sky American purchased the distribution assets under the Big Sky APA.
Hemp-Related Activities. We have formed a division of our company that focuses on hemp-related business opportunities under the “Black Bird American Hemp” brand name. Black Bird American Hemp currently seeks to develop industrial hemp processing operations in the State of Montana. In this regard, while Black Bird is a licensed hemp grower in Montana under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program, it is not contemplated that Black Bird will, itself, become a significant grower of hemp.
Proposed Hemp Processing Facility. Should we obtain a maximum offering hereunder, we intend to establish a small hemp processing facility in Montana capable of processing approximately 1,000 acres of hemp on an annual basis. There is no assurance that we will ever possess sufficient funds with which to establish the proposed hemp processing facility.
Products. Should the proposed hemp processing facility commence operations, Black Bird American Hemp intends to sell, for its own account or for processing customers’ accounts, the products derived from the proposed hemp processing facility’s operations, including, without limitation, bast, hurd, hemp oil, hemp seeds and hemp hearts. The potential applications and, thus, target markets for Black Bird American Hemp’s products include bast, hurd and hemp flower.
Sales and Distribution. Black Bird American Hemp will market hemp products directly to end-users of such products and will seek distributors who are able to demonstrate an ability to develop robust sales of Black Bird American Hemp’s products.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Capital Sources.
Third-Party Loans. In April 2020, our company obtained a total of $50,000 in loans from two third parties ($25,000 from each). In consideration of each loan, we issued a $25,000 face amount convertible promissory note that bears interest at 10% per annum, with principal and interest due in January 2021. Each such convertible promissory note may be converted into shares of our common stock at the rate of one share for each $.001 of debt converted anytime after August 30, 2020. In November 2020, one of such $25,000 face amount convertible promissory notes, including $3,000 in accrued interest, was paid in full. The remaining $25,000 loan is past due, as of the date of this Annual Report.
In December 2020, our company obtained a loan from a third party which netted us $50,000 in proceeds. In consideration of such loan, we issued a $58,600 face amount convertible promissory note, with OID of $4,100, that bears interest at 10% per annum, with principal and interest due in September 2021. We have the right to repay such convertible promissory note at a premium ranging from 120% to 145% of the face amount. Such convertible promissory note may be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of 60% of the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of such convertible promissory note and the date of conversion, any time after June 15, 2021.
In January 2021, our company obtained a loan from a third party which netted us $52,000 in proceeds. In consideration of such loan, we issued a $55,500 face amount convertible promissory note that bears interest at 12% per annum, with principal and interest due in January 2022. We have the right to repay such convertible promissory note at a premium ranging from 125% to 145% of the face amount. Such convertible promissory note may be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of 61% of the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of such convertible promissory note and the date of conversion, any time after July 14, 2021.
In February 2021, our company obtained a loan from a third party which netted us $106,000 in proceeds. In consideration of such loan, we issued a $121,000.00 face amount promissory note, with OID of $15,000, that bears interest at 9% per annum, with principal and interest payable in eight equal monthly payments of $15,125 beginning in August 2021. We have the right to repay such promissory note at any time. Should we default on such promissory note, it becomes convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of the lowest closing bid price of our commons stock for the trading day immediately preceding either (a) the delivery of a notice of default, (b) the delivery of a notice of conversion resulting from such default or (c) the issue date of such promissory note.
In February 2021, our company obtained a loan from a third party which netted us $43,500 in proceeds. In consideration of such loan, we issued a $43,500 face amount convertible promissory note that bears interest at 12% per annum, with principal and interest due in February 2022. We have the right to repay such convertible promissory note at a premium ranging from 125% to 145% of the face amount. Such convertible promissory note may be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of 61% of the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of such convertible promissory note and the date of conversion, any time after August 17, 2021.
Regulation A Offering. In May 2020, our company filed an Offering Statement on Form 1-A (File No. 254-11215) (the “Regulation A Offering”) with SEC with respect to 70,000,000 shares of common stock, as amended, which was qualified by the SEC on August 4, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold a total of 13,200,000 shares of common stock for a total of $528,000 in cash, under the Regulation A Offering. Since December 31, 2020, we have sold a total of 4,875,000 shares of its common stock for a total of $195,000, or $.04 per share, in cash, under the Regulation A Offering. There is no assurance that we will further derive any funds pursuant to the Regulation A Offering.
December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, our company had $52,974 in cash and working capital of $7,610, compared to $973 in cash and a working capital deficit of $1,140,795 at December 31, 2019. The significant change in our working capital position from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, is attributable primarily to (1) the cancellation of $1,133,097 of debt in exchange for shares of our common stock, pursuant to three separate agreements with related parties and (2) $530,500 in proceeds from sales of our common stock, including $528,000 derived from the Regulation A Offering.
During the Current Period, we obtained net advances $4,470 from a related party with which to pay certain operating expenses, including $3,000 in fees of our former auditor.
Transactions Relating to the Black Bird Acquisition. In connection with our acquisition of Black Bird, we consummated a stock cancellation agreement with a related party and three separate debt forgiveness agreements with related parties, as follows:
Stock Cancellation Agreement. We entered into this agreement with our former majority shareholder, EFT Holdings, Inc., whereby we cancelled all 79,265,000 shares of common stock then owned by EFT Holdings, Inc. The total stated capital and additional paid-in capital associated with such shares is $79,265 (unaudited), and is a reduction of our shareholders’ equity.
Debt Forgiveness Agreements. We entered into three separate debt forgiveness agreements with related parties:
EFT Holdings, Inc.: we issued 18,221,906 shares of common stock to our former majority shareholder, EFT Holdings, Inc., in payment of $886,108 of indebtedness, principal and accrued interest.
EF2T, Inc.: we issued 2,240,768 shares of common stock to a related party, EF2T, Inc., in payment of $109,992 of indebtedness, principal and accrued interest.
Astonia LLC: we issued 2,831,661 shares of common stock to a related party, Astonia LLC, in payment of $136,997 of indebtedness, principal and accrued interest.
Our company’s current cash position of approximately $50,000 is adequate for our company to maintain its present level of operations through the remainder 2021. However, we must obtain additional capital from third parties to implement our full business plans. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital.
December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, Black Bird had $85,969 in cash and working capital of $114,945, compared to $37,662 in cash and working capital of $37,662 at December 31, 2018. From its inception in October 2018 through December 31, 2019, Black Bird derived a total of $217,250 in cash from sales of its common stock.
Inflation
We do not expect that inflation will significantly affect our results of operations.
Seasonality
As sales of MiteXstream begin during the second quarter of 2021, we expect that our operating results will be impacted by the seasonality of farming operations. However, we are currently unable to predict the level to which such seasonality will impact our business.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into operating leases for two facilities, as follows:
Contractual Obligations
To date, we have entered into a single long-term lease obligation that require us to make monthly payments of $1,500 through 2025.
Capital Expenditures
We made no capital expenditures during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019. Without obtaining additional capital, we will not be able to make any capital expenditures.
