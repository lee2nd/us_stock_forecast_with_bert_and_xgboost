ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in Part II of this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our assumptions about the future of our business. Our actual results will likely differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information regarding forward-looking statements used in this Annual Report.
Overview
We are an operator of professional networks with a focus on diversity, employment, education and training. We use the term “diversity” (or “diverse”) to describe communities, or “affinities,” that are distinct based on a wide array of criteria, including ethnic, national, cultural, racial, religious or gender classification. We serve a variety of such communities, including Women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Disabled, Military Professionals, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ).
We currently operate in two business segments: (i) Professional Diversity Network (“PDN Network”), which includes online professional networking communities with career resources tailored to the needs of various diverse cultural groups and employers looking to hire members of such groups, and (ii) National Association of Professional Women (“NAPW Network”), a women-only professional networking organization.
Our value proposition is simple: (i) we provide a robust online and in-person network for our women members to make professional and personal connections for our diverse audience of women: African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Veterans, individuals with disabilities and members of the gay community (with the ability to roll out to our other affinities); (ii) we assist our registered users, or members, in their efforts to connect with like-minded individuals and identify career opportunities within the network; and (iii) we help employers address their workforce diversity needs by connecting them with the right candidates. We believe that the combination of our solutions allows us to approach recruiting and professional networking in a unique way and thus create enhanced value for our members and customers.
On March 4, 2020, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) decided to discontinue all operations in China. The resolution approved by our Board was to effectively cease and discontinue operations. Accordingly, all historical financial results associated with our China operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations and current and prior period financial results have been reclassified to conform. China operations were previously disclosed as a reportable operating segment as “China Operations.”
Sources of Revenue
We generate revenue from (i) paid membership subscriptions and related services, (ii) recruitment services, (iii) product sales, (iv) education and training and (v) consumer advertising and consumer marketing solutions. The following table sets forth our revenues from each product as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Membership Fees and Related Services. We offer paid membership subscriptions through our NAPW Network, a women-only professional networking organization, operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary. Members gain access to networking opportunities through a members-only website at www.iawomen.com and “virtual” eChapter events which occur in a webcast setting as well as through in-person networking at approximately over a 100 local chapters nationwide, additional career and networking events such as the National Networking Summit Series, Power Networking Events and the PDN Network events. NAPW members also receive ancillary (non-networking) benefits such as educational discounts, shopping, and other membership perks. The basic package is the Initiator level, which provides online benefits only. Upgrades to an Innovator membership include the Initiator benefits as well as membership in local chapters, and access to live in-person events. The most comprehensive level, the Influencer, provides all the aforementioned benefits plus admission to exclusive “live” events and expanded opportunities for marketing and promotion, including the creation and distribution of a press release, which is prepared by professional writers and sent over major newswires. Additionally, all memberships offer educational programs with discounts or at no cost, based on the membership level. NAPW Membership is renewable and fees are payable on an annual or monthly basis, with the first fee payable at the commencement of the membership.
Recruitment Services. We provide recruitment services through PDN Network to medium and large employers seeking to diversify their employment ranks. Our recruitment services include recruitment advertising, job postings, semantic search technology and paid access to, and placement in, or advertising around our career and networking events. The majority of recruitment services revenue comes from job recruitment advertising. We also offer to businesses subject to the regulations and requirements of the Equal Employment Opportunity Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program (“OFCCP”) our OFCCP compliance product, which combines diversity recruitment advertising with job postings and compliance services.
Product Sales and Other. We offer to new purchasers of our NAPW memberships the opportunity to purchase a commemorative wall plaque at the time of purchase. They may purchase up to two plaques at that time.
Consumer Advertising and Marketing Solutions. We work with partner organizations to provide them with integrated job boards on their websites which offer their members or customers the ability to post recruitment advertising and job openings. We generate revenue from fees charged for those postings.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs of producing job fair and other events, revenue sharing with partner organizations, costs of web hosting and operating our websites for the PDN Network. Costs of producing wall plaques, hosting member conferences and local chapter meetings are also included in the cost of revenue for NAPW Network.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Adjusted EBITDA
We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by financial analysts and others to measure operating performance. Furthermore, management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure may provide investors with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business. However, while we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of operating performance, Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, may not be comparable to EBITDA, or similarly titled measures, as defined by other companies.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the most directly comparable GAAP measure as reported in the consolidated financial statements:
Results of Operations
Revenues
Total Revenues
The following tables set forth our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Total revenues decreased $568,000, or 11.3%, from $5,025,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4,457,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a $1,082,000 or 44.6% decline in membership fees and related services, partially offset by $511,000 or a 20.8% increase in recruitment service revenues.
Revenues by Segment
The following table sets forth each operating segment’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our PDN Network generated $3,106,000 in revenues compared to $2,592,000 in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $514,000 or 19.8%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to improvements in our e-commerce platform and new sales collaborations, higher new client acquisitions and a significant increase in diversity recruitment initiatives by our clients during the second half of 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our NAPW Network revenues were $1,351,000, compared to revenues of $2,433,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,082,000 or 44.5%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due a continued decrease in legacy membership retention rates and the continued effects of COVID-19 as new membership enrollment significantly declined throughout 2020. We believe that the membership services that we provide to our customers turned into a discretionary spending item during 2020 and the services that we provide were postponed as a result of the financial and economic impact of COVID-19.
Costs and Expenses
The following tables set forth our costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Total costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $9,301,000 compared to $8,021,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1,280,000 or 16.0% increase in costs and expenses was primarily attributable to a $2,155,000 increase in general and administrative expenses associated with higher share-based compensation expense, bad debt reserves, legal expense and litigation settlement reserves, partially offset by a decrease of $534,000 in depreciation and amortization expense and a $244,000 decrease in sales and marketing expenses due to lower salaries and benefit expenses.
Costs and Expenses by Segment
The following table sets forth each operating segment’s costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Costs and expenses decreased $41,000, or 1.4%, in our PDN Network during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $114,000 in lower selling and marketing personnel costs and a $52,000 decrease in event and facility costs due to the elimination of in-person recruiting events due to COVID-19, which was partially offset by a $139,000 increase in bad debt expense.
Costs and expenses decreased $812,000, or 30.0%, in our NAPW Network during the year ended December 31 2020 primarily as a result of a $492,000 decrease in intangible amortization expense and a $319,000 reduction in personnel costs.
Corporate overhead expenses increased $2,133,000 or 90.2% during the year December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of $1,167,000 in litigation settlement reserves, $722,000 in higher legal fees and $396,000 in higher non-cash share-based compensation, which was partially offset by $304,000 in lower administrative salaries and benefits expense.
Operating Expenses
Cost of revenues: Cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $787,000, a decrease of $97,000, or 11.0%, from $884,000, during the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of an $82,000 decrease in event and facility costs due to the elimination of in-person recruiting events in our PDN Network due to COVID-19.
Sales and marketing expense: Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,915,000, a decrease of $244,000, or 11.3%, from $2,159,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is mainly attributable to a $257,000 reduction in the personnel costs, partially offset by a $16,000 increase in consulting fees.
General and administrative expense: General and administrative expenses increased $2,155,000, or 50.4%, to $6,429,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to general and administrative expenses of $4,274,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily the result of $1,947,000 in legal settlement reserves associated with settlements and court awarded judgements recorded in the current year, $396,000 in higher non-cash share-based compensation expenses associated with restricted stock awards and a $139,000 increase in bad debt expense, which was partially offset by a $482,000 reduction in personnel and benefit costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense: Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $170,000, compared to $704,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $534,000, or 75.9%. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower amortization expense associated with a $2,796,000 impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 against long-lived intangible assets in our NAPW Network, which effectively lower future amortization expenses.
Other Income (Expenses)
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $652,000, compared to other income of $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in other income during the current year was primarily due to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan forgiveness we received from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) in the fourth quarter of 2020. Due to the financial and economic impact of COVID-19, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 and among the provisions contained in the CARES Act was the creation of the PPP that provided SBA loans for qualified small businesses and the loan proceeds were intended to be used for payroll costs, group health care benefits, rent, utilities and certain other operating related expenses. We applied for the PPP loan and on May 5, 2020, we received total proceeds of $651,077 from the SBA. In accordance with the loan forgiveness requirements under the CARES Act, we utilized the proceeds from the PPP loan for payroll costs, rent and utilities.
We applied for loan forgiveness during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the PPP loan was fully forgiven by the SBA. Prior to loan forgiveness, we had recorded the receipts under the PPP loan as a short-term and long-term loan in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon receiving loan forgiveness, we eliminated the short-term and long-term loan liability and the loan amount of $651,077 was reflected as PPP loan forgiveness in other income in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Income Tax Benefit
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a benefit for income tax of $35,000 and $177,000. The decrease in income tax benefit during the current period was primarily due to a decrease in tax rates pursuant to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in January 2018 year in addition to a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities in the current year.
Discontinued Operations
In March 2020, our Board of Directors decided to suspend all operations in China. The results for operations of China are presented in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss as loss from discontinued operations.
The following table presents results from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Net loss
The following table sets forth each operating segment’s net income or loss for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Consolidated Net Loss from Continuing Operations. As the result of the factors discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss of $4,158,000 from continuing operations, an increase of $1,366,000 or 48.9% from a net loss of $2,792,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,118,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $634,000 at December 31, 2019. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, including net proceeds from the issuances of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,156,000, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $2,114,000 as of December 31, 2019. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $93,023,000 at December 31, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $4,158,000 and 2,792,000 and used cash from continuing operations of approximately $3,337,000 and 3,290,000.
During 2020, we continued our focus on cost cutting initiatives and have continued our focus on improving our overall profitability though new sales and marking initiatives and through business collaborations, however, we have continued to generate negative cash flows from operations and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to further implement our business plan, raise capital, make strategic acquisitions and generate organic growth in revenues from our existing operating segments. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we unable to continue as a going concern.
On March 22, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Malven Group Limited, a company established under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Malven”), in connection with the purchase by Malven of 1,939,237 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.7735 per share for gross proceeds of $1,500,000. The closing of the transaction took place on March 31, 2020. On June 26, 2020, we entered into a second agreement with Malven, in connection with the purchase of 312,500 shares of common stock at a price of $3.20 per share for gross proceeds of $1,000,000. The closing of the transaction took place on June 29, 2020 and we received the funds in July 2020.
On July 27, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with three institutional accredited investors. Pursuant to the Agreement, we offered and sold 1,481,484 shares of our common stock at a per share price of $1.35 for gross proceeds of approximately $2,000,000. The transaction closed on July 29, 2020 and we received net proceeds of $1,814,353, after deducting financial advisory, legal and escrow related fees.
On February 1, 2021, we entered into a private placement with Ms. Yiran Gu, in which the Company sold 500,000 shares of its common stock at a price per share of $2.00 for gross proceeds of $1,000,000.
We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the twelve months subsequent to the issuance of our interim financial information. In order to fund our operations, we will need to increase revenues or raise capital by the issuance of common stock. However, there can be no assurances that our business plans and actions will be successful, that we will generate anticipated revenues, or that unforeseen circumstances similar to COVID-19 will not require additional funding sources in the future or effectuate plans to conserve liquidity. Future efforts to raise additional funds may not be successful or they may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
We collect membership fees generally at the commencement of the membership term or at renewal periods thereafter. The memberships we sell are for one year and we defer recognition of the revenue from membership sales and renewals and recognize it ratably over the twelve-month period. Starting January 2, 2018, we also offer a monthly membership for IAW USA for which we collect a fee on a monthly basis. Our PDN Network also sells recruitment services to employers, generally on a one-year contract basis. This revenue is also deferred and recognized over the life of the contract. Our payment terms for PDN Network customers range from 30 to 60 days. We consider the difference between the payment terms and payment receipts a result of transit time for invoice and payment processing and to date have not experienced any liquidity issues as a result of the payments extending past the specified terms. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include all short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,337,000.

Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations was $3,183,594, which primarily consisted of the funds in PDN China’s frozen bank account due to the Gatewang Case.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $65,000, which consisted primarily of a security deposit on our new office lease of $66,000, $10,000 associated with the purchases of computer equipment and $4,000 in costs associated with internally developed technology. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $3,000 and consisted of investments in internally developed technology.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
We base our estimates on our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic conditions, the attributes of our products, the regulatory environment, and in certain cases, the results of outside appraisals. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accounts Receivable
Our policy is to reserve for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis (December 31 for the Company) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company considers its market capitalization and the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including goodwill, when performing its goodwill impairment test.
When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then compares the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will measure any goodwill impairment losses as the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Capitalized Technology Costs
We account for capitalized technology costs in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software (“ASC 350-40”). In accordance with ASC 350-40, we capitalize certain external and internal computer software costs incurred during the application development stage. The application development stage generally includes software design and configuration, coding, testing and installation activities. Training and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that such expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software assets on a straight-line basis, generally not exceeding three years.
Business Combinations
ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations to all acquisitions where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer : a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
Revenue Recognition
Our principal sources of revenue are recruitment revenue, consumer marketing and consumer advertising revenue, membership subscription fees, and product sales. Recruitment revenue includes revenue recognized from direct sales to customers for recruitment services and events, as well as revenue from our direct ecommerce sales. Revenues from recruitment services are recognized when the services are performed, evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. Our recruitment revenue is derived from agreements through single and multiple job postings, recruitment media, talent recruitment communities, basic and premier corporate memberships, hiring campaign marketing and advertising, e-newsletter marketing and research and outreach services.
Consumer marketing and consumer advertising revenue is recognized either based upon a fixed fee for revenue sharing agreements in which payment is required at the time of posting, or billed based upon the number of impressions (the number of times an advertisement is displayed) recorded on the websites as specified in the customer agreement.
Revenue generated from NAPW Network membership subscriptions is recognized ratably over the 12-month membership period, although members pay their annual fees at the commencement of the membership period. Starting January 2, 2018, we also offer a monthly membership for which we collect fees on a monthly basis and we recognize revenue in the same month as the fees are collected. Revenue from related membership services are derived from fees for development and set-up of a member’s personal on-line profile and/or press release announcements. Fees related to these services are recognized as revenue at the time the on-line profile is complete and press release is distributed.
