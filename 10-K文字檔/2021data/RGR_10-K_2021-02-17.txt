ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Company Overview
Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (the “Company”) is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. Approximately 99% of sales are from firearms. Export sales represent approximately 5% of total sales. The Company’s design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic. The Company’s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.
The Company also manufactures investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (“MIM”) parts for internal use in its firearms and for sale to unaffiliated, third-party customers. Approximately 1% of sales are from the castings segment.
Orders of many models of firearms from the independent distributors tend to be stronger in the first quarter of the year and weaker in the third quarter of the year. This is due in part to the timing of the distributor show season, which occurs during the first quarter.
Impact of Covid-19
The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and adversely impacted many industries throughout the global economy. In 2020, the Company was able to mitigate the adverse impact on its business resulting from government restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and, therefore, the Company cannot predict the extent to which its business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows will ultimately be impacted. Management continues to monitor and assess the situation and to prepare for potential implications for the Company’s business, supply chain and customer demand.
From a liquidity perspective, the Company believes it is currently well positioned to manage through this global crisis. At the end of 2020, the Company was debt-free, and had cash and short-term investments totaling $141.2 million and an unused $40.0 million revolving credit facility.
The Company has taken many proactive steps to maintain the health and safety of its employees and to mitigate the impact on its business. These actions include:
•
Providing all hourly employees with an additional two weeks of paid time off,
•
Encouraging employees to work remotely, wherever possible, and implementing social distancing throughout each manufacturing facility, including in every manufacturing cell,
•
Communicating with and assisting employees with potential health issues,
•
Restricting visitor access to avoid introducing new people to the factory environment,
•
Implementing additional cleaning, sanitizing and other health and safety processes to maintain a clean and safe workplace, and
•
Manufacturing and donating personal protective equipment to local hospitals, health care facilities, and police and fire departments in its local communities.
The costs of these actions totaled approximately $3.6 million in 2020. The Company has also experienced expense reductions and deferrals in certain areas of our business, including reductions or delays in sponsorships and advertising, reduced conference and trade show participation costs, and reduced travel expenditures. These expense reductions and deferrals approximated $2.9 million in 2020.
The Company has been able to keep all of its facilities safe and open with only limited restrictions on operations. While certain parts of the economy have begun to reopen as restrictions have been lifted, it is possible that additional restrictions will be put in place in the future which could adversely impact the Company’s business for an indeterminate period.
Since the latter stages of the first quarter of 2020, there has been a significant increase in consumer demand for firearms, as evidenced by the increase in adjusted National Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) checks. This increased demand may be attributable, in part, to COVID-19. The sustainability of this increased consumer demand, and the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand, cannot be predicted at this time.
The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The Company estimates that COVID related costs of $1.5 million to $3 million will be incurred in 2021.
Results of Operations - 2020
Product Demand
The estimated sell-through of the Company’s products from the independent distributors to retailers in 2020 increased 44% from 2019. For the same period, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) background checks (as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (“NSSF”)) increased 60%.
These substantial increases may be attributable to increased public concern about personal protection and home defense in reaction to:
•
Some political and public leaders calling for a reduction in funding and limitations on law enforcement activities,
•
Protests, demonstrations, and civil unrest in many cities throughout the United States,
•
The continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and
•
Concern about possible legislation that could curtail or limit gun ownership rights by both state and Federal governments.
New products represented $111.2 million or 22% of firearms sales in 2020, compared to $102.0 million or 26% of firearms sales in 2019. New product sales include only major new products that were introduced in the past two years. In 2020, new products included the Wrangler revolver, the Ruger-57 pistol, the LCP II in .22 LR pistol, the PC Charger, and the AR-556 pistol.
Estimated sell-through from distributors to retailers and total adjusted NICS background checks:
(1)
The estimates for each period were calculated by taking the beginning inventory at the distributors, plus shipments from the Company to distributors during the period, less the ending inventory at distributors. These estimates are only a proxy for actual market demand as they:
•
Rely on data provided by independent distributors that are not verified by the Company,
•
Do not consider potential timing issues within the distribution channel, including goods-in-transit, and
•
Do not consider fluctuations in inventory at retail.
(2)
NICS background checks are performed when the ownership of most firearms, either new or used, is transferred by a Federal Firearms Licensee. NICS background checks are also performed for permit applications, permit renewals, and other administrative reasons.
The adjusted NICS data presented above was derived by the NSSF by subtracting NICS checks that are not directly related to the sale of a firearm, including checks used for concealed carry (“CCW”) permit application checks as well as checks on active CCW permit databases.
Adjusted NICS data can be impacted by changes in state laws and regulations and any directives and interpretations issued by governmental agencies. For example, the use of state issued permits to carry firearms, in lieu of NICS background checks, for certain transactions was significantly curtailed in 2020. This resulted in increases in adjusted NICS background checks for Alabama and Michigan of 95% and 180%, respectively. Excluding these states, adjusted NICS increased 56%, compared with a reported increase of 60%, in 2020.
Orders Received and Ending Backlog
The Company uses the estimated unit sell-through of our products from the independent distributors to retailers, along with inventory levels at the independent distributors and at the Company, as the key metrics for planning production levels.
Orders Received in 2020 increased 149% from 2019. Our ending order backlog of 1,511,900 units at December 31, 2020 increased 1,324,000 units from a backlog of 187,900 units at December 31, 2019.
The units ordered, value of orders received and ending backlog, net of Federal Excise Tax, for the trailing three years are as follows (dollars in millions, except average sales price):
Production
The Company reviews the estimated sell-through from the independent distributors to retailers, as well as inventory levels at the independent distributors and at the Company, semi-monthly to plan production levels and manage inventories. These reviews resulted in an increase in total unit production of 26% in 2020 compared to 2019. Reduced hiring to help maintain the health and safety of employees and the cleanliness of our facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted production in 2020.
Annual Summary Unit Data
Firearms unit data for orders, production, and shipments follows:
Inventories
The Company’s finished goods inventory decreased by 58,600 units during 2020.
Distributor inventories of the Company’s products decreased by 231,200 units during 2020 and are significantly below the level needed to support rapid fulfillment of retailer demand. In the aggregate, total Company and distributor inventories decreased by 86% in 2020.
Inventory data follows:

Distributor ending inventory as provided by the independent distributors of the Company’s products. These numbers do not include goods-in-transit inventory that has been shipped from the Company but not yet received by the distributors.
(4)
This total does not include inventory at retailers. The Company does not have access to data on retailer inventories.
Year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to year ended December 31, 2019:
Net Sales
Consolidated net sales were $568.9 million in 2020. This represents an increase of $158.4 million or 38.6% from 2019 consolidated net sales of $410.5 million.
Firearms segment net sales were $565.9 million in 2020. This represents an increase of $159.6 million or 39.3% from 2019 firearms net sales of $406.3 million. Firearms unit shipments increased 29.5% in 2020.
Casting segment net sales were $3.0 million in 2020. This represents a decrease of $1.2 million or 28.1% from 2019 casting sales of $4.2 million.
Cost of Products Sold and Gross Profit
Consolidated cost of products sold was $377.4 million in 2020. This represents an increase of $66.4 million or 21.4% from 2019 consolidated cost of products sold of $311.0 million.
The gross margin was 33.7% in 2020. This represents an increase from 24.3% in 2019 as illustrated below:
Cost of products sold, before LIFO, overhead and labor rate adjustments to inventory, product liability, and product safety bulletins and recalls- In 2020, cost of products sold, before LIFO, overhead and labor rate adjustments to inventory, product liability and safety bulletins and recalls decreased 10.5% as a percentage of sales compared to 2019. This decrease was due primarily to to the significant increase in sales and production which resulted in favorable leveraging of fixed costs and a reduction in promotional activities.
LIFO- The Company recognized LIFO expense in 2020 and 2019 of $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which increased cost of products sold in both periods.
Overhead Rate Change- The net impact on inventory in 2020 and 2019 from the change in the overhead rates used to absorb overhead expenses into inventory was a decrease of $0.5 million and an increase of $3.7 million, respectively, reflecting increased overhead efficiency in 2020 and decreased overhead efficiency in 2019. The increase in inventory value in 2020 resulted in a corresponding decrease to cost of products sold and the decrease in inventory value in 2019 resulted in a corresponding increase to cost of products sold.
Labor Rate Adjustments- In 2020, the change in inventory value resulting from the change in the labor rates used to absorb labor expenses into inventory was a decrease of $0.3 million, reflecting increased labor efficiency. This decrease in inventory value resulted in a corresponding increase to cost of products sold. In 2019, the change in inventory value resulting from the change in the labor rates used to absorb labor expenses into inventory was an increase of $0.4 million, reflecting decreased labor efficiency. This increase in inventory value resulted in a corresponding decrease to cost of products sold.
Product Liability- This expense includes the cost of outside legal fees, insurance, and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters. These costs totaled $1.1 million and $0.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 20 in the notes to the financial statements “Contingent Liabilities” for further discussion of the Company’s product liability.
Product Safety Bulletins and Recalls- In October 2018, the Company issued a safety bulletin announcing that some Ruger American Pistols chambered in 9mm may exhibit premature wear of the locking surfaces between the slide and barrel. The Company offered a free retrofit to customers of affected pistols and recorded a $1.0 million expense in 2018, which was the expected total cost of the safety bulletin. In 2019 and 2020, the estimated costs remaining for the product safety bulletin was reduced, which decreased cost of sales by $0.2 million and $0.9 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Gross Profit- Gross profit was $191.4 million or 33.7% of sales in 2020. This is an increase of $91.9 million from 2019 gross profit of $99.5 million or 24.3% of sales in 2019.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.3 million in 2020, an increase of $12.2 million from $60.1 million in 2019, and a decrease from 14.6% of sales in 2019 to 12.7% of sales in 2020. The increase in expense was primarily attributable to increased sales and incentive compensation expenses and the decrease in the percentage of sales was attributable to the significant increase in sales.
Other Operating Income, net
Other operating income, net was de minimis in 2020 and 2019.
Operating Income
Operating income was $119.1 million or 20.9% of sales in 2020. This is an increase of $79.7 million from 2019 operating income of $39.4 million or 9.6% of sales.
Royalty Income
Royalty income was $0.8 million in 2020 and $0.7 million in 2019.
Interest Income
Interest income was $1.1 million in 2020, a decrease of $1.5 million from $2.6 million in 2019, due to decreased interest rates earned on short-term investments in 2020.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $0.2 million and $0.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net was $0.1 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.5 million from $0.6 million in 2019.
Income Taxes and Net Income
The effective income tax rate was 25.3% in 2020 and 25.0% in 2019.
As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income was $90.4 million in 2020. This represents an increase of $58.1 million from 2019 consolidated net income of $32.3 million.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding its results, the Company refers to various United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures and one non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA, which management believes provides useful information to investors. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. In addition, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying business, as EBITDA provides information on the Company’s ability to meet its capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and is also an indicator of profitability. The Company believes that this reporting provides better transparency and comparability to its operating results. The Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its financial performance.
Non-GAAP Reconciliation - EBITDA
EBITDA
(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company calculates this by adding the amount of interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expenses that have been deducted from net income back into net income, and subtracting the amount of interest income that was included in net income from net income to arrive at EBITDA. The Company’s EBITDA calculation also excludes any one-time non-cash, non-operating expense.

Results of Operations - 2019
Year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to year ended December 31, 2018:
Annual Summary Unit Data
Firearms unit data for orders, production, shipments and ending inventory, and castings setups (a measure of foundry production) are as follows:
Orders Received and Ending Backlog
(in millions except average sales price, net of Federal Excise Tax):
(1)
Distributor ending inventory as provided by the independent distributors of the Company’s products.
(2)
Average sales price for orders received and ending backlog is net of Federal Excise Tax of 10% for handguns and 11% for long guns.
Product Demand
The estimated sell-through of the Company’s products from the independent distributors to retailers in 2019 decreased 18% from 2018. For the same period, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) background checks (as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (“NSSF”)) increased 1%. The greater reduction in the sell-through of the Company’s products relative to adjusted NICS background checks may be attributable to the following:
•
More aggressive promotions, discounts, rebates and the extension of payment terms offered by our competitors,
•
The loss of a formerly significant distributor that ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2019 and the market disruption caused by the subsequent liquidation of its inventory of Ruger products,
•
The loss of three additional smaller distributors in the second half of 2019,
•
An apparent increase in sales of used firearms at retail, which are captured by adjusted NICS checks, and
•
Decreased retailer inventories as the anticipation of further discounting continues to encourage cautious buying behavior by retailers.
New products represented $102.0 million or 26% of firearms sales in 2019, compared to $145.6 million or 30% of firearms sales in 2018. New product sales include only major new products that were introduced in the past two years. In 2019, new products included the Pistol Caliber Carbine, the Wrangler, the Ruger-57, the Precision Rimfire Rifle, the AR pistol, the Security-9 pistol, the LCP II in .22, and the EC9s pistol.
Estimated sell-through from distributors to retailers and total adjusted NICS background checks:
(1)
The estimates for each period were calculated by taking the beginning inventory at the distributors, plus shipments from the Company to distributors during the period, less the ending inventory at distributors. These estimates are only a proxy for actual market demand as they:
•
 Rely on data provided by independent distributors that are not verified by the Company,
•
 Do not consider potential timing issues within the distribution channel, including goods-in-transit, and
•
 Do not consider fluctuations in inventory at retail.
(2)
NICS background checks are performed when the ownership of most firearms, either new or used, is transferred by a Federal Firearms Licensee. NICS background checks are also performed for permit applications, permit renewals, and other administrative reasons.
The adjusted NICS data presented above was derived by the NSSF by subtracting NICS checks that are not directly related to the sale of a firearm, including checks used for concealed carry (“CCW”) permit application checks as well as checks on active CCW permit databases.
Adjusted NICS data can be impacted by changes in state laws and regulations and any directives and interpretations issued by governmental agencies. For example, the use of state issued permits to carry firearms, in lieu of NICS background checks, for certain transactions was significantly curtailed in 2019. This resulted in increases in adjusted NICS background checks for Alabama and Minnesota of 66% and 33%, respectively. Excluding Alabama and Minnesota, adjusted NICS decreased 1% in 2019.
Production
The Company reviews the estimated sell-through from the independent distributors to retailers, as well as inventory levels at the independent distributors and at the Company, semi-monthly to plan production levels and manage inventories. These reviews resulted in a decrease in total unit production of 18% in 2019 compared to 2018.
Inventories
The Company’s finished goods inventory decreased by 12,900 units during 2019.
Distributor inventories of the Company’s products decreased by 29,300 units during 2019 and approximate a reasonable level to support rapid fulfillment of retailer demand. In the aggregate, total Company and distributor inventories decreased by 11% in 2019.
Inventory data follows:

(in millions except average sales price, net of Federal Excise Tax)
Net Sales
Consolidated net sales were $410.5 million in 2019. This represents a decrease of $85.1 million or 17.2% from 2018 consolidated net sales of $495.6 million.
Firearms segment net sales were $406.3 million in 2019. This represents a decrease of $84.3 million or 17.2% from 2018 firearms net sales of $490.6 million. Firearms unit shipments decreased 19% in 2019.
Casting segment net sales were $4.2 million in 2019. This represents a decrease of $0.8 million or 16.9% from 2018 casting sales of $5.0 million.
Cost of Products Sold and Gross Profit
Consolidated cost of products sold was $311.0 million in 2019. This represents a decrease of $50.3 million or 13.9% from 2018 consolidated cost of products sold of $361.3 million.
The gross margin was 24.3% in 2019. This represents a decrease from 27.1% in 2018 as illustrated below:
(in thousands)
Cost of products sold, before LIFO, overhead and labor rate adjustments to inventory, product liability, and product safety bulletins and recalls- In 2019, cost of products sold, before LIFO, overhead and labor rate adjustments to inventory, product liability and safety bulletins and recalls increased 4.8% as a percentage of sales compared to 2018. This increase was due primarily to the decrease in sales and production which resulted in unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs.
LIFO- The Company recognized LIFO expense in 2019 and 2018 of $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, which increased cost of products sold in both periods.
Overhead Rate Change- The net impact on inventory in 2019 and 2018 from the change in the overhead rates used to absorb overhead expenses into inventory was an increase of $3.7 million and a decrease of $1.8 million, respectively, reflecting decreased overhead efficiency in 2019 and increased overhead efficiency in 2018. The increase in inventory value in 2019 resulted in a corresponding decrease to cost of products sold and the decrease in inventory value in 2018 resulted in a corresponding increase to cost of products sold.
Labor Rate Adjustments- In 2019, the change in inventory value resulting from the change in the labor rates used to absorb labor expenses into inventory was an increase of $0.4 million, reflecting decreased labor efficiency. This increase in inventory value resulted in a corresponding decrease to cost of products sold. In 2018, the change in inventory value resulting from the change in the labor rates used to absorb labor expenses into inventory was a decrease of $0.2 million, reflecting increased labor efficiency. This decrease in inventory value resulted in a corresponding increase to cost of products sold.
Product Liability- This expense includes the cost of outside legal fees, insurance, and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters. These costs totaled $0.7 million and $1.5 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 20 in the notes to the financial statements “Contingent Liabilities” for further discussion of the Company’s product liability.
Product Safety Bulletins and Recalls- In October 2018, the Company issued a safety bulletin announcing that some Ruger American Pistols chambered in 9mm may exhibit premature wear of the locking surfaces between the slide and barrel. The Company offered a free retrofit to customers of affected pistols and recorded a $1.0 million expense in the third quarter of 2018, which was the expected total cost of the safety bulletin. In 2019, the estimated costs remaining for the product safety bulletin was reduced, which decreased cost of sales by $0.2 million in 2019.
Gross Profit- Gross profit was $99.5 million or 24.3% of sales in 2019. This is a decrease of $34.9 million from 2018 gross profit of $134.4 million or 27.1% of sales in 2018.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $60.1 million in 2019, a decrease of $7.3 million from $67.4 million in 2018, and an increase from 13.6% of sales in 2018 to 14.6% of sales in 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in firearms promotional expense and incentive compensation.
Other Operating Income, net
Other operating income, net was de minimis in 2019 and 2018.
Operating Income
Operating income was $39.4 million or 9.6% of sales in 2019. This is a decrease of $27.6 million from 2018 operating income of $67.0 million or 13.5% of sales.
Royalty Income
Royalty income was $0.7 million in 2019 and $0.8 million in 2018.
Interest Income
Interest income was $2.6 million in 2019, an increase of $2.4 million from $0.2 million in 2018, due to interest income on short-term investments in 2019.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $0.2 million and $0.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net was $0.6 million in 2019, a decrease of $0.4 million from $1.0 million in 2018.
Income Taxes and Net Income
The effective income tax rate was 25.0% in 2019 and 25.9% in 2018.
As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income was $32.3 million in 2019. This represents a decrease of $18.6 million from 2018 consolidated net income of $50.9 million.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding its results, the Company refers to various United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures and one non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA, which management believes provides useful information to investors. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. In addition, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying business, as EBITDA provides information on the Company’s ability to meet its capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and is also an indicator of profitability. The Company believes that this reporting provides better transparency and comparability to its operating results. The Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its financial performance.
Non-GAAP Reconciliation - EBITDA
EBITDA
(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company calculates this by adding the amount of interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expenses that have been deducted from net income back into net income, and subtracting the amount of interest income that was included in net income from net income to arrive at EBITDA. The Company’s EBITDA calculation also excludes any one-time non-cash, non-operating expense.
Financial Condition
Liquidity
At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $20.1 million and $121.0 million in short term investments. Our pre-LIFO working capital of $200.6 million, less the LIFO reserve of $48.0 million, resulted in working capital of $152.6 million and a current ratio of 2.9 to 1.
Operations
Cash provided by operating activities was $143.8 million, $49.6 million, and $119.8 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in cash provided in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to significantly increased earnings in 2020, decreased inventories in 2020, and increased employee compensation and benefit accruals in 2020.
The decrease in cash provided in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to decreased earnings in 2019, an increase in accounts receivable in 2019 compared to a significant decrease in accounts receivable in 2018, and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2019 compared to increases in those accounts in 2018.
Third parties supply the Company with various raw materials for its firearms and castings, such as fabricated steel components, walnut, birch, beech, maple and laminated lumber for rifle stocks, wax, ceramic material, metal alloys, various synthetic products and other component parts. There is a limited supply of these materials in the marketplace at any given time, which can cause the purchase prices to vary based upon numerous market factors. If market conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials cannot be obtained, the Company’s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the Company’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Investing and Financing
Capital expenditures were $24.2 million, $20.3 million, and $10.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In 2021, the Company expects capital expenditures to approximate $20 million, much of which will relate to tooling and fixtures for new product introductions and to upgrade and modernize manufacturing equipment. Due to market conditions and business circumstances, actual capital expenditures could vary significantly from the budgeted amount. The Company finances, and intends to continue to finance, all of these activities with funds provided by operations and current cash.
On November 23, 2020, the Company acquired substantially all of the Marlin Firearms assets, consisting of inventory, machinery and equipment, and intangibles. The agreement to purchase these assets emanated from the Remington Outdoor Company, Inc. bankruptcy and was approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama on September 30, 2020. The purchase price of approximately $28.3 million was paid with available cash on hand. These assets have been moved to the Company’s facilities where manufacturing cells that will produce Marlin rifles will be established. Shipments of Marlin rifles are anticipated in the latter half of 2021.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $121.0 million of United States Treasury instruments which mature within one year.
In 2019, the Company repurchased 44,500 shares of its common stock for $2.0 million in the open market. The average price per share purchased was $44.83. These purchases were funded with cash on hand. No shares were repurchased in 2018 and 2020.
At December 31, 2020, $86.7 million remained authorized for future share repurchases.
The Company paid dividends totaling $113.9 million, $14.3 million, and $19.2 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in the dividends paid in 2020 is attributable to a $5.00 per share special dividend paid in August 2020, and increased earnings compared to prior years. The quarterly dividend varies every quarter because the Company pays a percentage of earnings rather than a fixed amount per share. The Company’s practice is to pay a dividend of approximately 40% of net income.
On February 12, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a dividend of 71¢ per share to shareholders of record on March 12, 2021. The payment of future dividends depends on many factors, including internal estimates of future performance, then-current cash, and the Company’s need for funds.
The Company provides supplemental discretionary contributions to substantially all employees’ individual 401(k) accounts.
Based on its unencumbered assets, the Company believes it has the ability to raise cash through issuance of short-term or long-term debt. The Company’s unsecured $40 million credit facility, which expires on September 30, 2021, remained unused at December 31, 2020 and the Company has no debt.
Contractual Obligations
The table below summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2020, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as current liabilities at December 31, 2020.
“Purchase Obligations” as used in the below table includes all agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Certain of the Company’s purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services that may not necessarily be enforceable or legally binding on the Company are also included in “Purchase Obligations” in the table, and, therefore, certain of the Company’s purchase orders or contracts included in the table may represent authorizations to purchase rather than legally binding agreements. The Company expects to fund all of these commitments with cash flows from operations and current cash.
The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
Firearms Legislation and Litigation
See Item 1A - Risk Factors and Note 20 to the financial statements which are included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of firearms legislation and litigation.
Other Operational Matters
In the normal course of its manufacturing operations, the Company is subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to workplace safety, firearms serial number tracking and control, waste disposal, air emissions and water discharges into the environment. The Company believes that it is generally in compliance with applicable Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, environmental, and safety regulations and the outcome of any proceedings or orders will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. If these regulations become more stringent in the future and we are not able to comply with them, such noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
Since 2018, two of the Company’s independent domestic wholesale distributors filed for bankruptcy protection. Additionally, three of the Company’s smaller independent domestic wholesale distributors discontinued their firearms distribution operations in 2019. Currently, there are 14 domestic distributors. Additionally, the Company has 41 and 26 distributors servicing the export and law enforcement markets, respectively.
The Company self-insures a significant amount of its product liability, workers’ compensation, medical, and other insurance. It also carries significant deductible amounts on various insurance policies.
The Company expects to realize its deferred tax assets through tax deductions against future taxable income.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and net sales and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended. The Company bases estimates on prior experience, facts and circumstances, and other assumptions, including those reviewed with actuarial consultants and independent counsel, when applicable, that are believed to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Company believes the determination of its product liability accrual is a critical accounting policy. The Company’s management reviews every lawsuit and claim and is in contact with independent and corporate counsel on an ongoing basis. The provision for product liability claims is based upon many factors, which vary for each case. These factors include the type of claim, nature and extent of injuries, historical settlement ranges, jurisdiction where filed, and advice of counsel. An accrual is established for each lawsuit and claim, when appropriate, based on the nature of each such lawsuit or claim.
Amounts are charged to product liability expense in the period in which the Company becomes aware that a claim or, in some instances a threat of a claim, has been made when potential losses or costs of defense are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such amounts are determined based on the Company’s experience in defending similar claims. Occasionally, charges are made for claims made in prior periods because the cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim, or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future, exceed amounts already provided with respect to such claims. Likewise, credits may be taken if cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim, or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future, are less than amounts previously provided.
While it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of related costs, in the opinion of management, after consultation with independent and corporate counsel, there is a remote likelihood that litigation, including punitive damage claims, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but such litigation may have a material impact on the Company’s financial results and cash flows for a particular period.
The Company believes the valuation of its inventory and the related excess and obsolescence reserve is also a critical accounting policy. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost, principally determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and prevailing inventory costs existing at that time.
The Company determines its excess and obsolescence reserve by projecting the year in which inventory will be consumed into a finished product. Given ever-changing market conditions, customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products, it does not seem prudent to carry inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next 36 months.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases Topic 842 (“ASC 842”), which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. ASC 842 requires lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) and disclose key information about leasing arrangements, whereas under current standards, the Company’s operating leases were not recognized on its consolidated balance sheet. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases; and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements. ASC 842 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied using either a modified retrospective approach, or an optional transition method which allows an entity to apply the new standard at the adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company adopted ASC 842 in the first quarter of 2019 using this optional transition method. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualified. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the lease portfolio recorded on its consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 was about $2 million, primarily related to real estate. The adoption of this pronouncement did not impact the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or its consolidated statement of cash flows.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new guidance requires financial instruments measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected through application of the current expected credit losses model. The model requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures. The income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2019. The Company has completed its assessment and adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact to the Company.
Forward-Looking Statements and Projections
The Company may, from time to time, make forward-looking statements and projections concerning future expectations. Such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain qualifying risks and uncertainties, such as market demand, sales levels of firearms, anticipated castings sales and earnings, the need for external financing for operations or capital expenditures, the results of pending litigation against the Company, the impact of future firearms control and environmental legislation and accounting estimates, any one or more of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could” and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date such forward-looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of subsequent unanticipated events.
