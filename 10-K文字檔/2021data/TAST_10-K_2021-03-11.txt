Company Overview
Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, "Carrols Restaurant Group", the "Company", "we", "our" or "us") is one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and has been operating restaurants for more than 60 years. We are the largest Burger King® franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King® restaurants since 1976. As of January 3, 2021 we operated, as a franchisee, a total of 1,074 restaurants in 23 states under the trade names of Burger King® and Popeyes®. This included 1,009 Burger King® restaurants in 23 Northeastern, Midwestern, Southcentral and Southeastern states and 65 Popeyes® restaurants in seven Southeastern states.
During the year ended December 29, 2019, we acquired 179 Burger King® restaurants and 55 Popeyes restaurants in three separate transactions which we refer to as the "2019 acquired restaurants". During the year ended December 30, 2018, we acquired 44 Burger King® restaurants in four separate transactions, which we refer to as the "2018 acquired restaurants".
Any reference to "BKC" refers to Burger King Corporation and its indirect parent company, Restaurant Brands International Inc. ("RBI"). Any reference to "PLK" refers to Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. and its indirect parent company, RBI.
The following is an overview of the key financial measures discussed in our results of operations:
•Restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales at our restaurants, net of sales discounts and excluding sales tax collected. Restaurant sales are influenced by changes in comparable restaurant sales, menu price increases, new restaurant development, acquisition of restaurants and the closures of restaurants. Comparable restaurant sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales for a comparable restaurant base. Restaurants we acquire are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been owned for 12 months and immediately after they re-open following a remodel. Newly developed restaurants are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been open for 15 months. For comparative purposes, where applicable, the calculation of the changes in comparable restaurant sales is based either on a 53-week or 52-week year.
•Other revenue consists of fuel sales, food sales and sales of other convenience merchandise and services from the six convenience stores acquired as part of the Cambridge Acquisition (as defined in this MD&A). The six convenience stores were closed in the fourth quarter of 2019.
•Cost of sales consists of food, paper and beverage costs (including packaging costs) and delivery charges, less purchase discounts and vendor rebates. Cost of sales is generally influenced by changes in commodity costs, the mix of items sold, the level of promotional discounting, the effectiveness of our restaurant-level controls to manage food and paper costs and the relative contribution of delivery sales. In 2019, cost of sales also included fuel costs for the six convenience stores acquired as part of the Cambridge Acquisition, which contributed lower margins relative to our restaurant cost of sales.
•Restaurant wages and related expenses include all restaurant management and hourly productive labor costs and related benefits, employer payroll taxes and restaurant-level bonuses. Payroll and related benefits are subject to inflation, including minimum wage increases and increased costs for health insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and federal and state unemployment insurance.
•Restaurant rent expense includes base rent and variable rent on our leases characterized as operating leases. In 2018, restaurant rent expense also included the amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and was reduced by the amortization of deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions.
•Other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are royalty expenses paid to BKC and PLK, utilities, repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and credit card fees.
•Advertising expense includes advertising payments to BKC and PLK based on a percentage of sales as required under our franchise and operating agreements and additional marketing and promotional expenses in certain of our markets.
•General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants, legal, auditing and other professional fees, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation expense.
•EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges, acquisition and integration costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock compensation expense, other income or expense, abandoned site development costs, pre-opening expenses and certain other non-recurring expenses. Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA represents income (loss) from operations adjusted to exclude general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges and other income or expense. Adjusted net income (loss) represents net income (loss) adjusted to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, pre-opening and litigation costs, legal settlement gains and other income and expense and the related income tax effect of these adjustments.
•We are presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (loss) because we believe that they provide a more meaningful comparison than EBITDA and net income of our core business operating results, as well as with those of other similar companies. Additionally, we present Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses and other income or expense, which are not directly related to restaurant-level operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA, when viewed with our results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations on page 54, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies. For the reconciliation between net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and the reconciliation of income from operations to Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA, see page 54.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) have important limitations as analytical tools. These limitations include the following:
•EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment;
•EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service principal or interest payments on our debt;
•Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements; and
•EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that our management does not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. However, some of these charges (such as impairment, other lease charges, acquisition costs and litigation costs) have recurred and may reoccur.
•Depreciation and amortization primarily includes the depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment, owned buildings and leasehold improvements utilized in our restaurants, the amortization of franchise rights from our acquisitions of restaurants and the amortization of franchise fees paid to BKC and PLK.
•Impairment and other lease charges are determined through our assessment of the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of these assets can be recovered over their respective remaining lives through undiscounted future operating cash flows. A potential impairment charge is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Lease charges are recorded for our obligations under the related leases for closed locations net of estimated sublease recoveries.
•Interest expense consists of interest expense associated with our $425.0 million Term Loan B borrowings and $75.0 million Term Loan B-1 borrowings, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of original issue discount, interest on revolving credit borrowings, ticking fees, payments required under our interest rate swap arrangement, and, through April 30, 2019, interest on the $275.0 million of 8% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (the "8% Notes") and unamortized bond premium.
Recent and Future Events Affecting our Results of Operations
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on restaurant sales at our Burger King restaurants began during the week ended March 15, 2020. During the week ended March 29, 2020, comparable restaurant sales decreased 33.8% compared to the prior year week. Comparable restaurant sales declines at our Burger King restaurants began easing mid-April, and for the month of June the change in comparable restaurant sales was positive. For our Popeyes restaurants, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on restaurant sales started during the week ended March 22, 2020, and began easing mid-April.
In response to the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business operations and the continuing uncertainty in the economy in general, we have taken steps to adapt our business and strengthen and preserve our liquidity, including the following:
•In March 2020, we closed the dining rooms in all our restaurants and modified operating hours in line with local ordinances and day-part sales trends. These closures were in effect for most of the second quarter of 2020, with each restaurant operating according to their respective local governmental guidelines as well as safety procedures developed by BKC and PLK. As individual states and local governments have allowed reopenings, we have continually evaluated the opportunity to re-open dining rooms. By the end of the year, approximately 35% of dining rooms have reopened, however, in most cases, guests have continued to rely on our drive-thru, carry-out and delivery service modes. Restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 included approximately 1% of eat-in traffic at our Burger King restaurants and 7% of eat-in traffic at our Popeyes restaurants, which are the highest we've seen since the onset of the pandemic.
•We launched delivery services in March of 2020 at approximately 800 of our restaurants and have added additional third-party delivery partners as well as restaurant coverage over the course of the year. For the fourth quarter of 2020, delivery comprised approximately 3.5% of total restaurant sales and for all of 2020 delivery was approximately 2.4% of all sales.
•We temporarily closed 46 restaurants in late March 2020 and early April 2020 that were geographically close to one of our other restaurants, and these closures were in effect for most of the second quarter of 2020. By the end of 2020, we had reopened all of these restaurants with the exception of two Burger King restaurants we permanently closed in the third quarter.
•As discussed below, we increased revolving credit borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) by $30.8 million to a total of $145.8 million and borrowed Incremental Term B-1 Loans (as defined below) for net proceeds of $71.3 million after original issue discount to increase our liquidity and protect against the uncertainty of a prolonged pandemic.
•We remain committed to active management of our expenditures and for the second quarter of 2020 limited spending mainly to necessary restaurant maintenance issues. For the full year, we reduced operating capital expenditures to $56.9 million from $134.9 million in 2019.
•We reduced regional and corporate overhead by streamlining our regional management and support structure, improving our training process and instituted a 10% temporary reduction in all non-restaurant wages for the second quarter of 2020. Given our improved business trajectory, this reduction in wages was restored as of July 1, 2020.
•As allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, as amended (the "CARES Act"), we deferred payment of the employer portion of Social Security taxes through the end of 2020. The amount of the cumulative deferral at the end of 2020 was approximately $21.6 million, of which 50% is payable on each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.
•We negotiated with our landlords other than BKC to secure $5.8 million in deferral or abatement of 2020 cash rent obligations, of which $4.8 million was or is expected to be repaid over various periods beginning in the third quarter of 2020. We repaid $1.6 million related to these deferrals by the end of 2020.
•During the second quarter of 2020, we optimized payment terms with our key vendors and suppliers and utilized deferral opportunities with our utility vendors. These reverted to normal payment terms in July of 2020. During the year, we experienced a number of minor and/or temporary supply chain issues. All such issues have been resolved.
•We suspended any acquisition activity and share repurchases during the first quarter, which we subsequently reinstated during the fourth quarter.
Throughout the course of this evolving COVID-19 outbreak, we have been adapting our business in order to continue operating safely. To support the health and safety of our employees, beginning in March 2020 we mandated, among other things, the use of masks, sanitizers and temperature checks at the beginning of each shift for our team members as well as instituted contactless procedures in our restaurants. We also suspended all non-essential travel for our employees and implemented a work-from-home policy for all non-restaurant personnel effective through the second quarter of 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, administrative employees returned to the office on a voluntary basis in compliance with New York's phased re-opening.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the Company's customer traffic, the immediate actions taken to continue drive-thru and carry-out business operations and secure additional liquidity have minimized the financial impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We believe our business model and world-class brands are ideally positioned to serve value and convenience-seeking customers through our drive-thru, at-the-counter for take-out, and delivery channels.
While significant uncertainty remains as to when or the manner in which the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic will change, including but not limited to stock price volatility, lower customer traffic, governmental restrictions on restaurant businesses and the unpredictable economic environment, we have been nimble in adapting our operations to the realities of the marketplace and saw the results of these efforts in 2020. In 2020, we were able to increase our full year Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by $25.4 million and $21.5 million, respectively, by managing food costs, optimizing labor hours despite higher wage rates, and controlling other restaurant-level and corporate overhead expenses.
Cambridge Acquisition
On April 30, 2019, we completed a merger with New CFH, LLC, a former subsidiary of Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC ("Cambridge") and acquired 165 Burger King® restaurants, 55 Popeyes® restaurants and six convenience stores (the "Cambridge Acquisition"). Cambridge received a total of approximately 14.9 million shares of our common stock after conversion of all preferred stock initially issued to Cambridge in the Cambridge Acquisition. All shares of common stock issued to Cambridge are subject to a two year restriction on sale or transfer, subject to certain limited exceptions.
Area Development and Remodeling Agreement
The Company, Carrols, Carrols LLC, and BKC entered into a new Area Development Agreement (the "ADA") which commenced on April 30, 2019 and was set to end on September 30, 2024 and which superseded the Operating Agreement dated as of May 30, 2012, as amended, between Carrols LLC and BKC. The ADA was amended and restated by all parties on January 4, 2021 (the "Amended ADA").
Under the ADA, Carrols LLC had agreed to open, build and operate a total of 200 new Burger King restaurants including 32 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2020, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 40 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023 and 39 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the ADA. Carrols LLC also had agreed under the ADA to remodel or upgrade a total of 748 Burger King restaurants to BKC’s Burger King of Tomorrow restaurant image, including 130 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2020, 118 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 131 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 138 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023 and 141 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the ADA.
These development commitments were substantially reduced in the Amended ADA. Pursuant to the Amended ADA, Carrols LLC agreed to open, build and operate a total of 50 new Burger King restaurants, 80% of which must be in Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana. This includes four Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 10 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 12 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023, 12 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024 and 12 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2025.
In addition, pursuant to the Amended ADA, BKC granted Carrols LLC franchise pre-approval to build new Burger King restaurants or acquire Burger King restaurants from Burger King franchisees with respect to 500 Burger King restaurants in the aggregate in (i) Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana (excluding certain geographic areas in Indiana) and (ii) (a) 16 states, which include Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia (subject to certain exceptions for certain limited geographic areas within certain states) and (b) any other geographic locations that Carrols LLC enters after the commencement date of the Amended ADA pursuant to BKC procedures subject to certain limitations.
Pursuant to the ADA and for a cost of $3.0 million, BKC had assigned to Carrols LLC the right of first refusal on the sale of franchisee-operated restaurants in 16 states and a limited number of counties in four additional states, and granted franchise pre-approval to acquire Burger King restaurants until the date that we have acquired more than an aggregate of an additional 500 Burger King restaurants excluding those restaurants we acquired in the
Cambridge Acquisition ("ADA ROFR"). The ADA ROFR was terminated in connection with the Amended ADA and an impairment charge of $2.0 million for the unamortized value remaining from the payment for the ADA ROFR was recorded in 2020.
BKC agreed to contribute $10 million to $12 million for upgrades of approximately 50 to 60 Burger King restaurants in 2019 and 2020, most of which have already been remodeled to the 20/20 image and where BKC is the landlord on the lease for such Burger King restaurants operated by Carrols LLC or an affiliate. In 2019, we received $10.0 million from BKC under this arrangement.
On October 1 of each year following the commencement date of the ADA, Carrols LLC was required to pay BKC pre-paid franchise fees in the following amounts to be applied to new Burger King restaurants opened and operated by Carrols LLC: (a) $350,000 on the commencement date of the ADA, (b) $1,600,000 on October 1, 2019, (c) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2020, (d) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2021, (e) $2,000,000 on October 1, 2022 and (f) $1,950,000 on October 1, 2023. The Amended ADA eliminated the requirement for any prepayments due and payable on and after October 1, 2020, and the $0.6 million balance of prepaid franchise fees paid under the ADA that had not yet been applied to new restaurant development was forfeited.
Through the Cambridge Acquisition, we have also assumed a development agreement for Popeyes®, which includes an assignment by PLK of its right of first refusal under its franchise agreements with its franchisees for acquisitions in two southern states, as well as a development commitment to open, build and operate approximately 80 new Popeyes® restaurants over six years.
Restaurant Acquisitions
From the beginning of 2018 through January 3, 2021, we acquired 278 restaurants from other Burger King and Popeyes franchisees in the following transactions ($ in thousands):
(1)We recorded a bargain purchase gain because the fair value of assets acquired, largely representing a franchise right asset of $0.3 million, exceeded the total fair value of consideration paid by $0.2 million.
(2)Acquisitions resulting from the exercise of our right of first refusal on acquisitions in certain markets.
(3)The Cambridge Acquisition included 165 Burger King restaurants and 55 Popeyes restaurants.
The 2019 acquired restaurants included 14 fee-owned properties, of which six were subsequently sold in sale-leaseback transactions in 2019 for net proceeds of $8.3 million and two were subsequently sold in sale leaseback transactions in 2020 for net proceeds of $3.4 million. All of the 2018 acquired restaurants were leased properties.
The pro forma impact on the results of operations for the 2019 acquired restaurants is included below. The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of any future consolidated operating results. This pro forma financial information does not give effect to any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings or any transaction costs related to the 2019 acquired restaurants. The following table summarizes certain pro forma financial information related to our 2019 operating results (in thousands):
Capital Expenditures
We expect that our capital expenditures in 2021 will be approximately $65 million to $75 million, which includes approximately 35% for remodeling existing restaurants, 25% for the construction of eight new restaurants, and 20% for required ongoing capital maintenance expenditures.
In 2021, proceeds from sale/leaseback transactions related to new restaurant development are expected to be approximately $8 million to $13 million. We will review on an ongoing basis our future development and remodel plans in relation to our available capital resources.
Refinancing of Indebtedness and our Senior Credit Facilities
On April 30, 2019, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility which provides for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million (the "Senior Credit Facilities"), consisting of (i) a term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million (the “Term Loan B Facility”), the entire amount of which was borrowed by us on April 30, 2019 and (ii) a revolving credit facility (including a sub-facility of $35.0 million for standby letters of credit) in an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). Borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of (i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin of 2.25% or (ii) the LIBOR Rate plus a margin of 3.25% (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). The Term Loan B Facility matures on April 30, 2026 and the Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 30, 2024.
On December 13, 2019, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement which amended a financial covenant under the Senior Credit Facilities applicable solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility that previously required the Company to maintain quarterly a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) of not greater than 4.75 to 1.00 (measured on a most recent four quarter basis), to now require that the Company maintain only a First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) of not greater than 5.75 to 1.00 (as measured on a most recent four quarter basis) if, and only if, on the last day of any fiscal quarter (beginning with the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2019), the sum of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding revolving credit borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the aggregate face amount of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an aggregate face amount up to $12.0 million) exceeds 35% of the aggregate amount of the maximum revolving credit borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The First Amendment also reduced the aggregate maximum revolving credit borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility by $10.0 million to a total of $115.0 million.
As of December 29, 2019, there were $45.8 million of revolving credit borrowings outstanding and $11.6 million of letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. After reserving for issued letters of credit and outstanding revolving credit borrowings, $57.6 million was available for revolving credit borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities at December 29, 2019.
On March 25, 2020, we entered into the Second Amendment to our Senior Credit Facilities (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment increased the aggregate maximum commitments available for revolving credit borrowings (including standby letters of credit) under the revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Committed Amount") by $15.4 million to a total of $130.4 million.
The Second Amendment also amended the definition of Applicable Margin (such definition and all other definitions used herein and otherwise not defined herein shall be the meanings set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities) in the Credit Agreement to provide that on and after the date of the Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment Effective Date"), the Applicable Margin for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (including Letter of Credit Fees) shall be at a rate per annum equal to (a) for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is greater than $115.0 million, (i) for the period commencing on the Second Amendment Effective Date and including the date that is 179 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, 3.5% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 2.5% for Alternate Base Rate Loans, (ii) for the period commencing on the date that is 180 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, through and including the date that is 269 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, 4.25% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 3.25% for Alternate Base Rate Loans, (iii) for the period commencing on the date that is 270 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, through and including the date that is 364 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, 4.5% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 3.5% for Alternate Base Rate Loans and (iv) for the period commencing on the date that is 365 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date and thereafter, 4.75% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 3.75% for Alternate Base Rate Loans and (b) for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is equal to or less than $115.0 million, 3.5% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 2.5% for Alternate Base Rate Loans.
The Second Amendment provides that beginning on the 180th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date and for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is greater than $115.0 million, we shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Facility Lenders, a commitment fee (the "Ticking Fee") on the average daily amount of the Revolving Committed Amount at a rate per annum equal to (a) 0.125% for the 180th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date through and including the 269th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date, (b) 0.25% for the 270th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date through and including the 364th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date and (c) 1.00% for the 365th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date and thereafter. The Second Amendment provides that the Ticking Fee will be due and payable quarterly in arrears (calculated on a 360-day basis) on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and will accrue from the 180th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is greater than $115.0 million. We recorded expense of $0.1 million related to these ticking fees in the year ended January 3, 2021.
The Second Amendment further provides that we shall use the proceeds of an Extension of Credit which results in the sum of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the aggregate amount of LOC Obligations equaling an amount in excess of $115.0 million, solely for our ongoing operations and our subsidiaries and shall not be held as cash on the balance sheet. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, (the "Letter Agreement") dated as of March 25, 2020 among the Company, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Truist Bank, we agreed to defer rent payments totaling approximately $2.4 million per month under certain real property leases for the period between April 1, 2020 through and including June 30, 2020. We paid these amounts in full according to these terms on July 1, 2020.
On April 8, 2020, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Senior Credit Facilities which increased the aggregate maximum commitments available for revolving credit borrowings (including standby letters of credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility by $15.4 million to a total of $145.8 million.
On April 16, 2020, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to our Senior Credit Facilities (the "Fourth Amendment"). The Fourth Amendment permits us to incur and, if necessary, repay indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the "PPP") under the CARES Act. Subsequent to this amendment, we withdrew our application for relief under the PPP and returned the funds upon receipt.
On June 23, 2020 (the "Fifth Amendment Effective Date"), we entered into the Fifth Amendment to our Senior Credit Facilities (the "Fifth Amendment"). The Fifth Amendment increased the Term Loan (as defined in the
Senior Credit Facilities) borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of $75 million of Incremental Term B-1 Loans (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). The Incremental Term B-1 Loans constitute a new tranche of Term Loans ranking pari passu in right of payment and security with the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) for all purposes under the Senior Credit Facilities. The Incremental Term B-1 Loans have the same terms as outstanding borrowings under the Company's existing term loan B facility pursuant to and in accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities, provided that (i) borrowings under the Incremental Term B-1 Loans will bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of (a) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) plus the applicable margin of 5.25% or (b) the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) (which shall not be less than 1% for Incremental Term B-1 Loans) plus the applicable margin of 6.25% and (ii) certain prepayments of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans by us prior to the first anniversary of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date are subject to a premium to the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities), for the ratable account of each applicable Term Loan Lender (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) holding Incremental Term B-1 Loans on the date of such prepayment equal to the Applicable Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) with respect to the principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans so prepaid. The principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans will amortize in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans and shall be repayable in consecutive quarterly installments on the last day of our fiscal quarters beginning on the third fiscal quarter of 2020 with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loan and all accrued but unpaid interest and other amounts payable with respect to the Incremental Term B-1 Loan due on April 30, 2026 which is the Term Loan Maturity Date (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities).
As of January 3, 2021, there were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding and $9.7 million of letters of credit were issued under our Revolving Credit Facility. After reserving for issued letters of credit, $136.1 million was available for revolving credit borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities at January 3, 2021.
Interest Rate Swap Agreement
We entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement commencing March 3, 2020 and ending February 28, 2025 with a notional amount of $220.0 million to swap variable rate interest payments (one-month LIBOR plus the applicable margin) under our Senior Credit Facilities for fixed interest payments bearing an interest rate of 0.915% plus the applicable margin in our Senior Credit Facilities.
Stock Repurchase Program
On August 2, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan (the "Repurchase Program") under which we may repurchase up to $25 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization became effective August 2, 2019, and will expire 24 months thereafter, unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors. Purchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions (including, without limitation, the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans) in compliance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
During the year ended January 3, 2021, we repurchased 1,534,304 shares in open market transactions of our common stock at an average share price of $6.52 for a total cost of $10.0 million under the Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 29, 2019, we repurchased 553,112 shares in open market transactions at an average share price of $7.26 for a total cost of $4.0 million under the Repurchase Program.
We have no obligation to repurchase additional shares of stock under the Repurchase Program, and the timing, actual number and value of shares purchased will depend on our stock price, trading volume, general market and economic conditions and other factors.
Future Restaurant Closures
We evaluate the performance of our restaurants on an ongoing basis including an assessment of the current and future operating results of each restaurant in relation to its cash flow and future occupancy costs and, with
regard to franchise agreement renewals, the cost of required capital improvements. We may elect to close restaurants based on these evaluations.
In 2020, excluding one restaurant relocated within its trade area, we closed 33 restaurants. We currently anticipate less than five restaurant closures in 2021 outside of any restaurants being relocated within their trade area at the end of their respective lease term.
Our determination of whether to close restaurants in the future is subject to further evaluation and may change. We may incur lease charges in the future from closures of underperforming restaurants prior to the expiration of their contractual lease term. We do not believe that the future impact on our results of operations due to restaurant closures will be material, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
Effect of Minimum Wage Increases
Certain of the states and municipalities in which we operate have increased their minimum wage rates for 2020 and in many cases have also approved additional increases for future periods. Most notably, New York State has increased the minimum wage applicable to our business to $13.75 an hour in 2020 from $12.75 per hour in 2019 and $11.75 per hour in 2018, with subsequent annual increases reaching $15.00 per hour by July 1, 2021. New York State has an Urban Youth Credit through 2022 from which we have been receiving approximately $500,000 per year since 2016. We had 125 restaurants in New York State as of January 3, 2021. We also have one restaurant in Massachusetts that has annual minimum wage increases reaching $15.00 per hour in 2023, 10 restaurants in New Jersey that have annual minimum wage increases reaching $15.00 per hour in 2024, and 45 total restaurants in Illinois and Maryland that also have annual minimum wage increases reaching $15.00 per hour in 2025. We typically attempt to offset the effects of wage inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset these wage increases in the future.
Results of Operations
Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019
The following table highlights the key components of sales and the number of restaurants in operation for the years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1) New restaurants opened in 2020 and 2019 included one and two restaurants, respectively, that were closed and relocated within their market areas.
Restaurant Sales and Other Revenue. Total restaurant sales in 2020 increased 6.5% to $1,547.5 million from $1,452.5 million in 2019. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 2.7% due to an increase in average check of 13.1% which was more than offset by a decrease in customer traffic of 13.9%. The comparable restaurant sales decline includes the significant sales declines we experienced in March (-16.8%) and April (-21.7%) of 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of menu price increases in 2020 was approximately 1.6%.
Restaurant sales overall increased $95.0 million, which included $28.4 million from the impact of a 53rd week in fiscal 2020 and $95.7 million from including a full year of operations for the 200 restaurants acquired in 2019 as compared with eight months of operations in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we had other revenue of $10.2 million from six convenience stores acquired in the Cambridge Acquisition that are not included in restaurant sales above. These stores were closed at the end of 2019.
Operating Costs and Expenses (percentages stated as a percentage of total restaurant sales unless otherwise noted).
The following table sets forth selected operating results for the years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:
Cost of sales decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales to 29.3% in 2020 from 29.7% in 2019. This decrease reflected the positive impacts of improved operational efficiencies at our Burger King restaurants (0.8%), menu price increases taken since the end of 2019 at our Burger King restaurants (0.5%), and the inclusion of convenience stores in the prior year which had a higher cost of sales (0.6%). These positive impacts were offset by increased commodity costs at our Burger King restaurants (1.1%, including a 3.2% increase in ground beef prices compared to 2019) and the inclusion of delivery costs in 2020 (0.4%). The impact of higher promotional discounting during 2020 was offset by a favorable sales mix.
Cost of sales at our Popeyes restaurants improved approximately 160 basis points over last year due to improved operations at those restaurants (0.1%). Cost of sales in the prior year related to the convenience stores we closed in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $9.2 million, or 0.6% of revenue in 2020.
Restaurant wages and related expenses decreased to 32.2% in 2020 from 33.4% in 2019 due to labor adjustments we made during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to adjust our labor requirements and hours based on operating day part sales trends and in response to dining room closures. The impact of hourly labor rate increases in 2020, inclusive of minimum wage increases, was 5.6% at our legacy restaurants when compared to the prior year period. This was more than offset through effective labor hour management in 2020.
Restaurant rent expense increased to 7.7% in 2020 from 7.4% in 2019 due to the sale-leaseback of 36 restaurant locations from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the end of 2020 which either previously did not incur rent costs or resulted in higher rent on the property.
Other restaurant operating expenses decreased to 15.3% in 2020 from 15.7% in 2019 due primarily to lower repair and maintenance costs (0.2%) and lower utility costs (0.2%).
Advertising expense decreased to 3.9% in 2020 from 4.0% in 2019 due to advertising incentives received for certain remodeled Burger King restaurants.
Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA. As a result of the factors above, as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 of $6.3 million, Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA increased $25.4 million to $181.6 million in 2020 from $156.1 million in 2019. For a reconciliation between Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA and income from operations see page 54.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $84.1 million in 2020 from $84.7 million in 2019. We reduced regional and corporate overhead in 2020 by streamlining our regional management structure and making improvements to our training process, which offset the impact of increased overhead from the Cambridge Acquisition, as well as reducing travel by $1.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. We instituted a 10% temporary reduction in non-restaurant wages for the second quarter of 2020, which reduced general
and administrative expenses by $1.0 million. This 10% temporary reduction in non-restaurant wages was restored as of July 1, 2020. The full impact of these administrative cost reductions was offset by $3.4 million higher administrative bonus accruals in 2020 as a result of favorable profitability in the period.
We incurred $1.4 million and $0.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, in administrative costs pertaining to non-recurring litigation and professional fees. In connection with our pause on new development in 2020, we recorded $3.5 million in expense for abandoned site development costs, including $0.6 million related to forfeiting prepaid franchise fees in connection with the Amended ADA. Administrative expenses in 2019 included $8.2 million more of acquisition and integration costs. General and administrative expenses excluding the non-recurring costs described above decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 5.1% in 2020 from 5.2% in 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA. As a result of the factors above, as well as an impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 of $5.3 million, Adjusted EBITDA increased $21.5 million to $107.9 million in 2020 from $86.4 million in 2019.
For a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA see page 54.
Depreciation and Amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense to $81.7 million in 2020 from $74.7 million in 2019 was primarily due to our acquisitions of restaurants in 2019 being included for a full year in 2020.
Impairment and Other Lease Charges. We recorded impairment and other lease charges of $12.8 million in 2020 consisting of $2.0 million related to the impairment of the remaining unamortized value of our right of first refusal under our ADA with BKC, $5.0 million related to initial impairment charges for fifteen underperforming restaurants, $1.2 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, and other lease charges of $4.6 million primarily related to the closure of 23 of our underperforming restaurant locations during 2020.
We recorded impairment and other lease charges of $3.6 million in 2019 and included $0.3 million of capital expenditures at previously impaired restaurants, $1.3 million related to initial impairment charges for seven underperforming restaurants, and other lease charges of $1.9 million mostly related to the closing of the six convenience stores acquired in 2019 from Cambridge.
Other Income, Net. In 2020, we recorded other income, net, of $1.3 million which consisted of gains related to insurance recoveries from property damage at four of our restaurants of $2.1 million, a net gain on 12 sale-leaseback transactions of $0.2 million and a loss on disposal of assets of $1.0 million.
In 2019, we recorded other income, net, of $1.9 million, which consisted of a $1.9 million gain from a settlement with BKC for their approval of new restaurant development by other franchisees which unfavorably impacted our restaurants, a $0.6 million net gain on sale-leaseback transactions, a $0.2 million gain related to insurance recoveries from fire at two of our restaurants and a loss on a disposal of restaurant equipment of $0.8 million.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $27.3 million in 2020 from $27.9 million in 2019. The weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt, excluding lease financing obligations, was 4.6% in 2020 and 6.1% in 2019.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $7.4 million in 2019 in connection with the refinancing of the 8% Notes. The loss consisted of the write-off of unamortized debt costs, unamortized bond premium and additional redemption fees.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. In 2020, we recorded income tax expense of $6.3 million and our effective income tax rate was 27.2%. The difference to the Federal statutory rate for 2020 of 21% is primarily due to a charge in the period of $13.1 million to establish an incremental tax valuation allowance for certain income tax credits as they may expire prior to utilization, the tax benefit of state income taxes, and other discrete tax items.
The benefit for income taxes in 2019 of $12.1 million was at an effective tax rate of 27.5%, including discrete tax expense items of $0.5 million. The difference compared to the Federal statutory rate for 2019 of 21% is
primarily due to the tax benefit of employment tax credits which are not directly related to the amount of pre-tax loss and the tax benefit of state income taxes.
Net Income (Loss). As a result of the above, our net loss was $29.5 million in 2020, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $31.9 million in 2019, or $0.74 per diluted share.
Reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) and income (loss) from operations to Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA for the years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 are as follows (in thousands):
(1)Acquisition and integration costs for twelve months ended January 3, 2021 primarily include legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of 165 Burger King and 55 Popeyes restaurants from Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC in 2019, which were included in general and administrative expense. Acquisition and integration costs for the twelve months ended December 29, 2019 of $10.8 million include certain legal and professional fees; corporate payroll, and other costs related to the integration of the Cambridge merger and one-time repair costs which are included in Adjusted Restaurant-Level EBITDA.
(2)Abandoned development costs for the twelve months ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 represent the write-off of capitalized costs due to the abandoned development of future restaurant locations.
(3)Pre-opening costs for the twelve months ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 include training, labor and occupancy costs incurred during the construction of new restaurants.
(4)Litigation and other professional expenses for the twelve months ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 include costs pertaining to an ongoing lawsuit with one of the Company's former vendors, costs to settle a class action claim and other non-recurring professional service expenses.
(5)Other income, net for the twelve months ended January 3, 2021 included gains related to insurance recoveries from property damage at four of the Company's restaurants of $2.1 million, a net gain on 12 sale-leaseback transactions of $0.2 million and a loss on disposal of assets of $1.0 million.
(6)Other income, net for the twelve months ended December 29, 2019 included a $1.9 million gain related to a settlement with Burger King Corporation for the approval of new restaurant development by other franchisees which unfavorably impacted the Company's restaurants, net gains on sale-leaseback transactions of $0.6 million, a gain related to an insurance recovery from property damage at two of the Company's restaurants of $0.2 million and a loss on a disposal of restaurant equipment of $0.8 million.
(7)The income tax effect related to the adjustments to Adjusted Net Loss during the periods presented was calculated using an incremental income tax rate of 25.0% for the three and twelve months ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively.
(8)Reflects the removal of the income tax provision recorded during the year ended January 3, 2021 for the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain federal income tax credits as they may expire prior to their utilization by the Company.
(9)Adjusted diluted net loss per share is calculated based on Adjusted net loss and the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective periods, where applicable.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As is common in the restaurant industry, we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and receive trade credit based upon negotiated terms for purchasing food products and other supplies. As a result, we may at times maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets, which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because:
•restaurant operations are primarily conducted on a cash basis;
•rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories; and
•cash from sales is usually received before related liabilities for food, supplies and payroll become due.
Interest payments under our debt obligations, capital expenditures including for our remodeling initiatives, payments of royalties and advertising to BKC and Popeyes and payments related to our lease obligations represent significant liquidity requirements for us, not including any discretionary expenditures for the acquisition or development of additional Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. We believe our cash balances, cash generated from our operations and availability of revolving credit borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months.
Operating activities. Net cash provided from operating activities for the years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 was $103.9 million and $48.7 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 increased by $55.2 million compared to 2019 due primarily to an increase of Adjusted EBITDA of $21.5 million and a change in working capital of $19.0 million, primarily related to our deferral of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020 of $21.6 million.
Net cash provided from operating activities in 2019 decreased by $32.1 million compared to 2018 due primarily to a reduction of Adjusted EBITDA of $16.6 million, an increase in deferred income tax liabilities of $11.5 million and a change in operating right-of use assets and operating lease liabilities of $4.0 million.
Investing activities. Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 was $47.9 million and $218.0 million, respectively. In 2020, in addition to our capital expenditures of $56.9 million, we received net proceeds of $7.0 million from sale-leaseback transactions, including properties purchased for sale-leaseback, and received $2.1 million from property insurance recoveries.
In 2019, in addition to our capital expenditures of $134.9 million, we completed the Cambridge Acquisition which included approximately $113.8 million for retirement of the Cambridge indebtedness net of cash, acquired fourteen Burger King restaurants from other franchisees for $16.9 million, and received net proceeds of $47.2 million from sale-leaseback transactions, including properties purchased for sale-leaseback.
Capital expenditures are a large component of our investing activities and include: (1) new restaurant development, which may include the purchase of real estate; (2) restaurant remodeling, which includes the renovation or rebuilding of the interior and exterior of our existing restaurants including expenses associated with our franchise agreement renewals and certain restaurants that we acquire; (3) other restaurant capital expenditures, which include capital maintenance expenditures for the ongoing reinvestment and enhancement of our restaurants, and from time to time, to support BKC’s initiatives; and (4) corporate and restaurant information systems, including expenditures for our point-of-sale software for restaurants that we acquire.
The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands):
Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $5.9 million and included $71.3 million in net proceeds from issuance of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans, net repayments of our revolving credit borrowings of $45.8 million, and purchases of treasury shares of $10.1 million. We also incurred $3.3 million of costs associated with the financing long-term debt, made principal payments on term loan facilities of $4.6 million, made principal payments on finance leases of $1.6 million, and repurchased shares of our common stock for $10.0 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was $168.3 million, due primarily to proceeds from the Term Loan B Facility of $422.9 million combined with net revolving credit borrowings of $45.8 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and the redemption of the 8.0% Notes including premium and fees of $280.5 million. We also incurred $11.5 million of costs associated with the Senior Credit Facilities, made principal payments on finance leases of $2.2 million, and repurchased shares of our common stock for $4.0 million.
Senior Credit Facilities. On April 30, 2019, we entered into the Senior Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million, consisting of (i) a Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million maturing on April 30, 2026 and (ii) a Revolving Credit Facility (including a sub-facility of $35.0 million for standby letters of credit) in an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million maturing on April 30, 2024.
The net proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility were $422.9 million after original issue discount and were used to (i) refinance the indebtedness of Carrols Restaurant Group, including redemption of $275.0 million of 8.0% Notes and accrued interest thereon at a redemption price of 102%, (ii) the retirement of outstanding Cambridge indebtedness and (iii) the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the Cambridge Acquisition and the Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility will finance ongoing working capital and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions and required expenditures under development agreements. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss of $7.4 million on the extinguishment of debt.
On December 13, 2019, we entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement which amended a financial covenant under the Senior Credit Facilities applicable solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility that previously required the Company to maintain quarterly a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) of not greater than 4.75 to 1.00 (measured on a most recent four quarter basis), to now require that the Company maintain only a First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) of not greater than 5.75 to 1.00 (as measured on a most recent four quarter basis) if, and only if, on the last day of any fiscal quarter (beginning with the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2019), the sum of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding revolving credit borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the aggregate face amount of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an aggregate face amount up to $12.0 million) exceeds 35% of the aggregate amount of the maximum revolving credit borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The First Amendment also reduced the aggregate maximum revolving credit borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility by $10.0 million to a total of $115.0 million.
On March 25, 2020, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to its Senior Credit Facilities (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment increased the aggregate maximum commitments available for revolving credit borrowings (including standby letters of credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolving Committed Amount") by $15.4 million to a total of $130.4 million.
The Second Amendment also amended the definition of Applicable Margin (such definition and all other definitions used herein and otherwise not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities) to provide that on and after the date of the Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment Effective Date"), the Applicable Margin for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (including Letter of Credit Fees) shall be at a rate per annum equal to (a) for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is greater than $115.0 million, (i) for the period commencing on the Second Amendment Effective Date and including the date that is 179 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, 3.5% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 2.5% for Alternate Base Rate Loans, (ii) for the period commencing on the date that is 180 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, through and including the date that is 269 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, 4.25% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 3.25% for Alternate Base Rate Loans, (iii) for the period commencing on the date that is 270 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, through and including the date that is 364 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date, 4.5% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 3.5% for Alternate Base Rate Loans and (iv) for the period commencing on the date that is 365 days after the Second Amendment Effective Date and thereafter, 4.75% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 3.75% for Alternate Base Rate Loans and (b) for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is equal to or less than $115.0 million, 3.5% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 2.5% for Alternate Base Rate Loans.
The Second Amendment also provides that beginning on the 180th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date and for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is greater than $115.0 million, the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Facility Lenders, a commitment fee (the "Ticking Fee") on the average daily amount of the Revolving Committed Amount at a rate per annum equal to (a) 0.125% for the 180th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date through and including the 269th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date, (b) 0.25% for the 270th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date through and including the 364th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date and (c) 1.00% for the 365th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date and thereafter. The Second Amendment provides that the Ticking Fee will be due and payable quarterly in arrears (calculated on a 360-day basis) on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and will accrue from the 180th day after the Second Amendment Effective Date for so long as the Revolving Committed Amount is greater than $115.0 million. The Second Amendment also provides that the Company shall use the proceeds of an Extension of Credit which results in the sum of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the aggregate amount of LOC Obligations equaling an amount in excess of $115.0 million, solely for ongoing operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and shall not be held as cash on the balance sheet. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement dated as of March 25, 2020 among the Company, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Truist Bank, the Company agreed to defer rent payments totaling approximately $2.4 million per month under certain real property leases for the period between April 1, 2020 through and including June 30, 2020. The Company paid these amounts in full according to these terms on July 1, 2020.
On April 8, 2020, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to its Senior Credit Facilities which increased the aggregate maximum commitments available for revolving credit borrowings (including standby letters of credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility by $15.4 million to a total of $145.8 million.
On April 16, 2020, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to its Senior Credit Facilities (the "Fourth Amendment"). The Fourth Amendment permits the Company to incur and, if necessary, repay indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the "PPP") under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, as amended (the "CARES Act"). Subsequent to this amendment, the Company withdrew its application for relief under the PPP and returned the funds upon receipt.
On June 23, 2020 (the "Fifth Amendment Effective Date"), the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to its Senior Credit Facilities (the "Fifth Amendment"). The Fifth Amendment increased the Term Loan (as defined in
the Senior Credit Facilities) borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of $75 million of Incremental Term B-1 Loans (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). The Incremental Term B-1 Loans constitute a new tranche of Term Loans ranking pari passu in right of payment and security with the Initial Term Loans for all purposes under the Senior Credit Facilities. The Incremental Term B-1 Loans have the same terms as outstanding borrowings under the Company's existing term loan B facility pursuant to and in accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities, provided that (i) borrowings under the Incremental Term B-1 Loans will bear interest at a rate per annum, at the Company’s option, of (a) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) plus the applicable margin of 5.25% or (b) the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) (which shall not be less than 1% for Incremental Term B-1 Loans) plus the applicable margin of 6.25% and (ii) certain prepayments of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans by the Company prior to the first anniversary of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date are subject to a premium to the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities), for the ratable account of each applicable Term Loan Lender (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) holding Incremental Term B-1 Loans on the date of such prepayment equal to the Applicable Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) with respect to the principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans so prepaid. The principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans will amortize in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans and shall be repayable in consecutive quarterly installments on the last day of the Company's fiscal quarters beginning on the third fiscal quarter of 2020 with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the Incremental Term B-1 Loan and all accrued but unpaid interest and other amounts payable with respect to the Incremental Term B-1 Loan due on April 30, 2026 which is the Term Loan Maturity Date (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities).
The net proceeds of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans were $71.3 million after original issue discount and were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility.
At January 3, 2021, borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities bore interest as follows:
(i) Revolving Credit Facility: at a rate per annum equal to (a) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) plus 2.50% or (b) LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) plus 3.50%.
(ii) Term Loan B borrowings: at a rate per annum equal to (a) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) plus 2.25% or (b) LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) plus 3.25%.
(iii) Term Loan B-1 borrowings: at a rate per annum, at our option, of (a) the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin of 5.25% or (b) the LIBOR Rate (which shall not be less than 1% for Incremental Term B-1 Loans) plus the applicable margin of 6.25%.
The Term Loan B and B-1 borrowings are due and payable in quarterly installments, which began on September 30, 2019. Amounts outstanding at January 3, 2021 are due and payable as follows:
(i) twenty-one quarterly installments of $1.3 million;
(ii) one final payment of $467.0 million on April 30, 2026.
Our obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and subsidiary guarantors (including a pledge of all of the capital stock and equity interests of certain subsidiary guarantors).
Under the Senior Credit Facilities, we will be required to make mandatory prepayments of borrowings with excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities) and in the event of dispositions of assets, debt issuances and insurance and condemnation proceeds (all subject to certain exceptions).
The Senior Credit Facilities contain certain covenants, including, without limitation, those limiting the Company's and the subsidiary guarantors’ ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the character of its business in any material respects, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments, make certain restricted payments or pay dividends.
Under the Senior Credit Facilities, the lenders may terminate their obligation to advance and may declare the unpaid balance of borrowings, or any part thereof, immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of customary defaults which include, without limitation, payment default, covenant defaults,
bankruptcy type defaults, defaults on other indebtedness, judgments or upon the occurrence of a change of control (as specified therein).
As of January 3, 2021, there were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding and $9.7 million of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. After reserving for issued letters of credit and outstanding revolving credit borrowings, $136.1 million was available for revolving credit borrowings at January 3, 2021 under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with the financial covenants under our Senior Credit Facilities at January 3, 2021.
Prior Senior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2012, we entered into a senior credit facility (the "prior senior credit facility"), which was most recently amended on June 20, 2017 to increase the permitted indebtedness of our 8% Notes to a principal amount not to exceed $300.0 million in order to provide for the additional $75 million principal amount of the 8% Notes issued on June 23, 2017. Previously, on January 13, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our prior senior credit facility to, among other things, increase maximum revolving credit borrowings to $125.0 million (including $20.0 million available for letters of credit). The prior senior credit facility also provided for potential incremental borrowing increases of up to $25.0 million, in the aggregate.
Borrowings under the prior senior credit facility bore interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of:
(i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.75% based on our Adjusted Leverage Ratio, or
(ii) the LIBOR Rate plus the applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.75% based on our Adjusted Leverage Ratio (all terms as defined under the prior senior credit facility).
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 3, 2021 (in thousands):
(1)Our long term debt at January 3, 2021 included $493.3 million of Term Loan B and B-1 borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities and no borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Total interest payments on term loan borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities of $124.8 million for all years presented are included at the coupon rate of 5.74% per annum.
(2)Includes total interest of $0.1 million for all years presented.
(3)Includes total interest of $512.9 million for all years presented.
(4)Includes total interest of $0.3 million for all years presented.
We have not included obligations under our postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table as our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is funded as retiree medical claims are paid. Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers' compensation, general liability and employee healthcare claims for which we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. The majority of our recorded liabilities related to self-insured employee health and insurance plans represent estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. The total of these liabilities was $9.9 million at January 3, 2021.
Future restaurant remodeling obligations to BKC have also been excluded from the table above as well as contractual obligations related to royalties and advertising payable to BKC.
Long-Term Debt Obligations. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for details of our long-term debt.
Lease Guarantees. Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. ("Fiesta"), our former wholly-owned subsidiary, was spun-off in 2012 to our stockholders. As of January 3, 2021, we are a guarantor under 18 Fiesta restaurant property leases, of which all except for two are still operating, with lease terms expiring on various dates through 2030. We are fully liable for all obligations under the terms of the leases in the event that Fiesta fails to pay any sums due under the lease, subject to indemnification provisions of the separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin-off.
The maximum potential liability for future rental payments we could be required to make under these leases at January 3, 2021 was $13.6 million. The obligations under these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire. No payments have been made to date and none are expected to be required to be made in the future. We have not recorded a liability for those guarantees in accordance with ASC 460 - Guarantees as Fiesta has indemnified us for all such obligations and we did not believe it was probable we would be required to perform under any of the guarantees or direct obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Inflation
The inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in food and paper costs, labor and other operating expenses, the cost of providing medical and prescription drug insurance to our employees and energy costs. Wages paid in our restaurants are impacted by changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Accordingly, changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates directly affect our labor costs. We typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation, at least in part, through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in the “Significant Accounting Policies” footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
Sales recognition at our restaurants is straightforward as customers pay for products at the time of sale and inventory turns over very quickly. Payments to vendors for products sold in the restaurants are generally settled within 30 days. The earnings reporting process is covered by our system of internal controls and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments. However, critical accounting estimates and judgments, as noted below, are inherent in the assessment and recording of the fair market values of acquired restaurant assets and liabilities, insurance liabilities, assessing impairment of long-lived assets, lease accounting matters and the valuation of deferred income tax assets. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions.
Acquisition Accounting. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations" ("ASC 805"). As required by ASC 805, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their respective fair values as of the business combination date. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, favorable and unfavorable leases and intangible assets. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and, when necessary, engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of favorable or unfavorable leases and intangible assets.
Insurance Liabilities. The amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We are insured for certain losses related to
workers’ compensation, general liability and medical insurance claims under policies where we pay all claims, subject to annual stop-loss insurance limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate. We record insurance liabilities based on historical trends, which are continually monitored, and adjust accruals as warranted by changing circumstances. Since there are estimates and assumptions inherent in recording these insurance liabilities, including the ability to estimate the future development of incurred claims based on historical claims experience and loss reserves, current claim data, and the severity of the claims, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities. As of January 3, 2021, we had $9.9 million accrued for these insurance claims.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets. We assess the potential impairment of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine if there is an impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our restaurants. If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In determining future cash flows, significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term, including sales trends, labor rates, commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions which can be impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. Our fair value estimates are also subject to a high degree of judgment, including our ability to sell the related assets and changing market conditions. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary from those estimates used, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future.
Lease Accounting. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, Leases, as of December 31, 2018, coinciding with the standard’s effective date. We have operating and finance leases related to our restaurants. In accordance with ASC 842, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and long term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment and other current and long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities are calculated using the effective interest method and recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term, regardless of classification, while the amortization of ROU assets varies depending upon classification. As our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) to determine the present value of lease payments. This analysis considers qualitative and quantitative factors. We adjust our selected IBR quarterly with a company-specific yield curve that approximates our market risk profile. The collateralized IBR is also based upon the estimated impact that the collateral has on the IBR.
Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In evaluating the realizability of our net deferred tax assets, we perform an assessment of positive and negative evidence, as required by ASC 740. ASC 740 prescribes that objective historical evidence, in particular our three-year cumulative loss position at January 3, 2021, be given a greater weight than subjective evidence, including our forecast of future taxable income, which include assumptions that cannot be objectively verified. In determining the likelihood of future realization of the deferred income tax assets as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 we considered both positive and negative evidence and weighted the effect of such evidence based upon its objectivity. Based on the required weight of evidence under ASC 740, as of January 3, 2021 we determined that a valuation allowance was needed for certain income tax credits in the amount of $13.1 million as they may expire prior to their utilization. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as projections for growth. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the positive and negative evidence considered in arriving at the above conclusion, in order to assess whether such conclusion remains appropriate in future periods.
We must also make estimates of certain items that relate to current and deferred tax liabilities. These estimates include employer tax credits for items such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, as well as estimates of tax depreciation based on methods anticipated to be used on our tax returns. These estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the estimate and historical experience.
