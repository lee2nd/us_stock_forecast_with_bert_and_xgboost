Our consolidated audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, which are included herein.
Our operating results for year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:
The Company recognized revenues of $5,003 and incurred gross loss of $87,409 from the sales of minded sand from the River Sand Project during the year ended June 30, 2020. The Company did not recognize any revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019.
Our financial statements reported a net loss of $1,343,169 for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to a net loss of $1,086,052 for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our losses have increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of an increase in gross loss from the sale of river sand of $87,409, an increase in operating expenses of $147,495 and an increase in other expense of $22,213. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increases in general and administrative expenses and amortization and impairment of concession acquisition costs which included a full year of amortization during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to a partial year in the prior period along with an impairment charge of $182,383 during the year ended June 30, 2020. These increases were offset by decreases in management fees, which for the year ended June 30, 2019 were entirely compensation related and in addition to a decrease in professional fees.
Other expense increased to $194,840 for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to $172,627 for the year ended June 30, 2019. Other expense related primarily to interest expense imputed for our non-interest bearing advances from related parties. We expect interest expense to increase in future periods until such time as we are able to generate profitable operations and begin to repay our advances from our directors and entities related to our directors.
Should we be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital, obtain an export license, and are able to successfully close one or more of our outstanding offers to purchase mining and explorations rights and thus begin exploration and mining operations, we expect that our expenses to increase substantially.
Liquidity and Financial Condition
Working Capital
Our working capital deficit decreased as of June 30, 2020, as compared to June 30, 2019, primarily due to an increase in current liabilities to fund operating losses.
In the coming quarters, prior to obtaining the final permits or licenses, our largest cash outlays will be in regards to (1) professional fees for work performed for our reporting as part of Nami Corp. and (2) for the consultants as part of their work performed to respond to any additional requests received from governmental authorities as part of the process of obtaining approval for the permits and licenses. In the coming quarters we will be required to pay our consultants.
Due to the continuing losses and operating results to date, our financial statements include a statement that there is a going concern in regards to the Company. Without significant additional investment in the form of debt or equity we may have difficulty meeting our obligations as they come due prior to our obtaining all the necessary permits to begin contracting for sea sand mining permits.

Contractual Obligations
As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.
Going Concern
Our financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, our company has negative working capital, recurring losses, and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about our company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if our company is unable to continue as a going concern.
In the coming year, our company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of our business, maintaining our good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. Our company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.
Historically, we have mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance our operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of our company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing. Our company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon us and our shareholders.
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Our company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
