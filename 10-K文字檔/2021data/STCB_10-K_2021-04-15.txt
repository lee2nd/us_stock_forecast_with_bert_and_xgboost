Item 7. MANAGEMENTâ€™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company recorded royalty revenues of $1,365,360 compared to $240,287 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,125,076 or 468.2%. The royalty rate that Starco Brands is paid varies on a per product basis of wholesale sales of our branded and non-corporate owned licensed products. Revenues are from our marketing licensing agreements with The Starco Group and other affiliated companies, for various products mentioned above. The increase in the current period is due to an increase of sales of our Breathe household cleaning line and Winona Popcorn Spray, and to the launching and scaling of the new Breathe hand sanitizer spray. Future sales are not contractural or guaranteed and are dependant on continuing customer purchases of our products.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation expense to Sandy Lang, Marty Goldrod and Rachel Boulds, the only people compensated in the Company, increased $2,212, or 1.2% to $185,537 compared to $183,325 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred $145,416 in professional fees compared to $45,375 in the prior period, an increase of $100,041, or 220.5%. Professional fees are mainly for accounting, auditing and legal services associated with our quarterly filings as a public company and advisory and valuation services. The increase is primarily due to an increase in legal fees.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred $507,278 in marketing, general and administrative expense as compared to $159,365 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $347,913, or 218.3%. The increase can be attributed to an increase of spending on marketing.

Net loss
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a net income of $543,286 as compared to a net loss of $139,964 in the prior year. The increase from the net loss to net income is the result of the large increase of our revenue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $16,137,020 at December 31, 2020 due to the release of shares to strategic people and firms at during the Companies start up phase in 2017 and 2018; however, for the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company had net income of $543,286 and net cash provided by operating activities of $665,770.
We netted $102,798 from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a $100,000 loan from our CEO and funds from other related party cash advances to pay for general operating expenses, compared to $47,415 for the year ended December 31, 2019. A majority of our financing activity consisted of payments to and from related parties.
We currently require cash of about $30,000 a month for operating expenses. Operating expenses include items such as Board Member compensation, administrative costs, insurance, legal and other professional fees, compliance and website maintenance. No cash compensation has ever been paid to the CEO.
We have an outstanding loan of approximately $300,000 from initial invested capital that requires monthly interest payments of $2,545. The loan was used to pay administrative and other operating costs.
On January 24, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note for $100,000 with Ross Sklar, CEO. The note bears interest at 4% per annum, compounded monthly, is unsecured and matures in two years.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 2 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized.
The Company earns its revenue as royalties from the licensing agreements it has with The Starco Group, ("TSG") and other related parties. The Company licenses the right for TSG to manufacture and sell certain Starco Brands products.. The amount of the licensing revenue received varies depending upon the product and is determined beforehand in each agreement. The Company recognizes its revenue only when it receives a report of sales made by TSG to a third party.
The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
