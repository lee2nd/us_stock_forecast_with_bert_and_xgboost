ITEM 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. Unless otherwise specified, the meanings of all defined terms in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are consistent with the meanings of such terms as defined in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, unless otherwise noted, except share and per share amounts.
Recent Developments
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19
outbreak to be a global pandemic and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. As a result, several state and local mandates were implemented that encouraged the practice of social distancing, placed restrictions from individuals gathering in groups and, in many areas, placed complete restrictions on non-essential
movement outside of the home. Shortly after the national emergency declaration, state and local officials began placing restrictions on businesses, some of which allowed To-Go
or curbside service only while others limited capacity in the dining room or midway. By March 20, 2020, all of our 137 operating stores were temporarily closed (including our one new store that opened on March 16, 2020).
On April 30, 2020, our first store re-opened
to the public, as state and local guidelines began to allow dining rooms and arcades to open at limited capacity and/or limited hours of operation. By the end of fiscal 2020, we had progressively re-opened
an additional 101 stores with limited operations. Many of these stores that were re-opened
in limited capacity were required to temporarily close again in areas more severely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, particularly during the fourth quarter holiday season. The Company also opened five new stores in the second half of the fiscal year, all of which commenced construction prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic. As of January 31, 2021, 107 of our 140 stores were open and operating in limited capacity. As of March 28, 2021, fifteen stores continue to remain closed to in-person
customers as a result of state and local COVID-19
restrictions, and we anticipate the majority of these stores will re-open
in some capacity by the end of the our first quarter of fiscal 2021.
As a result of these developments, the Company experienced a significant decrease in traffic which has impacted the Company’s operating results during fiscal 2020. We expect our operating results to continue to be severely impacted until such time that state and local restrictions are lifted, and our dining rooms and midways can re-open
at full capacity. We cannot predict how long the pandemic will last or when the state and local restrictions will be lifted or potentially re-imposed.
In addition, we cannot predict with certainty how quickly our customers will return to our stores once such restrictions have been lifted or the impact this will have on consumer spending habits.
In response to the ongoing pandemic, the Company and its Board of Directors implemented the following measures to enhance financial flexibility:
•
reduced expenses broadly, including by furloughing all of our hourly store team members and approximately 94% of store management personnel, on or about March 19, 2020, while enacting 12-week
salary reductions for remaining managers. In addition, effective March 24, 2020, the Company furloughed all but a small team of essential corporate and administrative staff, enacted 12-week
salary reductions ranging from 10% to 50%, and suspended all cash board fees through the remainder of fiscal 2020. As stores reopen with a reduced workforce, a portion of the furloughed personnel at our stores and corporate office have returned to work;
•
canceled or delayed all non-essential
planned capital spending for the remainder of fiscal 2020;
•
halted or delayed planned store openings after our one store opening in Chattanooga, TN, on March 16, 2020, except five new stores which commenced construction prior to the pandemic that opened during the third and fourth quarter;
•
stopped work on future planned sites and commenced negotiations to terminate related contracts, as applicable;
•
suspended our share repurchase program and declaration of dividends;
•
negotiated amendments to our credit facility resulting in an extension of the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to August 17, 2024;
•
issued $550,000 of senior secured notes, maturing November 1, 2025;
•
sold shares of our common stock, which generated gross proceeds of approximately $185,600; and
•
negotiated with our landlords, vendors, and other business partners to temporarily reduce our lease and contract payments and obtain other concessions. During fiscal 2020, a total of 126 rent relief agreements related to our operating locations and corporate headquarters were initially executed, which generally provide for full deferral for three months beginning April 2020, with partial deferral continuing for periods of up to six months, at approximately 50% of those locations. As the pandemic continued to impact our business into the fourth quarter, the Company renewed negotiations with the majority of these landlords in order to provide additional rent relief, generally seeking to push out or extend the terms of deferral pay back periods and/or provide rent relief beyond the periods in the initial agreements. As of the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had executed 17 of these additional rent relief agreements.
The re-opening
process has been a gradual one with the safety of our team members and customers as our top priority. All of our re-opened
stores are operating with some combination of streamlined menus, reduced games, new seating and game configurations, reduced operating hours, and reduced staff levels. As dining room and midway restrictions continue to ease and sales begin to improve, some labor inefficiencies and increased cleaning and supply costs are anticipated as stores adjust to improved sales volumes and enhanced health and safety protocols. On an ongoing basis, we will also continue to pursue long-term operating efficiencies and fixed cost restructuring opportunities.
General
We are a leading owner and operator of high-volume venues in North America that combine dining and entertainment for both adults and families under the name “Dave & Buster’s”. Founded in 1982, the core of our concept is to offer our customers the opportunity to “Eat Drink Play and Watch” all in one location. Eat and Drink are offered through a full menu of entrées and appetizers and a full selection of non-alcoholic
and alcoholic beverages. Our Play and Watch offerings provide an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports and other televised events. Our brand appeals to a relatively balanced mix of male and female adults, as well as families and teenagers. We believe we appeal to a diverse customer base by providing a highly customizable experience in a dynamic and fun setting.
Our stores average 40,000 square feet, range in size between 16,000 and 70,000 square feet. Prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, our stores were generally open seven days a week, with normal hours of operation typically from 11:30 a.m. to midnight on Sunday through Thursday and 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.
Strategy
During fiscal 2020, we focused on the re-opening
of our stores after mandated shutdowns related to COVID-19,
but also refreshed our strategy to set us up for the next phase of growth. Our refreshed strategy is built on four key components, including offering the latest entertainment to enjoy together, novel food & drink to bring people together, creating an aligned team and integrated experience, and driving customer engagement. For further information about our strategy, refer to “Item 1. Strategy”.
Key Measures of Our Performance
We monitor and analyze several key performance measures to manage our business and evaluate financial and operating performance. These measures include:
Comparable store sales.
Comparable store sales are a year-over-year comparison of sales at stores open at the end of the period that have been open for at least 18 months as of the beginning of each of the fiscal years. It is a key performance indicator used within the industry and is indicative of acceptance of our initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Our comparable store base consisted of 114, 99 and 86 stores as of the end of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
New store openings.
Our ability to expand our business and reach new customers is influenced by the opening of additional stores in both new and existing markets. The success of our new stores is indicative of our brand appeal and the efficacy of our site selection and operating models. During fiscal 2020, we opened six new stores. We currently plan to open four stores in fiscal 2021.
Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
In addition to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide non-GAAP
measures which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP and include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization and Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margin (defined below). These non-GAAP
measures do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Although we use these non-GAAP
measures to assess the operating performance of our business, they have significant limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude certain material costs. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account a number of significant items, including our interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes pre-opening
and other costs which may be important in analyzing our GAAP results. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its utility as a measure of our operating performance has material limitations. Our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA adjust for these amounts because they vary from period to period and do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of the currently underlying business of our stores and therefore complicate comparison of the underlying business between periods. Nevertheless, because of the limitations described above, management does not view Adjusted EBITDA or Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization in isolation and also uses other measures, such as revenues, gross margin, operating income and net income to measure operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss), plus interest expense, net, loss on debt refinancing, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, loss on asset disposal, impairment of long-lived assets, share-based compensation, pre-opening
costs, currency transaction (gains) losses and other costs. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe that it provides useful information to investors and analysts regarding our operating performance. By reporting Adjusted EBITDA, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization and Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margin.
We define “Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization” as operating income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative
expenses and pre-opening
costs. “Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margin” is defined as Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization divided by total revenues. Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margin allows us to evaluate operating performance of each store across stores of varying size and volume.
We believe that Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization is another useful measure in evaluating our operating performance because it removes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at the store level, and the costs of opening new stores, which are non-recurring
at the store level, and thereby enables the comparability of the operating performance of our stores for the periods presented. We also believe that Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization is a useful measure in evaluating our operating performance within the entertainment and dining industry because it permits the evaluation of store-level productivity, efficiency and performance, and we use Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization as a means of evaluating store financial performance compared with our competitors. However, because this measure excludes significant items such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening
costs, as well as our interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization expense, which are important in evaluating our consolidated financial performance from period to period, the value of this measure is limited as a measure of our consolidated financial performance.
Presentation of Operating Results
The Company’s fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except in a 53-week
year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, which ended on January 31, 2021, February 2, 2020, and February 3, 2019, respectively, each contained 52 weeks. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, unless otherwise noted, except share and per share amounts.
Store-Level Variability, Quarterly Fluctuations, Seasonality and Inflation
We have historically operated stores varying in size and have experienced significant variability among stores in volumes, operating results and net investment costs. Our new stores typically open with sales volumes in excess of their expected long-term run-rate
levels, which we refer to as a “honeymoon” effect. We traditionally expect our new store sales volumes in year two to be 10% to 20% lower than our year one targets, and to grow in line with the rest of our comparable store base thereafter. As a result of the substantial revenues associated with each new store, the number and timing of new store openings will result in significant fluctuations in quarterly results.
While fiscal 2020 was a very unusual year with the impact of COVID-19,
historically in the first year of operation, new store operating margins (excluding pre-opening
expenses) typically benefit from honeymoon sales leverage on occupancy, management labor and other fixed costs. This benefit is partially offset by normal inefficiencies in hourly labor and other costs associated with establishing a new store. In year two, operating margins may decline due to the loss of honeymoon sales leverage on fixed costs which is partially offset by improvements in store operating efficiency. Furthermore, rents in our new stores are typically higher than our comparable store base.
Our operating results historically have fluctuated due to seasonal factors. Typically, we have higher revenues associated with the spring and year-end
holidays, which will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school
fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to other quarters. During fiscal 2020, results also fluctuated due to the timing and frequency of temporary closures and operating restrictions due to state and local guidelines imposed due to the COVID-19
pandemic.
We expect that economic and environmental conditions and changes in regulatory legislation will continue to exert pressure on both consumer spending related to entertainment and dining alternatives and availability and
cost of products and supplies. Although there is no assurance that our cost of products will remain stable or that federal, state or local minimum wage rates will not increase beyond amounts currently legislated, the effects of any supplier price increases or wage rate increases are expected to be partially offset by selected menu or game price increases where competitively appropriate. In addition, how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume cannot be predicted, and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on us or our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.
Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019
Results of operations.
The following table sets forth selected data, in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenues (unless otherwise noted) for the periods indicated. All information is derived from the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
(1)
As of January 31, 2021, 107 of our 140 stores were open and 84 of our 114 comparable stores were open. Our total and comparable store counts as of the end of fiscal 2020 exclude a store in Chicago, Illinois and a store in Houston, Texas which are at or near the end of their respective lease terms which the Company has decided not to re-open.
Our store in Duluth (Atlanta), Georgia permanently closed on March 3, 2019 as we did not exercise the renewal option and is excluded from fiscal 2019 store counts and comparable store sales. We opened six new stores during fiscal 2020 and 16 new stores during fiscal 2019.

Results of Operations
Revenues
In response to the COVID-19
outbreak, which was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and a National Public Health Emergency in the United States on March 13, 2020, the Company temporarily closed of all of our 137 stores by March 20, 2020 (including our one new store opening March 16, 2020). On April 30, 2020, our first store re-opened
to the public, as state and local guidelines began to allow dining rooms and arcades to open at limited capacity and/or limited hours of operation. By the end of fiscal 2020, we had progressively re-opened
an additional 101 stores with limited operations. Many of these stores that were re-opened
in limited capacity were required to temporarily close again in areas more severely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, particularly during the fourth quarter holiday season. The Company also opened five new stores in the second half of the fiscal year, all of which commenced construction prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic. As of January 31, 2021, 107 of our 140 stores were open and operating in limited capacity. Of these 107 open stores, 84 are comparable stores. These stores are operating with a combination of limited menus, reduced dining room seating, reduced games in the midway, reduced operating hours and other restrictions referred to as “limited operations”.
Selected revenue and store data for the periods indicated are as follows:
Total revenues decreased $918,179, or 67.8%, to $436,512 in fiscal 2020 compared to total revenues of $1,354,691 in fiscal 2019. The decline in revenue is attributable to fewer store operating weeks in fiscal 2020 as a result of temporary store closures, lower customer volumes due to limited food and beverage and amusement operations and the canceling or postponement of special events as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. For the year ended January 31, 2021, we derived 24.1% of our total revenue from food sales, 12.4% from beverage sales, 63.1% from amusement sales and 0.4% from other sources. For the year ended February 2, 2020 we derived 28.3% of our total revenue from food sales, 13.3% from beverage sales, 57.5% from amusement sales and 0.9% from other sources.
Comparable store revenue decreased $842,588, or 70.2%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to a 46.7% reduction in comparable store operating weeks and lower customer volumes as stores re-opened
with limited operations. As of March 20, 2020, all the Company’s 114 comparable stores were closed due to operating restrictions put in place by local jurisdictions in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. Beginning April 30, 2020, we began re-opening
our stores based on changes in operating restrictions in the various jurisdictions. As of January 31, 2021, 84 of our comparable stores had re-opened
under limited operating conditions. Our individual comparable stores generally experienced gradual increases in weekly sales performance as operating weeks increased. Individual store performance after re-opening
was impacted by changes in local operating restrictions and consumer reactions to changes in local COVID-19
infection rates.
Comparable walk-in
revenues, which accounted for 97.0% of comparable store revenue for fiscal 2020, decreased 67.8% compared to the similar period in fiscal 2019. Comparable store special events revenues, which accounted for 3.0% of comparable store revenue for fiscal 2020, decreased 91.1% compared to the similar period in fiscal 2019 as events were canceled or postponed due to local restrictions on group gathering size and operating restrictions on our business.
Food sales at comparable stores decreased by $252,827, or 74.5%, to $86,382 in fiscal 2020 from $339,209 in fiscal 2019. Beverage sales at comparable stores decreased by $113,917, or 71.6%, to $45,104 in fiscal 2020 from $159,021 in fiscal 2019. Comparable store amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased by $475,844, or 67.7%, to $226,909 from $702,753 in fiscal 2019.
Non-comparable
store revenue decreased $81,195 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. During the first four-week period of fiscal 2020, non-comparable
stores contributed an additional $9,668 of revenue and 54 additional operating weeks over the same period of fiscal 2019. During the remainder of the fifty-two
weeks ended January 31, 2021, non-comparable
store revenue decreased $90,863 for the same reasons noted above, including 130 fewer store operating weeks.
Cost of products
The total cost of products was $74,905 for fiscal 2020 and $233,311 for fiscal 2019. The total cost of products as a percentage of total revenues was 17.2% for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. For the year ended January 31, 2021, the cost of food products was 29.9% of food revenue, the cost of beverage products was 25.3% of beverage revenue, and the amusement and other cost of products was 10.7% of amusement and other revenues. For the year ended February 2, 2020, the cost of food products was 27.2% of food revenue, the cost of beverage products was 24.3% of beverage revenue, and the amusement and other cost of products was 10.8% of amusement and other revenues.
Cost of food and beverage products decreased to $45,207 in fiscal 2020 compared to $148,196 for fiscal 2019. Cost of food and beverage products, as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, increased 200 basis points to 28.3% for fiscal 2020 from 26.3% for fiscal 2019. Cost of food and beverage products during fiscal 2020 was negatively impacted by food and beverage spoilage of approximately $3,567 associated with store closures and the upcoming new menu rollout, partially offset by cost reductions resulting from vendor payment negotiations.
Cost of amusement and other decreased to $29,698 in fiscal 2020 compared to $85,115 in fiscal 2019. The costs of amusement and other, as a percentage of amusement and other revenues, decreased 10 basis points to 10.7% for fiscal 2020 from 10.8% for fiscal 2019. This decrease was driven by lower freight costs, lower cost per ticket and higher revenue per game play credit sold as a result of less discounting of amusement revenues, partially offset by an unfavorable shift in ticket redemption patterns.
Operating payroll and benefits
Total operating payroll and benefits decreased by $205,495, or 63.6%, to $117,475 in fiscal 2020 compared to $322,970 in fiscal 2019. Nearly all of our store workforce, with the exception of a small team of essential personnel, were furloughed in mid-March
2020. Hourly team members returned only as stores re-opened
and at reduced staffing levels. The total cost of operating payroll and benefits, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 310 basis points to 26.9% in fiscal 2020 compared to 23.8% for fiscal 2019. Favorable results in hourly labor were offset by the deleveraging impact of management labor as a result of the temporary store closures and continued benefit coverage for furloughed team members. Additionally, late in the third quarter, we recalled a core group of store managers at unopened stores and then maintained this core group throughout the fourth quarter to ensure retention of key team members.
Other store operating expenses
Other store operating expenses decreased by $129,967, or 30.3%, to $299,464 in fiscal 2020 compared to $429,431 in fiscal 2019. Decreased spend on marketing, maintenance and restaurant services due to temporary store closures and $1,000 insurance proceeds related to the COVID-19
business disruptions were partially offset by a net loss on derivatives of $1,729 and special charges of $13,727 (consisting of a charge for impairment of long-lived assets of $12,248 and lease termination costs of $1,479). We have also incurred additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our team members and customers. Other store operating
expense as a percent of total revenues increased to 68.6% in fiscal 2020 compared to 31.8% in fiscal 2019. This increase was primarily due to sales deleveraging of occupancy costs and utilities as a result of the temporary store closures and the charges for impairment.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by $22,254, or 32.0%, to $47,215 in fiscal 2020 compared to $69,469 in fiscal 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by lower labor costs due to continued furloughs and elimination of a significant number of positions at our corporate office, temporarily reducing pay and benefits for team members that were not furloughed for a twelve-week period and the elimination of the corporate bonus program, lower professional services, and reduced travel expenses. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 570 basis points to 10.8% in fiscal 2020 compared to 5.1% in fiscal 2019, due primarily to unfavorable leverage on revenue decreases.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $6,329, or 4.8%, to $138,789 in fiscal 2020 compared to $132,460 in fiscal 2019. Increased depreciation due to our 2020 and 2019 capital expenditures for new stores, operating initiatives, games and maintenance capital, was partially offset by other assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives.
Pre-opening
costs
Pre-opening
costs decreased by $7,695 to $11,276 in fiscal 2020 compared to $18,971 in fiscal 2019 due to a decrease in the number of new store openings in the current year, as construction was put on hold or delayed after the disruption of our business from the COVID-19
pandemic, with pre-opening
costs being primarily limited to pre-opening
rent expense, including three future sites for which the leases have commenced.
Interest expense, net and Loss on debt refinance
Interest expense, net increased by $15,953 to $36,890 in fiscal 2020 compared to $20,937 in fiscal 2019 due primarily to an increase in interest rates and partially due to an increase in average outstanding debt. In connection with the October 27, 2020 debt refinancing, which is explained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded a charge of $904 during fiscal 2020.
Provision for income taxes
The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 was a benefit of 28.7% compared to a provision of 21.1% in fiscal 2019, primarily due to the impact of a decrease in operating earnings before income tax as well as the impact of provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), including technical amendments to qualified improvement property and the impact of carrying back tax net operating losses from fiscal years 2020 and 2019 to years with a higher federal corporate income tax rate.

Results of Operations
Revenues
Total revenues increased $89,390 or 7.1%, to $1,354,691 in fiscal 2019 compared to total revenues of $1,265,301 in fiscal 2018. For the year ended February 2, 2020, we derived 28.3% of our total revenue from food sales, 13.3% from beverage sales, 57.5% from amusement sales and 0.9% from other sources. For the year ended February 3, 2019 we derived 28.9% of our total revenue from food sales, 13.5% from beverage sales, 56.8% from amusement sales and 0.8% from other sources.
The net increase in revenues for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 were from the following sources:
Comparable store revenue decreased $28,408 or 2.6%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Comparable store revenue compared to the prior fiscal year was, in part, negatively impacted by an unfavorable shift in the current year holiday/school break calendar, sales transfers to new stores that we opened in markets where we operate and increased competitive pressure. Comparable walk-in
revenues, which accounted for 89.6% of comparable store revenue for fiscal 2019, decreased $29,304, or 3.0% compared to fiscal 2018. Comparable store special events revenues, which accounted for 10.4% of consolidated comparable store revenue for fiscal 2019, increased $896, or 0.8% compared to fiscal 2018.
Food sales at comparable stores decreased by $13,303, or 4.3%, to $296,389 for fiscal 2019 from $309,692 in fiscal 2018. Beverage sales at comparable stores decreased by $5,356, or 3.7%, to $139,446 for fiscal 2019 from $144,802 in the 2018 comparison period. The decrease in food and beverage unit sales at comparable stores was partially offset by an overall increase in menu prices. Comparable store amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2019 decreased by $9,749, or 1.6%, to $608,243 from $617,992 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in amusement sales was due in part to lower customer volumes partially offset by various pricing initiatives in the current year, including an increase in new card fees with the launch of our RFID power card.
Non-comparable
store revenue increased by $117,592 for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in non-comparable
store revenue was primarily driven by 811 additional operating store weeks contributed by our thirty-seven non-comparable
stores, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the closure of our store in Duluth (Atlanta), Georgia on March 3, 2019. The year-over-year decline in average weekly non-comparable
store sales during fiscal 2019 is driven primarily by a honeymoon effect on fiscal 2017 and 2018 opening sales volumes and larger than expected declines in two of those markets which were adversely impacted by slowdowns in their local economies following a natural disaster. Additionally, stores opened during fiscal 2019 experienced slightly lower opening volumes than our 2018 openings.
Cost of products
The total cost of products was $233,311 for fiscal 2019 and $220,263 for fiscal 2018. The total cost of products as a percentage of total revenues was 17.2% and 17.4% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. For the year ended February 2, 2020, the cost of food products was 27.2% of food revenue, the cost of beverage products was 24.3% of beverage revenue, and the amusement and other cost of products was 10.8% of amusement and other revenues. For the year ended February 3, 2019, the cost of food products was 26.8% of food revenue, the cost of beverage products was 24.2% of beverage revenue, and the amusement and other cost of products was 11.1% of amusement and other revenues.
Cost of food and beverage products increased to $148,196 in fiscal 2019 compared to $139,199 for fiscal 2018 due primarily to the increased sales volume related to new store openings. Cost of food and beverage products, as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, increased 40 basis points to 26.3% for fiscal 2019 from 25.9% for fiscal 2018. Higher meat costs resulting from our upgraded steak products, higher poultry costs due to our “All You Can Eat” wings promotion and higher bar consumable costs due to our shift to fresh juices at the bar as well as the impact of our larger non-comparable
store group, were partially offset by declines in seafood costs and increases in food and beverage menu prices.
Cost of amusement and other increased to $85,115 in fiscal 2019 compared to $81,064 in fiscal 2018. The costs of amusement and other, as a percentage of amusement and other revenues, decreased 30 basis points to 10.8% for fiscal 2019 from 11.1% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in cost of amusement and other as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to a shift in game play to non-redemption
games and an increase in the price of power cards.
Operating payroll and benefits
Total operating payroll and benefits increased by $26,046, or 8.8%, to $322,970 in fiscal 2019 compared to $296,924 in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to labor associated with the additional operating store weeks of our non-comparable
stores. The total cost of operating payroll and benefits, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 30 basis points to 23.8% in fiscal 2019 compared to 23.5% for fiscal 2018. This increase was due to an average hourly wage rate increase of approximately 4.1% and unfavorable leverage on decreased comparable store sales, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.
Other store operating expenses
Other store operating expenses increased by $45,276, or 11.8%, to $429,431 in fiscal 2019 compared to $384,155 in fiscal 2018, primarily due to new store openings. Other store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 140 basis points to 31.8% in fiscal 2019 compared to 30.4% in fiscal 2018. This increase was due primarily to higher occupancy costs associated with our non-comparable
stores and the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales, the absence of hurricane-related business interruption proceeds recorded in the prior year and incremental legal costs.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $7,948, or 12.9%, to $69,469 in fiscal 2019 compared to $61,521 in fiscal 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by professional services at our corporate headquarters including costs related to shareholder activism. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 20 basis points to 5.1% in fiscal 2019 compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2018, for the same reasons above offset by favorable leverage on revenue increases.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $14,185, or 12.0%, to $132,460 in fiscal 2019 compared to $118,275 in fiscal 2018. Increased depreciation due to our 2018 and 2017 capital expenditures for new stores, operating initiatives, including remodels, games and maintenance capital, was partially offset by other assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives.
Pre-opening
costs
Pre-opening
costs decreased by $4,192 to $18,971 in fiscal 2019 compared to $23,163 in fiscal 2018 due to the number and timing of new store openings and stores in development.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net increased by $7,824 to $20,937 in fiscal 2019 compared to $13,113 in fiscal 2018 due primarily to an increase in average outstanding debt partially offset by slightly lower interest rates.
Provision for income taxes
The effective income tax rate increased to 21.1% in fiscal 2019 compared to 20.7% in fiscal 2018. This increase primarily reflects lower excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, offset partially with higher tax credits.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In response to the business disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, the Company has taken the following actions to enable it to meet its obligations over the next twelve months:
During fiscal year 2020, we:
•
reduced expenses broadly;
•
canceled or delayed all non-essential
planned capital spending for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and halted or delayed all planned store openings, except stores that commenced construction prior to the COVID-19
pandemic;
•
indefinitely suspended our share repurchase program and cash dividends and drew down substantially all the remaining credit available under our $500,000 revolving credit facility during our first quarter of fiscal 2020;
•
sold shares of our common stock, generating gross proceeds of $185,600;
•
negotiated two amendments with our lenders, resulting in an extension of the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to August 17, 2024 and relief from testing compliance with certain financial covenants until the last day of the fiscal quarter ending on May 1, 2022;
•
issued $550,000 of senior secured notes, maturing November 1, 2025;
•
negotiated with our landlords, vendors, and other business partners to temporarily reduce our lease and contract payments and obtain other concessions. During fiscal 2020, a total of 126 rent relief agreements related to our operating locations and corporate headquarters were initially executed, which generally provide for full deferral for three months beginning April 2020, with partial deferral continuing for periods of up to six months, at approximately 50% of those locations. As the pandemic continued to impact our business into the fourth quarter, the Company renewed negotiations with the majority of these landlords in order to provide additional rent relief, generally seeking to push out or extend the terms of deferral pay back periods and/or provide rent relief beyond the periods in the initial agreements. As of the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had executed 17 of these additional rent relief agreements; and
•
submitted a proposal, approved by our shareholders, increasing the number of shares available for incentive awards, which enables management to maintain key talent while preserving the Company’s liquidity by minimizing cash outlays.
Although uncertainty surrounds the timing of re-opening
of our remaining stores and lifting of capacity restrictions and other requirements, as well as how quickly customers will return to our stores, due to continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses, the Company has taken measures to provide sufficient liquidity to meet estimated cash flow needs and covenant compliance obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements.
Debt and Derivatives
Effective April 14, 2020, we amended our existing credit facility, which provided relief from compliance with financial covenants through the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The interest rate spread increased to 2.00% plus a LIBOR floor of 1.00%.
On October 27, 2020, the Company issued $550,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior secured notes (the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes accrues from October 27, 2020 and is payable in arrears on November 1 and May 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2021. The Notes mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed, and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the related indenture. The Notes were issued by Dave &Buster’s, Inc. and are unconditionally guaranteed by Dave & Buster’s Holdings, Inc. and certain of Dave &Buster’s, Inc. existing and future wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, which is substantially the same as the guarantors of the Company’s existing credit facility.
Concurrent and subject to the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into a second amendment to its existing credit facility, which included relief from testing compliance with certain financial covenants until the last day of the fiscal quarter ending on May 1, 2022. During the financial covenant suspension period the Company is required to maintain a minimum liquidity (primarily availability under the credit facility) of $150,000. The second amendment extended the maturity date of the $500,000 revolving portion of the facility from August 17, 2022 to August 17, 2024, increased the interest rate spread to 4.00% during the financial covenant suspension period, and instituted a 1.00% utilization fee during that same time period. The utilization fee is due at maturity. After the financial covenant suspension period, the interest rate spread ranges from 1.25% to 3.00%. The second amendment terminated the term loan portion of the credit facility, which triggered payment of $1,900 of lender debt costs associated with the first amendment.
The Company used the proceeds of the Notes offering, along with cash on hand, to repay the $255,000 principal balance of the term loan facility, $463,000 of borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and related accrued interest. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $18,300, which are being amortized over the terms of the respective Notes and revolving credit facility. The Company also recorded a loss of $904 related to the unamortized debt costs associated with the term portion of the credit facility.
For fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, the Company’s weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 5.40% and 3.98%, respectively. We expect this rate to increase in future quarters as a result of the issuance of the Notes and the second amendment to the credit facility. As of January 31, 2021, we had letters of credit outstanding of $9,686 and an unused commitment balance of $430,314 under the revolving credit facility.
Our credit facility and Notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make loans or advances to subsidiaries and other entities, pay dividends, acquire other businesses or sell assets.
During fiscal 2019, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate credit facility. Our swap agreements with our derivative counterparties contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness and repayment of the indebtedness has been accelerated, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our swap agreements, which were de-designated
as hedges effective April 14, 2020, the date of the first amendment to our credit facility.
Dividends and Share Repurchases
The Company had previously established a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase shares on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, and through trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1
of the Exchange Act. As a result of the impacts to our business arising from the COVID -19
pandemic, share purchases and dividend payments have been indefinitely suspended, and the share repurchase program was allowed to expire at the end of fiscal 2020.
Cash Flow Summary
At January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11,891.
Operating Activities
- Cash flow from operations typically provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations, and occupancy costs. Cash from operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, the timing of cash receipts and payments, and vendor payment terms.
Cash flow from operating activities decreased $338,170 in fiscal 2020 compared fiscal 2019 driven primarily by the closure of all of our 137 operating stores as of March 20, 2020. Operations ceased until April 30, 2020, when we re-opened
our first store, followed by the progressive re-opening
of 106 additional stores with limited operations through the end of the fiscal year, including five new stores that opened in the second half of fiscal 2020. The impact of approximately 2,847 fewer store weeks and limited operations was lessened somewhat by reduced income tax payments as well as our efforts to actively manage the Company’s daily cash flows, including deferrals and short payments of rent and other payments to landlords.
Investing Activities
- Cash flow from investing activities primarily reflects capital expenditures.
•
In fiscal 2020, the Company spent approximately $64,000 ($51,000 net of payments from landlords) for new store construction and operating improvement initiatives, $10,000 for game refreshment and $9,000 for maintenance capital.
•
In fiscal 2019, the Company spent approximately $187,000 ($153,000 net of payments from landlords) for new store construction and operating improvement initiatives, $19,000 for game refreshment and $22,000 for maintenance capital.
•
In fiscal 2018, the Company spent approximately $164,500 ($112,500 net of payments from landlords) for new store construction and operating improvement initiatives, $29,000 for game refreshment, and $22,500 for maintenance capital.
Financing Activities
- Cash flow from financing activities primarily reflected:
•
In fiscal 2020, prior to the debt refinancing, the Company drew down substantially all the available credit under our revolving credit facility, or approximately $100,000, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately $182,200 from the issuance of shares of our common stock in April and May 2020. In October 2020, the Company issued $550,000 of senior secured notes in a private offering and amended the existing credit facility. The proceeds from the offering, along with cash on hand, were used to pay debt issuance costs, the $255,000 balance of the term portion of the credit facility, and $463,000 of outstanding borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility. Subsequent to the refinancing, the Company had net borrowings of $34,000 under the revolver.
•
In fiscal 2019, approximately $297,000 of share repurchases and approximately $16,000 of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $254,000 of net proceeds from borrowings of debt.
•
In fiscal 2018, approximately $149,000 of share repurchases and approximately $11,500 of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $27,000 of net proceeds from borrowings.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The following table sets forth contractual obligations as of January 31, 2021:
(1)
Available commitments under the revolving credit facility were $430,314 as of January 31, 2021, subject to a $150,000 liquidity covenant.
(2)
The cash obligations for the variable interest requirements on the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the unused commitment are based on an interest rate of 6.00% and 0.50%, respectively, through the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, reduced to 4.00% and 0.40%, respectively, for the remainder of the term of the credit facility. The interest requirement on the senior secured notes is based on a fixed rate of 7.625%.
(3)
Our operating leases generally provide for one or more renewal options. These renewal options allow us to extend the term of the lease for a specified time at an established annual lease payment. Future obligations related to lease renewal options that have been exercised or were reasonably certain to be exercised as of the lease origination date, have been included in the table above.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We have no material off-balance
sheet arrangements.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
The above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and require the greatest amount of judgment by management. Judgment or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for amusement operations
.
Amusement revenues are primarily recognized upon utilization of game play credits on Power Cards purchased and used by customers to activate video and redemption games. Redemption games allow customers to earn tickets, which may be redeemed for prizes in our WIN! area. We have deferred a portion of amusement revenues for the estimated unfulfilled performance obligations based on an estimated rate of future use by customers of unused game play credits and the material right provided to customers to redeem tickets in the future for prizes. We estimate the amount of deferred revenue based upon credits and tickets remaining on Power Cards, historic game play credit and ticket utilization patterns and estimates of the standalone selling prices of game play credits and the customer material right. The standalone selling price of the customer material right is estimated using an equivalent chip cost plus margin approach. For purposes of recognizing revenue, the total amount collected from each customer is then allocated between the two performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price of each obligation.
Accounting for impairment of long-lived assets.
Annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying values of these assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate long-lived assets related to each store to be held and used in business, including property and equipment and right-of-use
(“ROU”) assets. In determining the recoverability of the asset value, an analysis is performed at the individual store level, since this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances, including the maturity of the store, changes in the economic environment, unfavorable changes in legal factors or business climate and future operating plans. The more significant inputs used in determining our estimate of the projected undiscounted cash flows included future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the estimate of the remaining useful life of the assets. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge, if any, for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, which is estimated based on discounted projected future operating cash flows of the store over the remaining service life using a risk adjusted discount rate that is commensurate with the inherent risk.
