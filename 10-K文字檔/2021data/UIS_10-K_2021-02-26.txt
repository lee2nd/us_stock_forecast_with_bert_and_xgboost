ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which continues to
impact the U.S. and the world. The impact from the rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19
outbreak is uncertain, disrupting the business of our customers and partners, and has impacted our business and consolidated
results of operations and could impact our financial condition in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2020,
revenue declined by 8.8% from the prior-year. The decline was largely due to expected declines in the company’s
U.K. check-processing joint venture, impacts of COVID-19, including declines in field services, travel and entertainment and
volume-based BPO contracts. The company is unable to accurately predict the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the availability and effectiveness of a vaccine, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the business of our customers and partners and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. The company has taken steps to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on its business such as temporary salary reductions for the senior leadership team, reduction of third-party spend such as contractors, redeploying its workforce based on shifting needs of the business, limiting travel and unnecessary expenses and reducing discretionary capital expenditures where possible. The company will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to its business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.
On March 13, 2020, the company completed the sale of its U.S. Federal business to Science Applications International Corporation for a cash purchase price of $1.2 billion. Beginning January 1, 2020, the historical results of the company’s U.S. Federal business have been reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Prior-periods financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the company’s U.S. Federal business as discontinued operations. Depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and significant non-cash operating and investing activities related to the U.S. Federal business were immaterial for all periods.
On April 15, 2020, the company redeemed all $440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes) for a redemption price equal to 105.375% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes redeemed plus accrued, but unpaid interest, to, but not including, the redemption date. The redemption price paid was $487.3 million and is made up of the following: $440.0 million principal amount due, $23.65 million call premium and $23.65 million of accrued interest through April 14, 2020. As a result, the company recorded a debt extinguishment charge in other expense, net of $28.5 million consisting of the premium of $23.65 million and write off of $4.8 million of unamortized discount and fees related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes.
On October 29, 2020, the company issued $485.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes). The 2027 Notes will pay interest semiannually on May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2021, and will mature on November 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes was contributed to the company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan.
Contemporaneously with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, the company and the subsidiary guarantors entered into an amendment and restatement of the company’s secured revolving credit facility (the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility) that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $145.0 million (with a limit on letters of credit of $40.0 million), with an accordion feature provision allowing for an increase in credit facility up to $175.0 million. The amendment and restatement extended the maturity from October 2022 to October 2025 and modified certain other terms and covenants.
On November 25, 2020, the company gave notice to the holders of its 2021 Notes that it had elected to satisfy its conversion obligation in respect of such conversion by the combination settlement method, whereby the company shall pay and deliver to the converting holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes being converted a settlement amount equal to the sum of $1,000 plus shares of the company’s common stock. Assuming that all of the holders of the 2021 Notes convert their 2021 Notes into shares of the company’s common stock, in March of 2021, the company will deliver to the note holders $84.2 million of cash and approximately 4.6 million shares of the company’s common stock. The company estimates that it will receive approximately 1.2 million shares upon exercise of the capped call transactions; therefore, the number of outstanding shares of common stock will increase by approximately 3.4 million shares.
In 2020, the company contributed $791.1 million to its U.S. qualified pension plans. In December 2020, the company completed a lump-sum cash-out offer for eligible former associates who had deferred vested benefit under the company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans to receive the value of their entire pension benefit in a lump-sum payment. As a result, the pension plan trust made lump sum payments to approximately 3,500 former associates of $276.0 million and the company recorded a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $142.1 million.
In 2020, the company reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Unisys Corporation of $317.7 million, or a loss of $5.05 per diluted share, compared with a 2019 net loss of $92.2 million, or a loss of $1.65 per diluted share.
Results of operations
Company results
Revenue for 2020 was $2.03 billion compared with $2.22 billion for 2019, a decrease of 8.8%. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 1-percentage-point negative impact on revenue in the current year compared with the year-ago period.
Services revenue decreased 10.6% and Technology revenue increased 1.0%. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 1-percentage-point negative impact on Services revenue and a 1-percentage-point negative impact on Technology revenue in the current year compared with the year-ago period.
Revenue from international operations in 2020 and 2019 was $1.24 billion and $1.40 billion, respectively. Foreign currency had a 2-percentage-point negative impact on international revenue in 2020 compared with 2019. Revenue from U.S. operations was $0.78 billion in 2020 and $0.82 billion in 2019.
The decline in Services revenue in 2020 compared with 2019 was largely due to expected declines in the company’s U.K. check-processing joint venture; impacts of COVID-19, including declines in field services, travel and entertainment and volume-based BPO contracts.
Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method whereby prior periods were not restated. This resulted in an adjustment to 2018 Technology revenue and profit of $53.0 million ($47.7 million, net of tax, or $0.65 per diluted share). The adjustment represents revenue from software license extensions and renewals, which were contracted for in the fourth quarter of 2017 and properly recorded as revenue at that time under the revenue recognition rules then in effect (Topic 605). Topic 606 requires revenue related to software license renewals or extensions to be recorded when the new license term begins, which in the case of the $53.0 million, was January 1, 2018.
Revenue for 2019 was $2.22 billion compared with $2.25 billion for 2018, a decrease of 1.3%. Excluding the Topic 606 adjustment of $53.0 million, revenue increased 1.1%. Services revenue increased 1.9% and Technology revenue decreased 16.1%. Excluding the Topic 606 adjustment, Technology revenue declined 3.1%.
Revenue from international operations in 2019 and 2018 was $1.40 billion and $1.59 billion, respectively. Without the Topic 606 adjustment, 2018 revenue from international operations was $1.54 billion. Revenue from U.S. operations was $0.82 billion in 2019 and $0.67 billion in 2018. Excluding the Topic 606 adjustment, U.S. revenue in 2018 was $0.66 billion.
During 2020, the company recognized cost-reduction charges and other costs of $95.5 million. The charges (credits) related to work-force reductions were $25.5 million, principally related to severance costs, and were comprised of: (a) a charge of $39.0 million and (b) a credit of $13.5 million for changes in estimates. In addition, the company recorded charges of $70.0 million comprised of $32.3 million for foreign currency losses related to exiting foreign countries, $24.0 million for asset impairments and $13.7 million for other expenses related to the cost-reduction effort.
During 2019, the company recognized cost-reduction charges and other costs of $28.7 million. The charges related to work-force reductions were $22.1 million, principally related to severance costs, and were comprised of: (a) a charge of $25.7 million and (b) a credit of $3.6 million for changes in estimates. In addition, the company recorded charges of $6.6 million comprised of $4.6 million for lease abandonment costs, $1.1 million for asset write-offs and $0.9 million for other expenses related to the cost-reduction effort.
During 2018, the company recognized cost-reduction charges and other costs of $19.7 million. The charges related to work-force reductions were $19.0 million, principally related to severance costs, and were comprised of: (a) a charge of $27.7 million and (b) a credit of $8.7 million for changes in estimates. In addition, the company recorded a charge of $0.7 million for changes in estimates related to idle leased facilities costs.
The cost reduction charges (credits) were recorded in the following statement of income classifications:
Gross profit as a percent of total revenue, or gross profit percent, was 23.8% in 2020, 24.0% in 2019 and 26.0% in 2018. Gross profit in 2019 was positively impacted by $19.8 million related to the change in useful life of the company’s proprietary enterprise software. See Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Excluding this change, 2019 gross profit percent was 23.1%. Gross profit in 2018 was positively impacted by the Topic 606 adjustment described above. Excluding this adjustment, 2018 gross profit percent was 24.2%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $369.4 million in 2020 (18.2% of revenue), $364.8 million in 2019 (16.4% of revenue) and $340.3 million in 2018 (15.1% of revenue). Exclusive of cost reduction charges in 2020 and 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses would have declined.
Research and development (R&D) expenses in 2020 were $26.6 million compared with $31.3 million in 2019 and $31.9 million in 2018.
In 2020, the company reported an operating profit of $87.0 million compared with an operating profit of $137.9 million in 2019 and $212.1 million in 2018. The decline in 2020 was principally due to higher cost reduction charges. Operating profit in 2018 was positively impacted by the Topic 606 adjustment described above. Excluding this adjustment, operating profit in 2018 was $159.1 million.
Interest expense was $29.2 million in 2020, $62.1 million in 2019 and $64.0 million in 2018. The decline in 2020 was principally due to the redemption of the company’s 2022 Notes on April 14, 2020. See Note 15, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other (expense), net was $329.6 million in 2020 compared with $136.4 million in 2019 and $77.1 million in 2018. In 2020, the company recorded a settlement charge of $142.1 million related to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and a foreign exchange charge of $32.3 million related to substantial completion of liquidation of foreign subsidiaries. See Note 6, “Other (expense), net” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of other (expense), net.
Pension expense for 2020 was $235.3 million compared with $92.7 million in 2019 and $79.7 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was principally due to the $142.1 million U.S. settlement charge, discussed above. For 2021, the company expects to recognize pension expense of approximately $418.6 million, which includes estimated settlement charges of $373 million related to plans in the Netherlands, the United States and Switzerland of $186 million, $158 million and $29 million, respectively (see below, in financial condition, information concerning expected 2021 pension plan settlements). The company records the service cost component of pension income or expense, as well as other employee-related costs such as payroll taxes and medical insurance costs, in operating income in the following income statement categories: cost of revenue; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research and development expenses. The amount allocated to each category is based on where the salaries of active employees are charged. All other components of pension income or expense are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income.
Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes in 2020 was a loss of $271.8 million compared with a loss of $60.6 million in 2019 and income of $71.0 million in 2018. Included in the loss in 2020 was the $142.1 million U.S. pension settlement charge as well as $95.5 million cost reduction charges. Income before income taxes in 2018 was positively impacted by the Topic 606 adjustment described above. Excluding this adjustment, income before income taxes in 2018 was $18.0 million.
The provision for income taxes in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $45.4 million, $27.7 million and $46.0 million, respectively.
The company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The company records a tax provision or benefit for those international subsidiaries that do not have a full valuation allowance against their deferred tax assets. Any profit or loss recorded for the company’s U.S. operations will have no provision or benefit associated with it due to the company’s valuation allowance, except with respect to refundable tax credits and withholding taxes not creditable against future taxable income. As a result, the company’s provision or benefit for taxes may vary significantly period to period depending on the geographic distribution of income.
The realization of the company’s net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income within certain foreign jurisdictions. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require the company to record an additional valuation allowance against the remaining deferred tax assets. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance would result in additional or lower income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on that period’s earnings.
Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Unisys Corporation for 2020 was a loss of $317.7 million, or $5.05 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $92.2 million, or $1.65 per diluted share in 2019 and income of $21.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in 2018.
Segment results
The company has two business segments: Services and Technology. Revenue classifications within the Services and Technology segment are as follows:
•Cloud and infrastructure services. This represents revenue from helping clients apply cloud and as-a-service delivery models to capitalize on business opportunities, make their end users more productive and manage and secure their IT infrastructure and operations more economically.
•Application services. This represents revenue from helping clients transform their business processes by developing and managing new leading-edge applications for select industries, offering advanced data analytics and modernizing existing enterprise applications.
•Business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This represents revenue from the management of critical processes and functions for clients in target industries, helping them improve performance and reduce costs.
•Technology. This represents revenue from designing and developing software operating environments and related applications for high-intensity enterprise computing, including the procurement of hardware and other related products to help clients improve security and flexibility, reduce costs and improve the efficiency of their data-center environments.
The accounting policies of each business segment are the same as those followed by the company as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are priced as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Accordingly, the Technology segment recognizes intersegment revenue and manufacturing profit on software and hardware shipments to customers under Services contracts. The Services segment, in turn, recognizes customer revenue and marketing profits on such shipments of company software and hardware to customers. The Services segment also includes the sale of software and hardware products sourced from third parties that are sold to customers through the company’s Services channels. In the company’s consolidated statements of income, the manufacturing costs of products sourced from the Technology segment and sold to Services customers are reported in cost of revenue for Services.
Also included in the Technology segment’s sales and operating profit are sales of software and hardware sold to the Services segment for internal use in Services engagements. The amount of such profit included in operating income of the Technology segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $7.8 million, $5.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The profit on these transactions is eliminated in Corporate.
The company evaluates business segment performance based on operating income exclusive of postretirement income or expense, restructuring charges and unusual and nonrecurring items, which are included in Corporate. All other corporate and centrally incurred costs are allocated to the business segments based principally on revenue, employees, square footage or usage. See Note 20, “Segment information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Information by business segment is presented below:
Gross profit percent and operating income percent are as a percent of total revenue.
Customer revenue by classes of similar products or services, by segment, is presented below:
In the Services segment, customer revenue was $1.7 billion in 2020, $1.9 billion in 2019 and $1.9 billion in 2018. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 1-percentage-point negative impact on revenue in 2020 compared with 2019. The decline in revenue in 2020 compared with 2019 was largely due to expected declines in the company’s U.K. check-processing joint venture; impacts of COVID-19, including declines in field services, travel and entertainment and volume-based BPO contracts.
Revenue from cloud & infrastructure services was $1.2 billion in 2020, down 8.5% compared with 2019. Revenue in 2019 was $1.3 billion, up 5.0% compared with 2018. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 1-percentage-point negative impact on cloud & infrastructure services revenue in the current period compared with the year-ago period.
Application services revenue decreased 5.6% in 2020 compared with 2019. Revenue in 2019 was down 2.8% from 2018. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 3-percentage-point negative impact on application services revenue in the current period compared with the year-ago period.
Business process outsourcing solutions revenue decreased 29.8% in 2020 compared with 2019. Revenue in 2019 was down 6.3% from 2018. Foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant impact on business process outsourcing solutions revenue in the current period compared with the year-ago period. The declines were due to reductions in volumes at the company’s check-processing operations.
Services gross profit percent was 16.5% in 2020 compared with 16.2% in 2019 and 15.9% in 2018. Services operating profit percent was 0.7% in 2020 compared with 1.1% in 2019 and 0.5% in 2018. Operating profit in 2020 compared with 2019 was negatively impacted by the flow-through effect of lower revenues related to the COVID-19 impact.
In the Technology segment, customer revenue increased 1.0% to $333.4 million in 2020 compared with $330.1 million in 2019. Foreign currency translation had a 1-percentage-point negative impact on Technology revenue in 2020 compared with 2019. Technology revenue in 2019 was $330.1 million compared with $393.6 million in 2018, a decline of 16.1%. The decline in Technology revenue in 2019 compared with 2018 is principally attributable to the 2018 Topic 606 adjustment of $53.0 million described above. Excluding the Topic adjustment, Technology customer revenue declined 3.1%.
Technology gross profit percent was 65.0% in 2020 compared with 69.0% in 2019 and 73.0% in 2018. The Technology operating profit percent was 40.8% in 2020 compared with 46.1% in 2019 and 53.6% in 2018. The decrease in gross profit percent and operating profit percent in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to a lower mix of higher margin software sales. Excluding the impact of the Topic 606 adjustment, 2018 gross profit percent was 69.1% and the operating profit percent was 46.9%.
New accounting pronouncements
See Note 3, “Recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on the company’s consolidated financial statements.
Financial condition
The company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations and its ABL credit facility, discussed below. The company and certain international subsidiaries have access to uncommitted lines of credit from various banks. The company believes that it will have adequate sources of liquidity to meet its expected cash requirements through at least the next twelve months.
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 were $898.5 million compared with $538.8 million at December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, $326.3 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and branches operating outside of the U.S. The company may not be able to readily transfer up to one-third of these funds out of the country in which they are located as a result of local restrictions, contractual or other legal arrangements or commercial considerations. Additionally, any transfers of these funds to the U.S. in the future may require the company to accrue or pay withholding or other taxes on a portion of the amount transferred. See Note 7, “Income taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the company’s intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
During 2020, cash used for operating activities was $681.2 million compared with cash provided by operations of $123.9 million in 2019. The increase in cash usage during 2020 was principally due to higher cash contributions to the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, discussed above.
Cash provided by investing activities in 2020 was $1,041.6 million compared with cash usage of $158.2 million in 2019. On March 13, 2020, the company sold its U.S. Federal business and received net cash proceeds of $1,162.9 million (net of working capital adjustments and transaction costs). Net proceeds of investments were $9.3 million in 2020 compared with net proceeds of $2.8 million in 2019. Proceeds from investments and purchases of investments represent derivative financial instruments used to manage the company’s currency exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, capital additions of properties were $27.7 million in 2020 compared with $38.0 million in 2019, capital additions of outsourcing assets were $30.1 million in 2020 compared with $48.8 million in 2019 and the investment in marketable software was $72.3 million in 2020 compared with $73.0 million in 2019.
Cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was $5.1 million compared with cash used for financing activities of $38.0 million in 2019. The increase in cash provided in 2020 is principally due to the 2019 convertible notes exchange partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of debt as described below.
At December 31, 2020, total debt was $629.9 million compared with $579.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the issuance of the 6.875% senior secured notes, offset in part by the redemption of the 10.750%, both of which are described below.
On April 15, 2020, the company redeemed all $440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes) for a redemption price equal to 105.375% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes redeemed plus accrued, but unpaid interest, to, but not including, the redemption date. The redemption price paid was $487.3 million and is made up of the following: $440.0 million principal amount due, $23.65 million call premium and $23.65 million of accrued interest through April 14, 2020. As a result, the company recorded a debt extinguishment charge in other expense, net of $28.5 million consisting of the premium of $23.65 million and write off of $4.8 million of unamortized discount and fees related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes.
On October 29, 2020, the company issued $485.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes). The 2027 Notes will pay interest semiannually on May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2021, and will mature on November 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed. The 2027 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Unisys Holding Corporation, Unisys NPL, Inc., and Unisys AP Investment Company I, each a Delaware corporation that is directly or indirectly owned by the company (the subsidiary guarantors).
The 2027 Notes and the related guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior debt of the company and its subsidiary guarantors and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of the company and its subsidiary guarantors. The 2027 Notes and the related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including preferred stock, trade payables and pension liabilities) of the subsidiaries of the company that are not subsidiary guarantors. The 2027 Notes and the guarantees will be secured by liens on substantially all assets of the company and the subsidiary guarantors, other than certain excluded assets (the collateral). The liens securing the 2027 Notes on certain ABL collateral will be subordinated to the liens on ABL collateral in favor of the ABL secured parties and, in the future, the liens securing the 2027 Notes may be subordinated to liens on the collateral securing certain permitted first lien debt, subject to certain limitations and permitted liens.
The company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2027 Notes at any time on or after November 1, 2020 at a redemption price determined in accordance with the redemption schedule set forth in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
Prior to November 1, 2023 the company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2027 Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes redeemed plus a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The company may also redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the 2027 Notes at any time prior to November 1, 2023, using the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 106.875% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. On or after November 1, 2023, the company may, on any one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the 2027 Notes at specified redemption premiums, declining to par for any redemptions on or after November 1, 2025.
The indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem its capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; (iv) make certain prepayments in respect of pension obligations; (v) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (vi) make loans and investments (including investments by the company and subsidiary guarantors in subsidiaries that are not guarantors); (vii) sell assets; (viii) create or incur liens; (ix) enter into transactions with affiliates; (x) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (xi) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. These covenants are subject to several important limitations and exceptions.
If the company experiences certain kinds of changes of control (as defined in the indenture), it will be required to offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes at 101% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the repurchase date, if any. In addition, if the company sells assets under certain circumstances it must apply the proceeds towards an offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes at a price equal to par plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding 2027 Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Contemporaneously with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, the company and the subsidiary guarantors entered into an amendment and restatement of the company’s secured revolving credit facility (the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility) that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $145.0 million (with a limit on letters of credit of $40.0 million), with an accordion feature provision allowing for an increase in credit facility up to $175.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility. The amendment and restatement extended the maturity from October 2022 to October 29, 2025 and modified certain other terms and covenants. Availability under the credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to the company’s receivables. At December 31, 2020, the company had no borrowings and $5.7 million of letters of credit outstanding, and availability under the facility was $112.9 million net of letters of credit issued.
The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility is subject to a springing maturity, under which the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility will immediately mature 91 days prior to any date on which contributions to pension funds in the United States in an amount in excess of $100.0 million are required to be paid unless the company is able to meet certain conditions, including that the company has the liquidity (as defined in the Amended and Restarted ABL Credit Facility) to cash settle the amount of such pension payments, no default or event of default has occurred under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility, the company’s liquidity is above $130.0 million and the company is in compliance with the then applicable fixed charge coverage ratio on a pro forma basis.
The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility is guaranteed by the subsidiary guarantors and any future material domestic subsidiaries. The facility is secured by the assets of the company and the subsidiary guarantors, other than certain excluded assets, under a security agreement entered into by the company and the subsidiary guarantors in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent for the lenders under the credit facility.
The company is required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if the availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility falls below the greater of 10% of the lenders’ commitments under the facility and $14.5 million.
The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, including, but not limited to, that there has been no material adverse change in the company’s business, properties, operations or financial condition. The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility includes restrictions on the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur other debt or liens, dispose of assets and make acquisitions, loans and investments, repurchase its equity, and prepay other debt. These restrictions are subject to several important limitations and exceptions. Events of default include non-payment, failure to comply with covenants, materially incorrect representations and warranties, change of control and default under other debt aggregating at least $50.0 million, subject to relevant cure periods, as applicable.
On November 25, 2020, the company gave notice to the holders of its 2021 Notes that it had elected to satisfy its conversion obligation in respect of such conversion by the combination settlement method, whereby the company shall pay and deliver to the converting holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes being converted a settlement amount equal to the sum of $1,000 plus shares of the company’s common stock. Assuming that all of the holders of the 2021 Notes convert their 2021 Notes into shares of the company’s common stock, in March of 2021, the company will deliver to the note holders $84.2 million of cash and approximately 4.6 million shares of the company’s common stock. The company estimates that it will receive approximately 1.2 million shares upon exercise of the capped call transactions; therefore, the number of outstanding shares of common stock will increase by approximately 3.4 million shares.
At December 31, 2020, the company has met all covenants and conditions under its various lending and funding agreements. The company expects to continue to meet these covenants and conditions through at least the next twelve months.
At December 31, 2020, the company had outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds totaling approximately $191 million related to performance and payment guarantees. On the basis of experience with these arrangements, the company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material.
As described more fully in Note 4, “Cost-reduction actions,” Note 5, “Leases and commitments” and Note 15, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2020, the company had certain cash obligations, which are due as follows:
As described in Note 17, “Employee plans,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2021, the company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $250.6 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans, which are comprised of a voluntary contribution of $200.0 million for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and $50.6 million primarily for international defined benefit pension plans.
In January of 2021, the company signed an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a group annuity contract for $279 million to transfer projected benefit obligations related to approximately 11,600 retirees of the company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. This action is expected to result in a first quarter 2021 one-time, non-cash, pre-tax settlement charge of approximately $158 million.
In late February or early March of 2021, the company’s Swiss subsidiary is expected to complete the transfer of its defined benefit pension plan to a multi-employer collective foundation. This is expected to result in removing the projected benefit obligations related to retirees under the Swiss plan, valued at approximately $100 million, from the company’s balance sheet. The transfer requires a one-time additional contribution of approximately $10 million to the Swiss plan. This action is expected to result in a first quarter 2021 one-time, non-cash, pre-tax settlement charge of approximately $29 million.
In late March 2021, the company expects its Netherlands subsidiary to complete the transfer of its defined benefit pension plan from a single-client circle to a multi-client circle within a multi-employer general pension fund. This will result in removing the plan’s projected benefit obligations and assets, valued at approximately $550 million and $620 million, respectively, from
the company’s balance sheet. This action is expected to result in a first quarter 2021 one-time, non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of approximately $186 million.
In January 2021, the company decided to make a number of changes to its organizational structure to more effectively address evolving client needs. With these changes, the company revised its reportable segments, but this did not impact the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020. The company’s reportable segments will be as follows: Digital Workplace Services, which will provide services and IP-led solutions that support clients’ employees’ productivity, satisfaction and ability to securely work anywhere, any time; Cloud & Infrastructure, which will provide hybrid and multi-cloud solutions in select markets to accelerate innovation and increase efficiency of our clients’ businesses; ClearPath Forward®, which will provide server systems and operating system software and services that are secure, innovative, and reliable for mission-critical processing; and Other, which is principally comprised of business processing outsourcing (BPO) solutions, which will provide management of critical processes and functions for clients in select industries, helping them improve performance and reduce costs. These changes will be reflected prospectively, with comparable prior period data, in the company’s first quarter 2021 Form 10-Q.
The company maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which expires in June of 2021, that covers the offer and sale of up to $700.0 million of debt or equity securities. The company expects to replace the current shelf registration statement before it expires with a new shelf registration statement. Subject to the company’s ongoing compliance with securities laws, the company may offer and sell debt and equity securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement. In addition, from time to time the company has explored, and expects to continue to explore, a variety of debt and equity sources to fund its liquidity and capital needs.
The company may, from time to time, redeem, tender for, or repurchase its securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon availability, market conditions and other factors.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain accounting policies, methods and estimates are particularly important because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management’s current judgments. The company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances; however, to the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual results, the financial statements will be affected. Although there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates affecting the company’s financial statements as described in Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates, judgments and assumptions. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.
Revenue recognition
Many of the company’s sales agreements contain standard business terms and conditions; however, some agreements contain
multiple performance obligations or non-standard terms and conditions. As discussed in Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the company enters into arrangements, which may include any combination of hardware, software or services. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the performance obligations specified in an arrangement should be treated as separate performance obligations for revenue recognition purposes, and when to recognize revenue for each performance obligation.
Revenue and profit under systems integration contracts are recognized over time as the company transfers control of goods or services. The company measures its progress toward satisfaction of its performance obligations using the cost-to-cost method, or when services have been performed, depending on the nature of the project.
For contracts accounted for using the cost-to-cost method, revenue and profit recognized in any given accounting period are based on estimates of total projected contract costs. The estimates are continually reevaluated and revised, when necessary, throughout the life of a contract. The company follows this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made. The financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts and therefore, recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Accordingly, favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue and profit recognition, and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and profit. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract upon completion, a provision for the expected loss is recorded in the period in
which the loss becomes evident. As work progresses under a loss contract, revenue continues to be recognized, and a portion of the contract costs incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve.
Income Taxes
Accounting rules governing income taxes require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. These rules also require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of $1,380.8 million and $1,617.8 million, respectively. For the reasons cited below, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, management determined that it is more likely than not that $109.3 million and $93.1 million, respectively, of such assets will be realized, resulting in a valuation allowance of $1,271.5 million and $1,524.7 million, respectively.
The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company’s historical profitability, forecast of future taxable income and available tax-planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. The company uses tax-planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect the company’s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, the following: increased competition, a decline in sales or margins, loss of market share, delays in product availability or technological obsolescence. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 provide annual limitations with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its net operating loss (as well as certain built-in losses) and tax credit carryforwards, respectively (Tax Attributes), against future U.S. taxable income, if the corporation experiences an “ownership change.” In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. The company regularly monitors ownership changes (as calculated for purposes of Section 382). The company has determined that, for purposes of the rules of Section 382 described above, an ownership change occurred in February 2011. Any future transaction or transactions and the timing of such transaction or transactions could trigger additional ownership changes under Section 382.
As a result of the February 2011 ownership change, utilization for certain of the company’s Tax Attributes, U.S. net operating losses and tax credits, is subject to an overall annual limitation of $70.6 million. The cumulative limitation as of December 31, 2020 is approximately $346.1 million. This limitation will be applied to any net operating losses and then to any other Tax Attributes. Any unused limitation may be carried over to later years. Based on presently available information and the existence of tax planning strategies, the company does not expect to incur a U.S. cash tax liability in the near term. The company maintains a full valuation allowance against the realization of all U.S. deferred tax assets as well as certain foreign deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. See Note 7, “Income taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The company’s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time. The company operates within federal, state and international taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. As a result, the actual income tax liabilities in the jurisdictions with respect to any fiscal year are ultimately determined long after the financial statements have been published.
Pensions
Accounting rules governing defined benefit pension plans require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. The measurement of the company’s pension obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions selected by the company and used by the company’s actuaries. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as demographic experience. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates, retirement rates, inflation, expected return on plan assets and mortality rates.
As permitted for purposes of computing pension expense, the company uses a calculated value of plan assets (which is further described below). This allows the effects of the performance of the pension plan’s assets on the company’s computation of pension income or expense to be amortized over future periods. A substantial portion of the company’s pension plan assets relates to its qualified defined benefit plans in the United States.
Funding requirements for its U.S. qualified pension plans are calculated by the plan’s actuaries based on certain assumptions including, as permitted under the Bi-partisan Budget Act of 2015, a discount rate constrained to be within 10% of the 25-year average of the relevant rates. The effect of this limitation is that the funding discount rate is higher than the GAAP discount rate applied for balance sheet purposes, and the liability is therefore lower. In addition, this constraint mitigates the effect of changes
in market interest rates on the funding discount rate and the funding liability. Changes to the benefit obligation caused by a 25 basis point change noted above are related to the balance sheet obligation and are not necessarily indicative of the impact on the funding liability.
A significant element in determining the company’s pension income or expense is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The company sets the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term return of the various asset categories in which it invests. The company considers the current expectations for future returns and the actual historical returns of each asset class. Also, because the company’s investment policy is to actively manage certain asset classes where the potential exists to outperform the broader market, the expected returns for those asset classes are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns. For 2021, the company has assumed that the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets will be 6.07%, and on the company’s non-U.S. plan assets will be 3.30%. A change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return for the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans causes a change of approximately $9 million and $5 million, respectively, in 2021 pension expense. The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years. This produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income or expense. At December 31, 2020, for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, the calculated value of plan assets was $3.85 billion and the fair value was $3.71 billion.
At the end of each year, the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities. Inherent in deriving the discount rate are significant assumptions with respect to the timing and magnitude of expected benefit payment obligations. The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the company looks to rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that (a) receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency and (b) are currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. At December 31, 2020, the company determined this rate to be 2.85% for its U.S. defined benefit pension plans, a decrease of 68 basis points from the rate used at December 31, 2019, and 1.23% for the company’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, a decrease of 59 basis points from the rate used at December 31, 2019. A change of 25 basis points in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates causes a change in 2021 pension expense of approximately $2 million and $100 thousand, respectively, and a change of approximately $107 million and $137 million, respectively, in the benefit obligation. These estimates are intended to be illustrative based on a single 25 basis point change. The sensitivity to rate changes is not linear and additional changes in rates may result in a different impact on the pension liability. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, has been deferred, as permitted.
Gains and losses are defined as changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions. Because gains and losses may reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another and vice versa, the accounting rules do not require recognition of gains and losses as components of net pension cost of the period in which they arise.
At a minimum, amortization of an unrecognized net gain or loss must be included as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the calculated value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amortization is that excess above the 10 percent divided by the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. For the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the company’s non-U.S. pension plans, that period is approximately 16 and 23 years, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the estimated unrecognized loss for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the company’s non-U.S. pension plans was $2.35 billion and $1.13 billion, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recognized consolidated pension expense of $235.3 million, compared with $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For 2021, the company expects to recognize pension expense of approximately $418.6 million, which includes estimated settlement charges of $373 million related to plans in the Netherlands, the United States and Switzerland of $186 million, $158 million and $29 million, respectively. See Note 17, “Employee plans,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill
Accounting rules governing goodwill require a company test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When determining the fair value of a reporting unit, as appropriate for the individual reporting unit, the company uses both an income and market approach. The methodology used to determine the fair values using the income and market approaches, as described below, are weighted to determine the fair value for each reporting unit.
The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, the method used is the discounted cash flow method. The company starts with a forecast of all expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then a reporting unit-specific discount rate is applied to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of projected net cash flows, long-term growth rate and the discount rate. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of economic and market conditions, which drive key assumptions of revenue growth rates and operating margins. The discount rate in turn is based on various market factors and specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit.
The market approach relies primarily on external information for estimating the fair value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the selected performance metric used in this approach.
Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments about key assumptions. There are a number of factors including potential events and changes in circumstances that could change in future periods, including: projected operating results; valuation multiples exhibited by the company and by companies considered comparable to the reporting units; and other macro-economic factors that could impact the discount rate. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
Goodwill by reporting unit at December 31, 2020, was as follows (dollars in millions):
As a result of the impairment review, the company concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2020, and does not believe that any of its reporting units are at risk of failing the impairment test since all reporting unit fair values were substantially in excess of carrying value as of the last impairment test.
