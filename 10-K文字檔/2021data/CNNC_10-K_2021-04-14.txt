Each product has an unconditional 30-day warranty, during which time the product can be returned for a complete refund. Customers can purchase extended warranties, which provide for replacement or repair of the unit beyond the period provided by the unconditional warranty. Warranties can be purchased for various periods but generally they are for one-year period that begins after any other warranties expire. The revenue from warranties is recognized on a straight-line bases over the period covered by the warranty. Prior to the issuance of financial statements management reviews any returns subsequent to the end of the accounting period which are from sales recognized during the accounting period and makes appropriate adjustments as necessary. Product prices are fixed or determinable and products are only shipped when collectability is reasonably assured.
Stock Based Compensation

Stock based compensation cost for stock options granted to employees, board members and service providers is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model. The value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
