ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Dollar amounts presented are in thousands, except per share data or where the context otherwise requires.
Overview
We are a provider of professional and technical engineering and consulting solutions to public and private sector clients. We focus on the infrastructure, utility services, construction, real estate, and environmental markets. We primarily focus on the following business service verticals: testing, inspection & consulting, infrastructure support services, utility services, buildings & program management, environmental health sciences, and geospatial technology services. Our primary clients include U.S. federal, state, municipal, and local government agencies, and military and defense clients. We also serve quasi-public and private sector clients from the education, healthcare, utility services, and public utilities, including schools, universities, hospitals, health care providers, insurance providers, large utility service providers, and large to small utility service producers.
Although we anticipate public and quasi-public sector clients will represent the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future, we intend to continue expanding our service offerings to private sector clients. Historically, public and quasi-public sector clients have demonstrated greater resilience during periods of economic downturns, while private sector clients have offered higher gross profit margin opportunities during periods of economic expansion.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a "52/53 week" fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31st (whether or not in the following calendar year), with interim calendar quarters ending on the Saturday closest to the end of such calendar quarter (whether or not in the following calendar quarter). As a result, fiscal 2020 included 53 weeks compared to fiscal 2019 and 2018, which both included 52 weeks.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our critical accounting estimates are those we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our critical accounting estimates, the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows:
Revenue Recognition
On the first day of fiscal year 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), using the modified retrospective approach to all contracts that were not completed as of the beginning of fiscal year 2018. Topic 606 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Topic 606 became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Adoption of Topic 606 did not have an impact on our consolidated net income, financial position, and cash flows; however, it has resulted in expanded disclosures. Revenue from the vast majority of our contracts will continue to be recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The impact to revenues from adopting Topic 606 for the period ended December 29, 2018 was not material.
To determine the proper revenue recognition method, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services that is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct.
Our performance obligations are satisfied as work progresses or at a point in time. Gross revenues from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 92%, 90%, and 92% of our revenues during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018,
respectively. For our cost-reimbursable contracts, revenue is recognized over time using direct costs incurred or direct costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total direct costs for performance obligations because it depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on its contracts. Contract costs include labor, sub-consultant services, and other direct costs. Gross revenue from services transferred to customers at a point in time accounted for 8%, 10%, and 8% of our revenues during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the reports and/or analysis performed.
Contract modifications are common in the performance of our contracts. Contracts modified typically result from changes in scope, specifications, design, performance, sites, or period of completion. In most cases, contract modifications are for services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.
Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions are dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates, including engineering progress, achievement of milestones, labor productivity and cost estimates. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates. If estimated total costs on contracts indicate a loss or reduction to the percentage of total contract revenues recognized to date, these losses or reductions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are known. The effect of revisions to revenues, estimated costs to complete contracts, including penalties, incentive awards, change orders, claims, anticipated losses and others are recorded on the cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are identified and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects on the results of operations for that reporting period may be material depending on the size of the project or the adjustment. During fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 the cumulative catch-up adjustment for contract modifications was not material.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We record billed and unbilled receivables net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is estimated based on management’s evaluation of the contracts involved and the financial condition of clients. Factors considered include:
•Client type (governmental or private client)
•Historical performance
•Historical collection trends
•General economic conditions
The allowance is increased by our provision for doubtful accounts, which is charged against income. All recoveries on receivables previously charged off are credited to the accounts receivable recovery account and are included in income, while direct charge-offs of receivables are deducted from the allowance. Although we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient, a decline in economic conditions could lead to the deterioration in the financial condition of our customers, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, and additional allowances may be required that could materially impact our consolidated results of operations. Trade receivable balances carried by us are comprised of accounts from a diverse client base across a broad range of industries.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is the excess of consideration paid for an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired, including other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. To determine the amount of goodwill resulting from a business combination, we perform an assessment to determine the acquisition date fair value of the acquired company’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities.
We evaluate goodwill annually for impairment on August 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired, using the quantitative method. An entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These qualitative factors include: macroeconomic and industry conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If the entity determines that this threshold is met, then we may apply a one-step quantitative impairment test. The one-step impairment test requires a comparison of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with a reporting unit, including goodwill, with the fair value of the reporting unit. We determine fair value through multiple valuation techniques, and weight the results accordingly. We make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, we would record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
On August 1, 2020, we conducted our annual impairment tests using the quantitative method of evaluating goodwill. Based on the quantitative analyses, we determined the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore, there was no goodwill impairment. There were no indicators, events or changes in circumstances that would indicate goodwill impairment for the period from August 2, 2020 through January 2, 2021.
Identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer backlog, customer relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements, and developed technology. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. If an indicator of impairment exists we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then impairment, if any, is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. There were no indicators, events or changes in circumstances that would indicate intangible assets were impaired during fiscal 2020.
In conjunction with an acquisition of a business, we record identifiable intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, and customer retention rates. We use an independent valuation specialist to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value calculated for intangible assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation due to the estimates and assumptions used in determining their fair value. As a result, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized. During 2020, we finalized the QSI purchase price allocation reported at December 28, 2019 to account for updates to assumptions and estimates related to the fair value of the trade name, customer relationships, and customer backlog. As a result, we determined the QSI trade name is a finite-lived asset that will be amortized over a two-year period and the fair value was decreased by $54,313. Additionally, the fair value of QSI's customer relationships and customer backlog increased $6,605 and $811, respectively.
Recent Acquisitions
The aggregate value of all consideration for our acquisitions consummated during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $1,949, $369,879, and $95,450, respectively. The net assets acquired during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $1,511, $166,637 and $51,705, respectively, while the gross revenues associated with these acquisitions (from their respective dates of acquisition) were $851, $42,127 and $33,468, respectively.
2020 Acquisitions
On July 16, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Mediatech FZ, LLC and Mediatech Information Technology Consultants ("Mediatech"), a technology company providing security, enterprise IT, and building technology solutions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and South East Asia.

The final determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities will be completed within the one-year measurement period as required by ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). The Mediatech acquisition will necessitate the use of this measurement period to adequately analyze and assess the factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date, including intangible assets, accounts receivable, and certain fixed assets.

We did not receive any proceeds associated with the sale of the 2018 Option Shares by the selling stockholder.
Segments
Effective the beginning of fiscal year 2020, we re-evaluated the structure of our internal organization structure as a result of the 2019 acquisition of QSI. To reflect management's revised perspective, we are now organized into three operating and reportable segments:
•Infrastructure ("INF") - includes our engineering, civil program management, utility services, and construction quality assurance, testing and inspection practices;
•Building, Technology & Sciences ("BTS") - includes our environmental health sciences, buildings and program management, and MEP & technology engineering practices; and
•Geospatial Solutions ("GEO") - includes our geospatial technology services practice.
The GEO segment has been created in order to provide greater visibility regarding the operational and financial performance of QSI. The GEO segment structure is consistent with how we plan and allocate resources, manage our business, and assess our performance. The change in our segment reporting was not material to prior period segment financial results. As
such, prior period segment financial results were not retrospectively revised. The assets of QSI were reallocated from our INF reportable segment to our new GEO reportable segment.
For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 18, Reportable Segments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global stock markets and economies. We are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our customers and employees. Some of our services were affected, primarily our real estate transactional services and hospitality-related services. In particular, due to COVID-19 restrictions, some of our casino and hotel projects have been delayed. As U.S. and international economies begin to reopen and with a vaccine underway we expect demand for these services to return, but we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact. We intend to continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business closely.
Components of Income and Expense
Revenues
We enter into contracts with our clients that contain two principal types of pricing provisions, representing a percentage of total revenue as shown below:
Cost-reimbursable contracts. Cost-reimbursable contracts consist of the following:
•Time and materials contracts are common for smaller scale professional and technical consulting and certification services projects. Under these types of contracts, there is no predetermined fee. Instead, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based upon actual hours expended on a project. In addition, any direct project expenditures are passed through to the client and are typically reimbursed. These contracts may have an initial not-to-exceed or guaranteed maximum price provision.
•Cost-plus contracts are the predominant contracting method used by U.S. federal, state, and local governments. Under these type contracts, we charge clients for its costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a negotiated fee. The total estimated cost plus the negotiated fee represents the total contract value.
•Lump-sum contracts typically require the performance of all of the work under the contract for a specified lump-sum fee, subject to price adjustments if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen conditions arise. Many of our lump-sum contracts are negotiated and arise in the design of projects with a specified scope and project deliverables. In most cases, we can bill additional fees if the construction schedule is modified and lengthened.
Fixed-unit price contracts. Fixed-unit price contracts consist of the following:
•Fixed-unit price contracts typically require the performance of an estimated number of units of work at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units performed.
Revenues from engineering services are recognized in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues under cost-reimbursable contracts are recognized when services are performed or on the percentage-of-completion method. Revenues recognized on the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured by the direct costs incurred to date as compared to estimated costs incurred and represents approximately 45%, 31%, and 22% of revenues recognized during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenues from fixed-unit price contracts are recognized at a point in time.
Direct Costs of Revenues
Direct costs of revenues consist of the following in connection with fee generating projects:
•Technical and non-technical salaries and wages
•Production expenses, including depreciation
•Sub-consultant services
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are expensed as incurred and include the following:
•Marketing expenses
•Management and administrative personnel costs
•Payroll taxes, bonuses and employee benefits
•Portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of revenues
•Facility costs
•Depreciation and amortization
•Professional services, legal and accounting fees, and administrative operating costs
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Consolidated Results of Operations
The following table represents our condensed results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
Fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended December 28, 2019
Gross Revenues
Our consolidated gross revenues increased by $150,358, or 30% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in gross revenue was primarily due to incremental gross revenues from QSI of $145,047, incremental gross revenues from other acquisitions completed since the beginning of 2019 of $33,329, and an increase in our infrastructure support services of $2,542. The increase in our infrastructure support services was primarily due to increases in our power delivery services of $9,358, partially offset by decreases in our northeast infrastructure services of $4,447 and a decrease in our liquefied natural gas business $876. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our real estate transactional services and hospitality-related services of $13,439, decreases from our mechanical, electric, and plumbing (MEP) services of $6,741, decreases in our radiation & occupational safety program of $3,696, and a decrease in our pipeline inspection services of $3,099, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross Profit
As a percentage of gross revenues, our gross profit margin was 50.7% and 48.2% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to a change in our mix of business resulting from the QSI acquisition. As a percentage of gross revenues, direct salaries and wages decreased 3.2%, primarily as a result of our mix of work performed. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sub-consultant services as a percentage of gross revenues of 0.7%, primarily as a result of our mix of work performed. Other direct costs remained flat year-over-year as a percentage of gross revenues.
Operating expenses
Our operating expenses increased $76,214, or 36% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in operating expenses primarily resulted from increased payroll and performance-based compensation costs of $48,258, including stock-based compensation of $14,955 during 2020 compared to $10,430 in 2019, increased general and administrative costs of $7,558, an increase in facilities and facilities related expense of $4,135, an increase in intangible asset amortization expense of $14,108, and an increase in depreciation expense of $2,156, primarily as a result of our acquisitions.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense increased $12,906 in fiscal 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from the increased level of indebtedness associated with the QSI acquisition.
Income taxes
Our consolidated effective income tax rate was 27.4% and 17.8% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based payments in 2020 as compared to 2019. See Note 17, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail of income tax expense.
Net income
Our net income decreased $2,738, or 12% compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the increase in our amortization expense driven by our 2019 acquisitions. Our gross profit increased $89,156 primarily due to our 2019 acquisitions. This increase was offset by increases in payroll and performance-based compensation costs of $48,258, general and administrative costs of $7,558, facilities and facilities related expense of $4,135, intangible asset amortization expense of $14,108, depreciation expense of $5,565, and interest expense of $12,906, which were also driven by acquisitions.
For comparison of 2019 to 2018, see "Results of Operations - Consolidated Results of Operations" under Item 7 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020, which discussion is expressly incorporated herein by reference thereto.
Segment Results of Operations
The following tables set forth summarize financial information concerning our reportable segments (dollars in thousands):
For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 18, Reportable Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended December 28, 2019
INF Segment.
Our gross revenues from INF increased $21,804, or 7%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in gross revenues was primarily due to incremental revenue of $27,964 from acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal 2019 and increases in our infrastructure support services of $2,542. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our pipeline inspection services of $3,099.
Segment Income before Taxes from INF increased $7,991, or 15%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to incremental gross revenues from acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal 2019.
BTS Segment.
Our gross revenues from BTS decreased $20,345, or 11%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in gross revenues was primarily due to decreases in our real estate transactional services and hospitality-related services of $13,439, decreases in our MEP services of $6,741, and decreases in our radiation & occupational safety program of $3,696 primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by incremental gross revenues of $5,365 from acquisitions completed since the beginning of 2019.
Segment Income before Taxes from BTS decreased $7,047, or 25%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was due to lower gross revenues primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
GEO Segment.
Our gross revenues from GEO was $148,899 in 2020. Gross revenues were primarily derived from public and quasi-public sector clients, which contributed $101,456 of gross revenues. Private sector clients contributed gross revenues of $47,443 in 2020.
Segment Income before Taxes from GEO was $30,013 in 2020.
For comparison of 2019 to 2018, see "Results of Operations - Segment Results of Operations" under Item 7 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020, which discussion is expressly incorporated herein by reference thereto.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Facility, and access to financial markets. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, repayment of debt, and acquisition expenditures. We believe our sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We will monitor our capital requirements thereafter to ensure our needs are in line with available capital resources.
Operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $96,009 in 2020 compared to $39,900 in 2019. The increase was a result of the growth in our revenues primarily driven by our acquisitions and changes in our working capital. The changes in our working capital primarily resulted from increased advanced billings of $25,981 primarily related to liquefied natural gas projects, increased accrued liabilities and accounts payable of $5,283 related to timing of payments, and a decrease of $8,279 in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily as a result of decreased prepaid insurance of $4,372, decreased prepaid income taxes of $2,342, and a decrease in other receivables of $2,298. These increases were partially offset by $4,929 as a result of increased billed and unbilled receivables primarily related to our growth in revenues during 2020.
Investing activities
During 2020 and 2019, net cash used in investing activities totaled $9,067 and $351,000, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of decreased acquisition activity, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2020 of $7,230. The increase in purchases of property and equipment was primarily a result of the acquisition of QSI which typically requires proportionally larger amounts of capital expenditures than our other businesses.
Financing activities
Cash flows used in financing activities in 2020 was $53,858 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $302,186 in 2019. The change was primarily due to decreased borrowings from our Senior Credit Facility in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, we borrowed $330,457 from our Senior Credit Facility primarily to fund the December 2019 QSI acquisition. As a result, we had an increase of $26,625 in principal payments related to our Senior Credit Facility in 2020 compared to 2019.
For comparison of 2019 to 2018 cash flows, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows” under Item 7 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020, which discussions are expressly incorporated herein by reference thereto.
Financing
Senior Credit Facility
On December 20, 2019 (the "Closing Date"), we amended and restated our Credit Agreement (the "A&R Credit Agreement"), dated December 7, 2016, as amended on December 20, 2018, with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), as administrative agent, swingline lender and letter of credit issuer, the other lenders party thereto, and certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors. Pursuant to the A&R Credit Agreement, the lenders provided term commitments of $150,000 in the aggregate in a single draw on the Closing Date to fund the acquisition of QSI and various costs and expenses relating thereto and revolving commitments totaling $215,000 in the aggregate. The revolving commitment is available through December 20, 2024 (the "Maturity Date"), at which time the term commitments and revolving commitments will be due and payable in full. An aggregate amount of $320,500 was drawn under the A&R Credit Agreement on the Closing Date to fund the QSI acquisition and repay previously existing borrowings. Borrowings under the A&R Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets. The A&R Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature permitting us to request an increase in either the term facility or the revolver facility under the A&R Credit Agreement by an additional amount of up to $100,000 in the aggregate.
Borrowings under the term facility amortize at the rate of 5.0% per annum for the first two years of the facility and thereafter at the rate of 7.5% per annum until the Maturity Date.
On May 5, 2020 (the "Amendment Closing Date"), in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we entered into an amendment to the A&R Credit Agreement (the "Amended A&R Credit Agreement") to amend the financial covenants that requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of the our pro forma consolidated funded indebtedness to our pro forma consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed measurement period). The amended consolidated leverage ratio requirements are as follows:
These financial covenants also require us to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.20 to 1.00 as of the end of any measurement period. As of January 2, 2021, we were in compliance with the financial covenants.
The Amended A&R Credit Agreement also amended pricing terms which remain variable and tied to a Eurocurrency rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus an applicable margin or a base rate denominated in U.S. dollars. Interest rates remain subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of January 2, 2021, our interest rate was 2.8%.
The Amended A&R Credit Agreement contains covenants that may have the effect of limiting our ability to, among other things, merge with or acquire other entities, enter into a transaction resulting in a Change in Control, create certain new liens, incur certain additional indebtedness, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, or engage in new lines of business or sell a substantial part of their assets. The Amended A&R Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including (but not limited to) a default in the payment of principal or, following an applicable grace period, interest, breaches of our covenants or warranties under the Amended A&R Credit Agreement, payment default or acceleration of certain indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, certain judgments or uninsured losses, changes in control and certain liabilities related to ERISA based plans.
The Amended A&R Credit Agreement limits the payment of cash dividends (together with certain other payments that would constitute a "Restricted Payment" within the meaning of the Amended A&R Credit Agreement and generally including dividends, stock repurchases and certain other payments in respect to warrants, options, and other rights to acquire equity securities) to no more than $10,000 in any fiscal year, so long as no default shall exist at the time of or arise as a result from such payment.
Total debt issuance costs incurred and capitalized in connection with the issuance of the Amended A&R Credit Agreement were $4,123. Total amortization of debt issuance costs was $896 and $131 during 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2021 (in thousands):
(1) Interest consists of remaining interest payments on our term loan. The amount of interest calculated for purposes of this table were based upon rates as of January 2, 2021.
(2) Other long-term liabilities consist of payroll tax deferrals associated with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act"), which we expect to be paid in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.
Our accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet include unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 2, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $1,022. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlements in individual years in connection with unrecognized tax benefit; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above table.
