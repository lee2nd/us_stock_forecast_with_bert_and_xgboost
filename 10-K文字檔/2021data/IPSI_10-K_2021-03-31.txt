Overview and Financial Condition
Recent Developments
The February 2021 Private Placement
On February 16, 2021, we received net proceeds of $1,788,500 after an original issue discount of $255,500 upon our issuance of Senior Secured Convertible Notes in the principal amount of $2,044,000, bearing interest at 10% per annum and maturing on February 16, 2022. The notes are convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of 0.23 per share. In addition, we issued warrants exercisable for 8,886,958 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.24 per share. We used $459,033 of the proceeds to repay Senior Secured Convertible Notes which were convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.045 per share. In connection with the issuance of the notes and warrants , we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated February 16, 2021 with several of the investors pursuant to which we are obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC within ninety (90) days after the date of the agreement to register the resale by of the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable under the Note and upon exercise of the Warrant that was issued to the investor, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within one hundred five (105) days after the registration statement is filed. Each note holder has contractually agreed to restrict its ability to convert the notes or exercise the Warrants such that the number of shares of the Company’s common stock held by the holder and its affiliates after such exercise does not exceed the beneficial ownership limitation set forth in the notes and warrants which may not exceed initially 4.99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
Warrant Exercises
Between February 18, 2021 and March 9, 2021 warrants for 44,074,285 shares were exercised by investors at an exercise price of $0.05 per share, for gross proceeds of $2,203,714.
The March 2021 Private Placement
On March 17, 2021, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (the “SPAs”) with several institutional investors, pursuant to which we sold to the Investors in a private placement (i) 30,333,334 shares of our common stock (the “Shares”) and (ii) warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 15,166,667 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4,550,000. The combined purchase price for one share of common stock and associated Warrant was $0.15.
We intend to use the net proceeds primarily for development of our technology, digital payment platform and marketing, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.
The Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $0.15 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Warrants for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events. The Investors may exercise the Warrants on a cashless basis if after the six month anniversary of date of issuance the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants (the “Warrant Shares”) are not then registered pursuant to an effective registration statement. Each Investor has contractually agreed to restrict its ability to exercise the Warrants such that the number of shares of the Company’s common stock held by the Investor and its affiliates after such exercise does not exceed the beneficial ownership limitation set forth in the Warrants which may not exceed initially 4.99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
In connection with the SPAs, the Company entered into Registration Rights Agreements (“RRAs”), dated March 11, 2021, with each of the Investors pursuant to which the Company is obligated to file a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to register for resale the Shares and Warrant Shares within twenty days following the date upon which the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC within sixty days after the Registration Statement is filed (or, in the event of a “full review” by the SEC, within seventy five days after the Registration Statement is filed). The Company will be obligated to pay certain liquidated damages to the investors if the Company fails to file the resale registration statement when required, fails to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC when required, of if the Company fails to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
The SPAs and the RRAs contain customary representations, warranties, conditions and indemnification obligations of the parties, which were made only for purposes of such SPAs and RRAs as of specific dates and solely for the benefit of the parties. The SPAs and RRAs may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties.
Pursuant to an engagement letter (the “Engagement Letter”), dated as of March 6, 2021, by and between us and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“Wainwright”), we engaged Wainwright to act as our exclusive placement agent in connection with the private placement. Pursuant to the engagement agreement, we agreed paid Wainwright a cash fee of 8.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the private placement. We also paid Wainwright (i) a management fee equal to 1.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the private placement; (ii) $35,000 for non-accountable expenses and (iii) $50,000 for fees and expenses of legal counsel and other out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, we issued to Wainwright (or its designees) placement agent warrants (the “Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase a number of shares equal to 8.0% of the aggregate number of Shares sold under the Purchase Agreement or warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 2,426,667 shares of our common stock. The Placement Agent Warrants generally have the same terms as the Warrants, except they will have an exercise price of $0.1875.
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, of Innovative Payment Solutions, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions. The estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Results of Operations for the years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Net revenue
We have treated our Mexican operations as a discontinued operation in these financial statements, we have not generated any revenues from our US operations to date. We anticipate that we will recommence generating revenue once we are able to install our kiosks, the timing of which is uncertain due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cost of goods sold
We have treated our Mexican operations as a discontinued operation in these financial statements we have not generated any cost of goods sold from our US operations to date. We anticipate that our cost of goods sold will increase once we are able to install our kiosks.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $1,742,008 and $807,934 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $934,074 or 115.6%. The increase is primarily due to payments to our senior management as consulting fees and salaries and wages which increased by $317,295 over the prior year, primarily due to the appointment of our new CEO during the prior year; the issuance of restricted stock to our CEO with a related expense of $502,128, directors fees of $88,000 incurred during the current year, an increase in professional fees of $111,907 primarily fees paid to consultants to develop our IT framework for our US operations, an increase in legal fees of $60,232 due to the increased funding activity which took place during the current year, and a rental increase of $29,477 as we relocated to new premises during the current year; offset by a reduction in capital raising fees of $248,364 incurred in the prior year.
Depreciation
Depreciation was $12,500 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $12,500. Depreciation during the current period represents depreciation on the kiosks received from Qpagos Mexico.
Investment impairment charge
Investment impairment charge was $1,019,960 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the Company raised an impairment charge against the investment in Vivi Holdings Inc, as Vivi continues to not meet any of its indicated milestones concerning its proposed IPO and fund raising efforts.
Loss on settlement of liabilities
Loss on settlement of liabilities was $95,082 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $95,082. The loss on settlement of liabilities represents the settlement of certain promissory notes during the current period by the issuance of 1,692,764 shares of common stock at a discount to current market prices resulting in a loss on settlement of $50,082 and the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of common stock to a previous note holder in settlement of a dispute over the repayment of a convertible note during the current period, at the market value of the shares of $45,000, on the date of settlement.
Loss on debt conversion
Loss on debt conversion was $433,610 and $2,838,599 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $2,404,989 or 84.7%. The decrease in the loss on conversion of convertible debts was due to a higher value of debt converted to equity and debt exchanged for equity during the prior period, primarily to extinguish debt which had already matured. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $335,948 and $3,584,505, respectively, of principal and interest was converted into equity.
Debt extension fee
Debt extension fee was $40,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we incurred a debt extension fee of $40,000 on a convertible note which was maturing, this note has subsequently been repaid.
Penalty on convertible notes
Penalty on convertible notes was $0 and $191,757 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $191,757 or 100%. The Penalty on convertible notes arose due to certain convertible notes maturing before they could be repaid, resulting in a default whereby the principal sum of the note increased by percentages ranging from 10% to 50% of the capital outstanding.
Provision against receivables
A provision of $129,995 was raised against receivables from Qpagos Mexico relating to VAT refunds. These refunds have been outstanding for an extended period and collectability is uncertain based on the ageing of the refunds due.
Interest expense
Interest expense was $381,034 and $369,305 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $11,729 or 3.2%. The increase is primarily due to the penalty interest incurred on the cash settlement of convertible debt resulting in penalty interest of $238,080 offset by a reduction in interest expense due to the timing of new convertible debt taken out during the current year.
Amortization of debt discount
Amortization of debt discount was $1,065,879 and $1,692,101 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $626,222 or 37.0%. The decrease is primarily due to the timing of new convertible debt advanced during the third and fourth quarters of the current year.
Derivative liability movements
Derivative liability movements were $(654,471) and $1,981,938 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The derivative liability arose due to the issuance of convertible securities with variable conversion prices and no floor conversion price. The prior year derivative liability credit was primarily due to the conversion of $3,584,505 of debt during the prior year into equity, the current year charge represents the mark-to-market of the derivative liability outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Net loss from continuing operations
We incurred a net loss of $5,444,544 and $4,047,762 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively, an increase in loss of $1,396,782 or 34.5%, primarily due to the increase in general and administrative expenses, the investment impairment charge and the reduction in the derivative liability gain, offset by a reduction in loss on debt conversion and the amortization of debt discount as discussed above.
Loss from discontinued operations
Operating loss from discontinued operations, net of taxation was $0 and $653,246 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $653,246 or 100%. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in general and administrative expenses of $560,316 due to a concerted effort by management to reduce operating expenditure due to the loss-making nature of the business and an increase in foreign exchange gain of $276,103, primarily due to the disposal of the business effective December 31, 2019, resulting in a realization of the foreign currency translation adjustment.
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries was $0 and $971,903 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $971,903 or 100%. We disposed of our Mexican operation effective December 31, 2019, in exchange for shares in Vivi Holdings, Inc, valued at $1,120,836 using the market value method to determine the value of the business disposed of due to the lack of relevant financial information from Vivi Holdings, Inc. and other proceeds of $180,000. We incurred expenditure of $129,203 related to the disposal, including allocating Vivi Holdings, Inc shares to certain individuals who facilitated the transaction, valued at $100,875. The net asset value of the subsidiaries disposed of was $199,730, resulting in the net gain on disposal of $971,903.
Net loss
Net loss was $5,444,544 and $3,729,106 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase in loss of $1,715,438 or 46.0%. The increase is due to the increase in net loss from continuing operations offset by the increase in the gain from discontinued operations on the sale of our Mexican operations, discussed in detail above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised primarily from the sale of our debt and equity securities.
We incurred an accumulated deficit of $27,629,575 through December 31, 2020 and incurred negative cash flow from operations of $1,256,279 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The new direction of the Company into the US payment services market will require us to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development effort and we will be required to raise additional funding.
We will need to generate additional revenue from operations and/or obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, which includes expansion in the US market, repay our outstanding note obligations and take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. To meet our financing needs, we have, subsequent to year end, raised convertible debt funding of $1,788,500, received proceeds from warrant exercises of $2,203,714 and an additional gross proceeds $4,550,000 from a private placement of equity securities, we believe we have sufficient funding to implement our business strategy in the US market.
At December 31, 2020, we had cash of $94,703 and a negative working capital of $4,363,720, including a derivative liability of $2,966,416. Due to the proceeds raised on the convertible debt funding, warrant exercises and private equity placement, we believe we have sufficient funds to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. After eliminating the derivative liability our working capital deficit is $1,397,304. We believe that the current cash balances together with revenue anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs and as mentioned above. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic our ability to generate revenue has been significantly impacted and it is difficult to determine when we my start to generate revenue from operations.
We utilized cash of $1,256,979 and $493,641 from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and utilized cash of $0 and $281,215 from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall cash utilized in operations increased by $481,423.
We acquired terminals for gross proceeds of $50,000 from Qpagos Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2020, in terms of the SPA agreement entered into with Vivi Holdings in December 2019.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily comprised of $1,962,375 of proceeds from short term notes and convertible notes and to a lesser extent share issuances of $33,000 and proceeds from Federal relief funds of $210,292, which was offset by $807,664 in repayment of loans payable and repayment of convertible notes. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily comprised of $1,123,888 of proceeds from short term notes and convertible notes and proceeds from loans payable.
At March 17, 2021, we had outstanding notes in the principal amount of $2,044,000. The notes were issued on February 16, 2021 and may be prepaid at any time for the first 90 days in an amount equal to 115% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. From day 91 through day 180, the Notes may be prepaid in an amount equal to 120% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. From day 181 through day 365, it may be prepaid in an amount equal to 125% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The notes contain certain covenants, such as restrictions on: (i) distributions on capital stock, (ii) stock repurchases, and (iii) sales and the transfer of assets. The notes mature in 12 months, bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum, and are initially convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $0.23 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock combinations, dilutive issuances and similar events). Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the notes, the respective holder has the right to be prepaid at 140% of the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest, and interest accrues at 18% per annum (or the maximum amount permitted by law). In addition, if an event of default under a note has occurred, regardless of whether it has been cured or remains ongoing, such Note will thereafter be convertible at 65% of the lowest closing price of our common stock for the last 10 consecutive trading days.
Other than amounts owed under convertible notes, we have a commitment for a property lease which expires in February 2022.
The amount of future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:
Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditure will depend on our ability to roll out kiosks to serve the US market, we anticipate we could spend up to $1,000,000 in acquiring hardware in the next twelve month period.
Critical Accounting Policies
a) Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments. In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to; the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of long-lived investments, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
b) Contingencies
Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
c) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and notes payable, approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments. The Company has identified the short-term convertible notes and certain warrants attached to certain of the notes that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.
ASC 825-10 “Financial Instruments” allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. We evaluate the fair value of variably priced derivative liabilities on a quarterly basis and report any movements thereon in earnings.
d) Long-Term Assets
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
e) Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 606, Revenue.
The Company’s revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company derives its revenues from the sale of its services, as defined below. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its revenue transactions:
i. identify the contract with a customer;
ii. identify the performance obligations in the contract;
iii. determine the transaction price;
iv. allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
v. recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company had the following sources of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 which was recognized in discontinued operations on the basis described below.
● Revenue from the sale of services.
Prepaid services were acquired from providers and were sold to end-users through kiosks that the Company owned or kiosks that were owned by third parties. The Company recognized the revenue on the sale of these services when the end-user deposited funds into the terminal and the prepaid service was delivered to the end-user. The revenue was recognized at the gross value, including margin, of the prepaid service to the Company, net of any value-added tax which was collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities.
● Payment processing provided to end-users
We provide a secure means for end-users to pay for certain services, such as utilities through its kiosks. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we earned either a fixed per-transaction fee or a fixed percentage of the service sold. We acted as a collection agent and recognized the payment processing fee, net of any value-added taxes collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities (with respect to revenue generated prior to the sale of the Mexican operations), when the funds were deposited into the kiosk and the customer had settled his liability or had acquired a prepaid service.
● Revenue from the sale of kiosks.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we imported, assembled and sold kiosks that were used to generate the revenues discussed above. Revenues were recognized on the full value of the kiosks sold, net of any sales taxation collected on behalf of the Revenue authorities, when the customers took delivery of the kiosk and all the risks and rewards of ownership were passed to the customer.
f) Derivative Liabilities
ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re- measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Contractual Obligations
We have contractual obligations in the form of promissory notes and convertible notes which are described in the financial statements presented below.
Inflation
The effect of inflation on the Company’s operating results was not significant.
