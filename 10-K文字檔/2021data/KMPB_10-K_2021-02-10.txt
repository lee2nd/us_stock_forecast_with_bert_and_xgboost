Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Net Income was $409.9 million ($6.24 per unrestricted common share) for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $531.1 million ($8.04 per unrestricted common share) for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Beginning in March 2020, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions began to impact the Company's results of operations. The Company incurred additional expenses associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions. The Company’s investment results were also negatively impacted by the recent disruption in global financial markets. For further discussion regarding the potential impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company, see “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 1 and Item 1A., Risk Factors, of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As part of the Company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company recognized approximately $100 million of premium credits as a reduction to earned premiums in the second quarter of 2020. See MD&A, “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance” and “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance”, for additional information. The credits were applied directly to the policyholder's account statement. If a policyholder had paid in full, the policyholder received a refund of the credited amounts.
A reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS (Continued)
Net Income
2020 Compared with 2019
Net Income decreased by $121.2 million in 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to lower investment results, higher acquisition related transaction, integration and other costs and a pension noncash settlement charge, partially offset by higher Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income. Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income increased by $20.5 million in 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to higher Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance Segment Net Operating Income and Corporate and Other Net Operating Income, partially offset by lower Preferred Property & Casualty Segment Insurance Net Operating Income and Life & Health Segment Insurance Net Operating Income.
In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating income increased by $54.8 million due primarily to an improvement in underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums and higher investment income, partially offset by the impact of adverse loss reserve development. Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. See MD&A, “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,” beginning on page 35 for additional discussion of the segment’s results.
In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating income decreased by $38.4 million due primarily to higher catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding loss reserve development), the impact of adverse loss and LAE reserve development and lower net investment income, partially offset by an improvement in underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. See MD&A, “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,” beginning on page 40 for additional discussion of the segment’s results.
In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income decreased by $38.7 million due primarily to higher mortality for life insurance claims due primarily to COVID-19. See MD&A, “Life & Health Insurance,” beginning on page 46 for additional discussion of the segment’s results.
Corporate and Other net operating income increased due primarily to a gain recognized for the satisfaction of the remaining balance of a final judgment against Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) in connection with an arbitration award (the “CSC Judgment”), partially offset by higher acquisition related transaction, integration, and other costs and a pension noncash settlement charge.
The Company’s investment results were adversely impacted in 2020, compared to 2019, by a $52.7 million after-tax decrease from the change in fair value of the equity and convertible securities and a $3.0 million after-tax decrease from net realized gains on sales of investments, partially offset by $4.5 million after-tax of lower impairment losses. See MD&A, “Investment Results,” beginning on page 50 and MD&A, “Income Taxes,” beginning on page 57 and Note 23, “Contingencies.” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
2019 Compared with 2018
The Company’s net income increased by $341.0 million in 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to higher Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income, higher investment results and lower acquisition related transaction, integration and other costs. Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income increased by $159.9 million in 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to higher Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance and Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment net operating income, partially offset by a reduction in Corporate and Other Net Operating Income.
In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating income increased by $167.3 million due primarily to the inclusion of Infinity for twelve months of 2019 versus six months in 2018 and favorable underlying loss and prior year development. See MD&A, “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,” beginning on page 35 for additional discussion of the segment’s results.
In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $16.2 million due primarily to lower incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) and favorable prior year loss and LAE development (including a one-time recovery on prior year catastrophes), partially offset by lower net investment income and higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. See MD&A, “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,” beginning on page 40 for additional discussion of the segment’s results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)
SUMMARY OF RESULTS (Continued)
In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income increased by $7.2 million due primarily from a decrease in policyholders’ benefits and release in accrued reserves. See MD&A, “Life & Health Insurance,” beginning on page 46 for additional discussion of the segment’s results.
Corporate and Other net operating income decreased due primarily to a tax benefit as a result of the finalization of certain effects of Public Law 115-97, more commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), on deferred income taxes recognized in the third quarter of 2018 as well as lower gain recognized for the partial satisfaction of a final judgment against Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”). The Company’s investment results were favorably impacted in 2019, compared to 2018, by a $160.5 million after-tax increase from the change in fair value of the equity and convertible securities and a $12.2 million after-tax increase from net realized gains on sales of investments, partially offset by $7.3 million after-tax of higher impairment losses. See MD&A, “Investment Results,” beginning on page 50 and MD&A, “Income Taxes,” beginning on page 57 and Note 23, “Contingencies.” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Revenues
2020 Compared with 2019
Earned Premiums were $4,672.2 million in 2020, compared to $4,472.4 million in 2019, an increase of $199.8 million. Earned Premiums for the year ended December 31, 2020 included premium credits of $99.8 million related to COVID-19. Earned Premiums in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $256.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

See MD&A, “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance” and “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance” for discussion of the changes in each segment’s earned premiums.
Net Investment Income decreased by $16.1 million in 2020 due primarily to lower yields on fixed income securities and higher investment expenses, partially offset by higher rate of return from Alternative Investments and higher levels of investments in fixed income securities. Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments related to Equity Method Limited Liability investments increased by $3.9 million. Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments related to limited liability investments included in either Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost increased by $4.1 million.
Other Income increased by $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a gain of $89.4 million, compared to a gain of $20.1 million for the same period in 2019 related to the partial satisfaction of a final judgment against CSC. See Note 23, “Contingencies.” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. In July 2019, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with Hagerty to transfer the Company’s Classic Collectors book of business to Hagerty. Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a gain of $3.8 million related to this agreement. Beginning in 2020, the Company changed its presentation of COLI income by presenting such income in Net Investment Income. Prior to the change, COLI income was presented in Other Income. Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes $7.8 million related to COLI income.
Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments were $38.1 million in 2020, compared to $41.9 million in 2019. See MD&A, “Investment Results,” under the sub-caption “Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments” beginning on page 51 for additional discussion.

See MD&A, “Investment Results,” under the sub-caption “Impairment Losses” beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. The Company cannot predict when or if similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future.
2019 Compared with 2018
Earned Premiums were $4,472.4 million in 2019, compared to $3,384.4 million in 2018, an increase of $1,088.0 million. Earned Premiums increased by $1,051.0 million, $19.6 million and $17.4 million in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance Segment and Life & Health Insurance segment, respectively. See MD&A, “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,” beginning on page 35, MD&A, “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,” beginning on page 40 and MD&A, “Life & Health Insurance,” beginning on page 46 for discussion of the changes in each segment’s earned premiums.
Kemper Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)
SUMMARY OF RESULTS (Continued)
Net Investment Income increased by $23.4 million in 2019 due primarily to higher levels of investments, largely due to the inclusion of the Infinity portfolio beginning in July 2018, partially offset by a lower rate of return from Alternative Investments. Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments, which consist of Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost, increased by $18.4 million. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments decreased by $10.0 million. Alternative investment income from limited liability investments included in either Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost decreased by $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. See MD&A, “Investment Results,” under the sub-caption “Net Investment Income” beginning on page 50 for additional discussion.
Other Income decreased by $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a gain of $20.1 million, compared to a gain of $35.7 million for the same period in 2018 related to the partial satisfaction of a final judgment against CSC. See Note 23, “Contingencies.” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. In July 2019, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with Hagerty to transfer the Company’s Classic Collectors book of business to Hagerty. Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a gain of $3.8 million related to this agreement. Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes income of $7.8 million, compared to income of $3.6 million for the same period in 2018 from the Company’s corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies. Other Income from COLI increased due in part to the purchase of additional life insurance in the second and fourth quarters of 2019.
Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments were $41.9 million in 2019, compared to $26.4 million in 2018. See MD&A, “Investment Results,” under the sub-caption “Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments” beginning on page 51 for additional discussion. Impairment Losses in 2019 and 2018 were $13.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. See MD&A, “Investment Results,” under the sub-caption “Impairment Losses” beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. The Company cannot predict when or if similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future.
CATASTROPHES
Catastrophes and natural disasters are inherent risks of the property and casualty insurance business. These catastrophic events and natural disasters include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, high winds and winter storms. Such events result in insured losses that are, and will continue to be, a material factor in the results of operations and financial position of the Company’s property and casualty insurance companies. Further, because the level of these insured losses occurring in any one year cannot be accurately predicted, these losses may contribute to material year-to-year fluctuations in the results of operations and financial position of these companies. Specific types of catastrophic events are more likely to occur at certain times within the year than others. This factor adds an element of seasonality to property and casualty insurance claims. The Company has adopted the industry-wide catastrophe classifications of storms and other events promulgated by ISO to track and report losses related to catastrophes. ISO classifies a disaster as a catastrophe when the event causes $25.0 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers. ISO-classified catastrophes are assigned a unique serial number recognized throughout the insurance industry.

CATASTROPHES (Continued)
The number of ISO-classified catastrophic events and catastrophe losses and LAE, net of reinsurance recoveries, (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) by range of loss and business segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below.
Catastrophe Reinsurance
The Company primarily manages its exposure to catastrophes and other natural disasters through a combination of geographical diversification, restrictions on the amount and location of new business production in such regions, modifications of, and/or limitations to coverages and deductibles for certain perils in such regions and a catastrophe reinsurance program for the Company’s Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance and Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segments. Coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program is provided in various contracts and layers. The Company’s Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance and Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segments also purchase reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida at retentions lower than its catastrophe reinsurance program. The Life & Health Insurance segment also purchases reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida and is party to the Property & Casualty catastrophe reinsurance program for its Kemper Home Service companies.
In 2018, the Company had reinsurance recoveries of $31.8 million under its catastrophe reinsurance programs primarily driven by the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires. In 2019, the Company entered into a sale of subrogation rights resulting in a reduction of the reinsurance recoveries of $15.5 million. In 2020, the reinsurance recoveries were further reduced by $1.5 million. Catastrophe recoveries under the FHCF were not material in 2020, 2019, or 2018. In 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company paid $0.0 million, $0.0 million and $0.4 million in reinstatement premium, respectively. See the “Reinsurance” subsection of the “Property and Casualty Insurance Business” and “Life and Health Insurance Business” sections of Item 1(c), “Description of Business,” and Note 20, “Catastrophe Reinsurance,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s reinsurance programs.

LOSS AND LAE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT
Increases (decreases) in the Company’s property and casualty loss and LAE reserves for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to recognize adverse (favorable) loss and LAE reserve development from prior accident years in continuing operations, hereinafter also referred to as “reserve development” in the discussion of segment results, are presented below.
See MD&A, “Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,” MD&A, “Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,” MD&A, “Life & Health Insurance,” and Note 6, “Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s reserve development. See MD&A, “Critical Accounting Estimates,” of this 2020 Annual Report for additional information pertaining to the Company’s process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, and the estimated variability thereof, development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE, and a discussion of some of the variables that may impact them.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company is required to file consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company is permitted to include non-GAAP financial measures in its filings provided that they are defined along with an explanation of their usefulness to investors, are no more prominent than the comparable GAAP financial measures and are reconciled to such GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures, as they do not fully recognize the overall profitability of the Company’s businesses.
Underlying Losses and LAE and Underlying Combined Ratio
The following discussion of segment results uses the non-GAAP financial measures of (i) Underlying Losses and LAE and (ii) Underlying Combined Ratio. Underlying Losses and LAE (also referred to in the discussion as “Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE”) exclude the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years from the Company’s Incurred Losses and LAE, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The
Underlying Combined Ratio is computed by adding the Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the Combined Ratio, which is computed by adding Total Incurred Losses and LAE Ratio, including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years, with the Insurance Expense Ratio.
The Company believes Underlying Losses and LAE and the Underlying Combined Ratio are useful to investors and uses these financial measures to reveal the trends in the Company’s Property & Casualty Insurance segment that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve development. These catastrophe losses may cause the Company’s loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and LAE and the Combined Ratio. Prior-year reserve developments are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Because reserve development relates to the re-estimation of losses from earlier periods, it has no bearing on the performance of the Company’s insurance products in the current period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company’s underwriting performance.
Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income
Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure and is computed by excluding from Income from Continuing Operations the after-tax impact of:
(i) Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities;
(ii) Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments;
Kemper Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)
(iii) Impairment Losses;
(iv) Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs;
(v) Debt Extinguishment, Pension and Other Charges; and
(vi) Significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations
Significant non-recurring items are excluded when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, and (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Income from Continuing Operations. There were no applicable significant non-recurring items that the Company excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.
The Company believes that Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded. Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities, Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Impairment Losses related to investments included in the Company’s results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the Company’s investments, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration Costs may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by the timing of acquisitions and business decisions which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Debt Extinguishment, Pension and Other Charges relate to (i) loss from early extinguishment of debt, which is driven by the Company’s financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs, as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process; (ii) settlement of pension plan obligations which are business decisions are made by the Company, the timing of which is unrelated to the underwriting process; and (iii) other charges that are non-standard, not part of the ordinary course of business, and unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Significant non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of the Company’s business or economic trends.
The preceding non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures, as they do not fully recognize the overall profitability of the Company’s businesses.

See MD&A, “Critical Accounting Estimates,” under the caption “Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” beginning on page 63 for additional information pertaining to the Company’s process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE from prior accident years, also referred to as “reserve development” in the discussion of segment results, estimated variability of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, and a discussion of some of the variables that may impact development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE and the estimated variability of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE.
Overall
2020 Compared with 2019
The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $337.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $283.1 million in 2019. Segment Net Operating Income increased by $54.8 million due primarily to an improvement in underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums and higher investment income, partially offset by the impact of adverse loss reserve development. Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development.
Earned Premiums in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $256.9 million in 2020, compared to 2019, driven primarily by higher volume, partially offset by the impact of premium credits of $87.1 million issued to policyholders during the second quarter of 2020. Both of the segment’s product lines had higher volume, although the overall impact on earned premiums was driven primarily by specialty personal automobile insurance.
Net Investment Income in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $6.6 million in 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to a higher return on Alternative Investments and higher levels of fixed income securities, partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities.
Other Income in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment decreased by $5.2 million in 2020, compared to 2019. In July 2019, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with Hagerty to transfer the Company’s Classic Collectors book of business to Hagerty. Other Income in 2019 includes the $3.8 million gain related to the agreement with Hagerty.
Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 70.4% in 2020, an improvement of 4.3 percentage points, compared to 2019, due primarily to improvements in claim frequency. Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $12.3 million in 2020, compared to $11.1 million in 2019, an increase of $1.2 million. Unfavorable loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $15.3 million in 2020, compared to favorable development of $34.6 million in 2019.
Kemper Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)
SPECIALTY PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)
Insurance expenses were $651.9 million, or 19.5% of earned premiums, in 2020, a deterioration of 1.5% percentage points, compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of premium credits, insurance expenses were 19.0% of earned premium in 2020.
The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment’s effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions.
2019 Compared with 2018
The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $283.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $115.8 million in 2018. Segment net operating results improved by $167.3 million due primarily to the acquisition of Infinity in 2018 and favorable loss and LAE reserve development.
Earned Premiums in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $1,051.0 million in 2019, compared to 2018. Infinity accounted for $803.2 million of the increase in earned premiums, while higher volume and higher average earned premium accounted for the remaining increase. Both of the segment’s product lines had higher volume and higher average earned premium, although the overall impact on earned premiums was driven primarily by specialty personal automobile insurance.
Net Investment Income in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $44.1 million in 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to a higher investment base, largely due to the inclusion of the Infinity investment portfolio for the entire year in 2019 versus only a six month period in 2018, partially offset by lower rate of return on alternative investments.
Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 74.7% in 2019, an improvement of 0.2 percentage points, compared to 2018, due primarily to lower underlying losses as a percentage of earned premiums in commercial automobile insurance. Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $11.1 million in 2019, compared to $4.7 million in 2018, an increase of $6.4 million. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $34.6 million in 2019, compared to adverse development of $1.7 million in 2018.
Insurance expenses were $555.6 million, or 18.0% of earned premiums, in 2019, an improvement of 2.8% percentage points, compared to 2018, due primarily to lower amortization of Infinity purchase accounting adjustments in 2019, versus 2018.
Acquisition of Infinity
As discussed in Note 3, “Acquisition of Business,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company completed its acquisition of Infinity on July 2, 2018. The results of Infinity’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial results from the date of its acquisition and forward.

Specialty Personal Automobile Insurance
Selected financial information for the specialty personal automobile insurance product line for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below.
2020 Compared with 2019
Earned Premiums on specialty personal automobile insurance increased by $205.7 million in 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to higher volume, partially offset by premium credits of $83.5 million issued to policyholders during the second quarter of 2020. Incurred losses and LAE were $2,200.7 million, or 72.6% of earned premiums, in 2020, compared to $2,117.6 million, or 74.9% of earned premiums, in 2019. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums improved primarily due to an improvement in underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums, partially offset by adverse loss reserve development. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were 71.3% in 2020, compared to 75.4% in 2019, an improvement of 4.1 percentage points due primarily to improvements in claim frequency. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $11.6 million in 2020, compared to $9.9 million in 2019. Unfavorable loss and LAE reserve development was $28.2 million in 2020, compared to favorable development of $23.8 million in 2019.

2020 Compared with 2019
Earned premiums in commercial automobile insurance increased by $51.2 million in 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to higher volume, partially offset by premium credits of $3.6 million issued to policyholders during the second quarter of 2020. Incurred losses and LAE were $177.7 million, or 58.5% of earned premiums, in 2020, compared to $161.3 million, or 63.8% of earned premiums, in 2019. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums improved due primarily to an improvement in underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 62.5% in 2020, compared to 67.6% in 2019, an improvement of 5.1 percentage points due primarily to improvements in claim frequency.

Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 67.6% in 2019, compared to 72.0% in 2018, an improvement of 4.4 percentage points due primarily to lower frequency of claims in 2019 relative to the prior year.

during the second quarter of 2020. All lines experienced an overall decline in volume, although the overall impact was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance.
Net Investment Income in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment decreased by $6.4 million in 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to lower yields on fixed income securities, partially offset by higher levels of investments in fixed income securities and a higher rate of return on Alternative Investments.
Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 58.3% and 64.2% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $82.0 million in 2020, compared to $63.0 million in 2019, which is a increase of $19.0 million. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) increased due primarily to an increase in both frequency and severity of catastrophic events in 2020, compared to 2019. There were five catastrophic events above $5 million in 2020, compared to four catastrophic events above $5 million in 2019. Adverse loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $20.2 million in 2020, compared to favorable development of $36.0 million in 2019. Favorable catastrophe reserve development in 2019 included the impact of the recognition and sale in the third quarter of 2019 of the Company’s subrogation rights related to certain California wildfires that had occurred in 2017 and 2018.
Insurance expenses were $221.1 million, or 32.1% of earned premiums, in 2020, a deterioration of 1.0 percentage points compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of premium credits, insurance expenses were 31.5% of earned premiums.
The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment’s effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions.

The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to Segment Net Operating Loss of $25.7 million in 2018. Segment Net Operating Income improved by $16.2 million due primarily to lower incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) and favorable prior year loss and LAE development (including a recovery on prior year catastrophes) partially offset by higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums and lower net investment income.
Earned Premiums in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $19.6 million in 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to higher average earned premium in Preferred Automobile Insurance and Other Personal Insurance partially offset a decrease in volume for Preferred Automobile, Homeowners, and Other Insurance.
Net Investment Income in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment decreased by $17.7 million in 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to a lower rate of return on alternative investments.
Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 64.2% and 62.9% in 2019 and 2018. Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophe and loss and LAE reserve development. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $63.0 million in 2019, compared to $87.3 million in 2018, which is a decrease of $24.3 million due primarily to fewer catastrophic events in the greater than $25 million per event range in 2019, compared to 2018, and lower severity of other catastrophic events in 2019, compared to 2018. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $36.0 million in 2019, compared to $8.3 million in 2018. Favorable catastrophe reserve development in 2019 included the impact of the recognition and sale in the third quarter of 2019 of the Company’s subrogation rights related to certain California wildfires that had occurred in 2017 and 2018.
Insurance expenses were $233.3 million, or 31.1% of earned premiums, in 2019, a deterioration of 0.2 percentage points compared to 2018.

Use of Death Verification Databases
In the third quarter of 2016, the Company’s Life & Health segment voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process under which it cross-references its life insurance policies against the Death Master File and other death verification databases to identify potential situations where the beneficiaries may not have filed a claim following the death of an insured and initiate an outreach process to identify and contact beneficiaries and settle claims. Policyholders’ Benefits and Incurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a pre-tax charge of $77.8 million to recognize the initial impact of using death verification databases in the Company’s operations, including to determine its IBNR liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses for life insurance products.

At December 31, 2020, approximately 94% of the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio was rated investment-grade, which the Company defines as a security issued by a high quality obligor with at least a relatively stable credit profile and where it is highly likely that all contractual payments of principal and interest will timely occur and carry a rating from the NAIC of 1 or 2. Securities with a rating of 1 or 2 from the NAIC typically are rated by one of more Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations and either have a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P; a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody’s; or a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from Fitch.

INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
The Company owns investments in various limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships that primarily invest in mezzanine debt, distressed debt, real estate and senior debt. Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company’s investments in these limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships are reported either as Equity Method Limited Liability Investments at Cost Plus Cumulative Undistributed Earnings, Other Equity Interests and included in Equity Securities at Fair Value, or Equity Securities at Modified Cost depending on the accounting method used to report the investment. Additional information pertaining to these investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.
The Company expects that it will be required to fund its commitments over the next several years. The Company expects that the proceeds from distributions from these investments will be the primary source of funding of such commitments.

EXPENSES
Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were:
Insurance Expenses
Insurance Expenses increased by $80.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to growth in business. Insurance Expenses increased by $119.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to the inclusion of Infinity for the full twelve months in 2019 as compared to only six months in 2018, partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of VOBA.
Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt
On June 7, 2019, Kemper issued a notice of redemption for the entire $150.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of its 7.375% Subordinated Debentures due 2054 (the “7.375% Subordinated Debentures”) at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date. On July 8, 2019, Kemper completed the redemption, and the 7.375% Subordinated Debentures were repaid in full. The Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.8 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019
Interest and Other Expenses
Interest expense decreased by $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to the early extinguishment of the subordinated debenture in June 2019. Interest expense decreased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to lower levels of debt outstanding. See MD&A, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and Note 8, “Debt,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of debt activity.
Other Expenses increased by $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to Pension Settlement Expenses related to purchasing annuities on behalf of certain plan participants and lump-sum payments made to certain terminated vested participants and higher Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs. Other Expenses increased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, due primarily to higher employee compensation, bonuses and legal fees, partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the acquisition of Infinity and the related transaction and integration cost.

INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations differs from the Federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to (1) the effects of tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions, (2) nontaxable income associated with the change in cash surrender value on COLI, (3) Alternative Energy investment tax credits, (4) a permanent difference between the amount of long-term equity-based compensation expense recognized under GAAP and the amount deductible in the computation of Federal taxable income, (5) a permanent difference associated with nondeductible executive compensation, and (6) the Tax Act.
Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $19.0 million, $20.4 million and $22.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The nontaxable increase in cash surrender value on COLI was $12.9 million, $7.6 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company realized net investment tax credits of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The amount of expense recognized for long-term equity-based compensation expense under U.S. GAAP was $10.5 million, $21.0 million, and $6.7 million lower than the amount that would be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of nondeductible executive compensation was $13.0 million, $11.9 million, and $6.7 million for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The tax benefit recorded pursuant to the Tax Act was $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 16, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Common Stock Offering
On June 7, 2019, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock and issued 1,552,500 shares of common stock, at $83.00 per share. Gross proceeds from the offering were $128.9 million. Transaction costs, including the underwriting discount, were $1.7 million. In July 2019, the Company used the net proceeds of $127.2 million, together with a portion of the proceeds from delayed-draw term loan facility entered into by the Company on June 4, 2019 (the “2023 Term Loan”) to redeem all $150.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal of its 7.375% Subordinated Debentures due 2054.
Amended and Extended Credit Agreement and Term Loan Facility
On June 8, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and extended credit agreement and term loan facility. The amended and extended credit agreement increased the borrowing capacity of the existing unsecured credit agreement to $300.0 million and extended the maturity date to June 8, 2023. The term loan facility included a delayed draw feature with borrowing capacity of $250.0 million and a maturity date two years from the borrowing date (see discussion below under the heading, “Repayment of Term Loan Due 2020,”for additional information regarding the initial borrowing and subsequent repayment of this delayed-draw term loan). On June 4, 2019, the Company utilized the the accordion feature under the credit agreement to increase its credit borrowing capacity by $100.0 million, resulting in the available credit commitments increasing from $300.0 million to $400.0 million. The Company incurred $0.1 million in additional debt issuance costs in connection with the utilization of the accordion feature, which in addition to the $0.9 million of remaining unamortized costs under the credit agreement, will be amortized under the remaining term of the credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at either December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
Long-term Debt
The Company designates debt obligations as either short-term or long-term based on maturity date at issuance. Total amortized cost of Long-term Debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was:

Infinity’s liabilities at the acquisition date included $275.0 million principal amount, 5.000% Senior Notes due September 19, 2022 (the “2022 Senior Notes”). The 2022 Senior Notes were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, $282.1 million, with the $7.1 million premium being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term, resulting in an effective interest rate of 4.36%. On November 30, 2018, Kemper executed a guarantee to fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment and performance obligations of the 2022 Senior Notes.
4.350% Senior Notes Due 2025
Kemper has $450.0 million aggregate principal of 4.350% senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”) outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Kemper initially issued $250.0 million of the notes in February of 2015 and issued an additional $200.0 million of the notes in June of 2018. The additional notes are fungible with the initial notes issued in 2015, and together are treated as part of a single series for all purposes under the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured and may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time at Kemper’s option at specified redemption prices.
2.400% Senior Notes Due 2030
On September 22, 2020, Kemper offered and sold $400.0 million aggregate principal of 2.400% senior notes due September 30, 2030 (“2030 Senior Notes”). The net proceeds of issuance were $395.6 million, net of discount and transaction costs for an effective yield of 2.52%. The 2030 Senior Notes are unsecured and may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time at Kemper’s option at specified redemption prices. Kemper is using the net proceeds from the issuance for general corporate purposes.
Redemption of 7.375% Subordinated Debentures Due 2054
On June 7, 2019, Kemper issued a notice of redemption for the entire $150.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of its 7.375% Subordinated Debentures due 2054 (the “7.375% Subordinated Debentures”) at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date. On July 8, 2019, Kemper completed the redemption, and the 7.375% Subordinated Debentures were repaid in full. The Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.8 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company used the proceeds received from Kemper’s common stock offering on June 7, 2019, as well as a portion of the proceeds from its July 5, 2019 borrowing under the 2023 Term Loan, to repay the 7.375% Subordinated Debentures. See Note 8, “Debt,” and Note 10, “Shareholders’ Equity,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Federal Home Loan Bank Agreements
Kemper’s subsidiaries, United Insurance, Trinity Universal Insurance Company (“Trinity”) and Alliance United Insurance Company (“Alliance”) are members of the FHLB of Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco, respectively. Alliance became a member of the FHLB of San Francisco in August 2020. United Insurance became a member of the FHLB of Chicago in March 2014. Trinity became a member of the FHLB of Dallas in December 2013. Under their memberships, United, Trinity and Alliance may borrow through the advance program of their respective FHLB. As a requirement of membership in the FHLB, United Insurance, Trinity and Alliance must maintain certain levels of investment in FHLB common stock and additional amounts based on the level of outstanding borrowings. The Company’s investments in FHLB common stock are reported at cost and included in Equity Securities at Modified Cost. The carrying value of FHLB of Chicago common stock was $11.8 million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The carrying value of FHLB of Dallas common stock was $3.4 million and $3.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The carrying value of FHLB of San Francisco common stock was $1.7 million at December 31, 2020.

borrowings for spread lending purposes.
During 2020, United Insurance received advances of $466.4 million from the FHLB of Chicago and made repayments of $302.0 million under the spread lending program. United Insurance had outstanding advances from the FHLB of Chicago totaling $407.8 million at December 31, 2020. These advances were made in connection with the Company’s spread lending program. The proceeds related to these advances were used to purchase fixed maturity securities to earn incremental net investment income. With respect to these advances, United Insurance held pledged securities in a custodial account with the FHLB of Chicago with a fair value of $530.5 million at December 31, 2020. The fair value of the collateral pledged must be maintained at certain specified levels above the borrowed amount, which can vary depending on the assets pledged. If the fair value of the collateral declines below these specified levels of the amount borrowed, United Insurance would be required to pledge additional collateral or repay outstanding borrowings. See Note 7, “Policyholder Obligations,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the United Insurance advances and related funding agreements.
Common Stock Repurchases
On May 6, 2020, Kemper’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $200 million of Kemper common stock, in addition to the $243.7 million remaining under the previous authorization as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $333.3 million under the repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Kemper repurchased and retired 1.6 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions under its share repurchase authorization for an aggregate cost of $110.4 million and average cost per share of $68.29.
Kemper did not repurchase any of its common stock in open market transactions in 2019 or 2018.
Dividends to Shareholders
Kemper paid a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share for each quarter of 2020 and $0.25 per common share for the first three quarters of 2019 and $0.28 for the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively. Dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $78.9 million and $67.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Subsidiary Dividends and Capital Contributions
Various state insurance laws restrict the ability of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends without regulatory approval. Such insurance laws generally restrict the amount of dividends paid in an annual period to the greater of statutory net income from the previous year or 10% of statutory capital and surplus. Kemper’s direct insurance subsidiaries collectively paid $322.0 million, $239.0 million and $130.4 million in dividends to Kemper in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2021, Kemper estimates that its direct insurance subsidiaries would be able to pay approximately $402.8 million in dividends to Kemper without prior regulatory approval.
Kemper made capital contributions to insurance subsidiaries of $62 million and $83 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Sources and Uses of Funds
Kemper directly held cash and investments totaling $733.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $206.8 million at December 31, 2019.
The primary sources of funds available for repayment of Kemper’s indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, future shareholder dividend payments and the payment of interest on Kemper’s senior notes and term loan, include cash and investments directly held by Kemper, receipt of dividends from Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries and borrowings under the credit agreement and from subsidiaries.
The primary sources of funds for Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment income, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments, advances from the FHLBs of Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco, and capital contributions from Kemper. The primary uses of funds are the payment of policyholder benefits under life insurance contracts, claims under property and casualty insurance contracts and accident and health insurance contracts, the payment of commissions and general expenses, the purchase of investments and repayments of advances from the FHLBs of Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)
Generally, there is a time lag between when premiums are collected and when policyholder benefits and insurance claims are paid. During periods of growth, property and casualty insurance companies typically experience positive operating cash flows
and are able to invest a portion of their operating cash flows to fund future policyholder benefits and claims. During periods in which premium revenues decline, insurance companies may experience negative cash flows from operations and may need to sell investments to fund payments to policyholders and claimants. In addition, if the Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments, which could result in either investment gains or losses. Management believes that its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain adequate levels of liquidity in the event that they were to experience several future catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Estimated cash disbursements pertaining to the Company’s contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 are presented below.
Amounts included in Life and Health Insurance Policy Benefits within the contractual obligations table above represent the estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and beneficiaries. Such cash outflows are based on the Company’s current assumptions for mortality, morbidity and policy lapse, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. Policies must remain in force for the policyholder or beneficiary to receive the benefit under the policy. Depending on the terms of a particular policy, future premiums from the policyholder may be required for the policy to remain in force. The Company estimates that future cash inflows would total $4.2 billion using the same assumptions used to estimate the cash outflows. The Company’s Life Insurance Reserves in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are generally based on the historical assumptions for mortality and policy lapse rates and are on a discounted basis. Accordingly, the sum of the amounts presented above for Life and Health Insurance Policy Benefits significantly exceeds the amount of Life and Health Insurance Reserves reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020.
In addition to the purchase obligations included above, the Company had certain investment commitments totaling $303.8 million at December 31, 2020. The funding of such investment commitments is dependent on a number of factors, the timing of which is indeterminate. The Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any, for such liability. Other Contractual Obligations Reflected in Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under GAAP primarily consist of interest obligations related to Long Term Debt Obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Kemper’s subsidiaries conduct their operations in two industries: property and casualty insurance and life and health insurance. Accordingly, the Company is subject to several industry-specific accounting principles under GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The process of estimation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results could ultimately differ materially from the estimated amounts reported in a company’s financial statements.
Different assumptions are likely to result in different estimates of reported amounts. The Company’s critical accounting policies most sensitive to estimates include the valuation of investments, the valuation of reserves for property and casualty insurance incurred losses and LAE, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and the valuation of pension benefit obligations.
Valuation of Investments
The reported value of the Company’s investments was $10,424.1 million at December 31, 2020, of which $8,504.3 million, or 82%, was reported at fair value, $225.3 million, or 2%, was reported under the equity method of accounting, $297.9 million or 3%, was reported at unpaid principal balance and $1,396.6 million, or 13%, was reported at cost, modified cost or depreciated cost. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and overall market volatility risk. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair values of the Company’s investments reported at fair value will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Also, it is reasonably possible that changes in the carrying values of the Company’s Equity Method Limited Liability Investments will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements because these issuers follow specialized industry accounting rules which require that they report all of their investments at fair value (See Item

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)
1A., “Risk Factors” under the title “The Company’s investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses”).
As more fully described under the heading, “Fair Value Measurements,” in Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounting Changes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a hierarchical framework which prioritizes and ranks the market observability used in fair value measurements.
The fair value of the Company’s investments measured and reported at fair value was $8,504.3 million at December 31, 2020, of which $7,762.9 million, or 91%, were investments that were based on quoted market prices or significant value drivers that are observable, $449.2 million, or 5%, were investments where at least one significant value driver was unobservable and $292.2 million or 3% were investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Fair value measurements based on readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally are deemed to have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment, compared to fair value measurements based on significant unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value. The prices that the Company might realize from actual sales of investments are likely to vary from their respective estimated fair values at December 31, 2020 due to changing market conditions and limitations inherent in the estimation process.
The classification of a company’s investment in a financial instrument may affect its reported results. Under GAAP, a company may elect to use the fair value option method of accounting for some or all of its investments in financial instruments. Under the fair value option method of accounting, a company is required to recognize changes in fair values into income for the period reported. The Company has elected the fair value option for investments in fixed maturities with equity conversion features which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Convertible Securities. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company’s investments in Convertible Securities accounted for under the fair value option method of accounting were $39.9 million at December 31, 2020. For investments in fixed maturities classified as held to maturity, a company is required to carry the investment at amortized cost, with only amortization occurring during the period recognized into income. None of the Company’s investments in fixed maturities were classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2020. Changes in the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale are not recognized in income during the period, but rather are recognized as a separate component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) until realized. Both the reported and fair values of the Company’s investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale were $7,605.9 million at December 31, 2020.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded as Equity Securities at Fair Value with changes in fair values recognized into income for the period reported. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company’s investments in Equity Securities at Fair Value were $858.5 million at December 31, 2020. The Company holds certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. Changes in the carrying value of Equity Securities at Modified Cost due to observable price changes are recorded into income for the period reported.
The Company’s portfolio also includes investments in Alternative Energy Partnerships that are accounted for under the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (“HLBV”) method. Under the HLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributed to investors reflect changes in the amounts the fund investors would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual agreements of these funds. Attributing income and loss under the HLBV method requires the use of significant assumptions and forecasts to calculate the amounts that fund investors would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation. See Note 2 “Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounting Changes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Had the Company elected the fair value option for all of its investments in financial instruments, the Company’s reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, would have increased by $292.3 million.
The Company regularly reviews its fixed maturity investment portfolio and holdings in Equity Securities at Modified Cost for factors that may indicate a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost, amortized cost or modified cost basis.

Such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods. Some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value of an investment exist include, but are not limited to, the following:
Fixed Maturity Securities
•The financial condition, credit rating and prospects of the issuer;
•The length of time and magnitude of the unrealized loss;
•The ability of the issuer to make scheduled principal and interest payments;
•The volatility of the investment;
Equity Securities at Modified Cost
•Opinions of the Company’s external investment managers;
•The financial condition and prospects of the issuer;
•Current market conditions;
•Changes in credit ratings; and
•Changes in the regulatory environment.
Changes in these factors from their December 31, 2020 evaluation date could result in the Company determining that a decline in the fair value exists for an investment held and evaluated at December 31, 2020. Such determination would result in an impairment loss in the period such determination is made.
Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves are reported using the Company’s estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and LAE for claims that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not yet been paid. The Company had $1,982.5 million and $1,969.8 million of gross loss and LAE reserves at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for the Company’s business segments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were:
In estimating the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves, the Company’s actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify. Accordingly, the process of estimating and establishing the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is inherently uncertain, and the actual ultimate cost of known and unknown claims may vary materially from the estimated amounts reserved.
The Company’s actuaries estimate reserves at least quarterly for most product lines and/or coverage levels using accident quarters or years spanning 10 or more years, depending on the product line and/or coverage level or emerging issues relating to them. The Company’s actuaries use a variety of generally accepted actuarial loss reserving estimation methodologies, including, but not limited to, the following:
•Incurred Loss Development Methodology;
•Paid Loss Development Methodology;
•Bornhuetter-Ferguson Incurred Loss Methodology;
•Bornhuetter-Ferguson Paid Loss Methodology; and
•Frequency and Severity Methodology.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)
The Company’s actuaries generally review the results of at least four of the estimation methodologies, two based on paid data and two based on incurred data, to initially estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for the current accident quarter or year and re-estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for previous accident quarters or years to determine if changes in the previous estimates of the ultimate losses and LAE are indicated by the most recent data. In some cases, the methodologies produce a cluster of estimates with a tight band of indicated possible outcomes. In other cases, however, the methodologies produce conflicting results and wider bands of indicated possible outcomes, and the Company’s actuaries perform additional analyses before making their final selections. However, such bands do not necessarily constitute a range of outcomes, nor does the Company’s management or the Company’s actuaries calculate a range of outcomes.
The key assumption in these estimation methodologies is that patterns observed in prior periods are indicative of how losses and LAE are expected to develop in the future and that such historical data can be used to predict and estimate ultimate losses and LAE. However, changes in the Company’s business processes, by their very nature, are likely to affect the development patterns, which means the Company’s actuaries must routinely make assumptions about how changes in business practices would affect historical patterns.
The ultimate impact of a single change in a business process is difficult to quantify and detect, and even more difficult if several changes to business processes occur over several years. Initially after a change is implemented, there are fewer data points, as compared to the historical data, for the Company’s actuaries to analyze. With fewer data points to analyze, the Company’s actuaries cannot be certain that observed differences from the historical data trends are a result of the change in business process or merely a random fluctuation in the data. As the Company’s actuaries observe more data points following the change in business process, the Company’s actuaries can gain more confidence in whether the change in business process is affecting the development pattern. The challenge for the Company’s actuaries is how much weight to place on the development patterns based on the older historical data and how much weight to place on the development patterns based on more recent data.
For each accident quarter or year, the point estimate selected by the Company’s actuaries is not necessarily one of the points produced by any particular one of the methodologies utilized, but often is another point selected by the Company’s actuaries, using their professional judgment, that takes into consideration each of the points produced by the several loss reserving estimation methodologies used. In some cases, for a particular product, the current accident quarter or year may not have enough paid claims data to rely upon, leading the Company’s actuaries to conclude that the incurred loss development methodology provides a better estimate than the paid loss development methodology. Therefore, the Company’s actuaries may give more weight to the incurred loss development methodology for that particular accident quarter or year. As an accident quarter or year ages for that same product, the actuary may gain more confidence in the paid loss development methodology and begin to give more weight to the paid loss development methodology. The Company’s actuaries’ quarterly selections are summed by product and/or coverage levels to create the actuarial indication of the ultimate losses. More often than not, the actuarial indication for a particular product line and accident quarter or year is most heavily weighted toward the incurred loss development methodology, particularly for short-tail lines such as personal automobile insurance. Historically, the incurred loss development methodology has been more reliable in predicting ultimate losses for short-tail lines, especially in the more recent accident quarters or years, compared with the paid loss development methodology. However, in some circumstances changes can occur which impact numerous variables, including, but not limited to, those variables identified below that are difficult to quantify and/or impact the predictive value of prior development patterns relied upon in the incurred loss development methodology and paid loss development methodology. In those circumstances, the Company’s actuaries must make adjustments to these loss reserving estimation methodologies or use additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies. In those circumstances, the Company’s actuaries, using their professional judgment, may place more weight on the adjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies or other generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies until the newer development patterns fully emerge and the Company’s actuaries can fully rely on the unadjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies. In the event of a wide variation among results generated by the different projection methodologies, the Company’s actuaries further analyze the data using additional techniques.
In estimating reserves, the Company’s actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify, such as:
•Changes in the level of minimum case reserves, and the automatic aging of those minimum case reserves;
•Changes to claims practices, including, but not limited to, changes in the reporting and impact of large losses, timing of reported claims, changes in claims closing and re-opening patterns, adequacy of case reserves, implementation of new systems for handling claims, turnover of claims department staffs, timing and depth of the audit review of claims handling procedures;
•Changes in underwriting practices;
Kemper Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)
•Changes in the mix of business by state, class and policy limit within product line;
•Growth in new lines of business;
•Changes in the attachment points of the Company’s reinsurance programs;
•Medical costs, including, but not limited to, the ability to assess the extent of injuries and the impact of inflation;
•Repair costs, including, but not limited to, the impact of inflation and the availability of labor and materials;
•Changes in the judicial environment, including, but not limited to, the interpretation of policy provisions, the impact of jury awards and changes in case law; and
•Changes in state regulatory requirements.
A change in any one or more of the foregoing factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate net loss and LAE that is different from the previously estimated reserve and/or previous frequency and severity trends. Such changes in estimates may be material.
For example, the Company’s actuaries review frequency (number of claims per policy or exposure), severity (dollars of loss per claim) and average premium (dollars of premium per exposure). Actual frequency and severity experienced will vary depending on changes in mix by class of insured risk. Similarly, the actual frequency and rate of recovery from reinsurance will vary depending on changes in the attachment point for reinsurance. In particular, in periods of high growth or expansion into new markets, there may be additional uncertainty in estimating the ultimate losses and LAE. The contributing factors of this potential risk are changes in the Company’s mix by policy limit and mix of business by state or jurisdiction.
Actuaries use historical experience and trends as predictors of how losses and LAE will emerge over time. However, historical experience may not necessarily be indicative of how actual losses and LAE will emerge. Changes in case reserve adequacy, changes in minimum case reserves and changes in internal claims handling procedures could impact the timing and recognition of incurred claims and produce an estimate that is either too high or too low if not adjusted for by the actuary. For example, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claims are settled more rapidly than they were settled historically, the estimate produced by the paid loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures. Similarly, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claim reserves are set at levels higher than past experience, the estimate produced by the incurred loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures.
The final step in the quarterly loss and LAE reserving process involves a comprehensive review of the actuarial indications by the Company’s chief actuary and corporate management who apply their collective judgment and determine the appropriate estimated level of reserves to record. Numerous factors are considered in this determination process, including, but not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications, changes in claim handling practices or other changes that affect the timing of payment or development patterns, changes in the mix of business, the maturity of the accident quarter or year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to prior periods, and the amount of reserves related to third party pools for which the Company does not have access to the underlying data and, accordingly, relies on calculations provided by such pools.
Estimated Variability of Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves
The Company’s goal is to ensure that its total reserves for property and casualty insurance losses and LAE are adequate to cover all costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves for losses and LAE are initially estimated until losses and LAE are fully paid. Changes in the Company’s estimates of these losses and LAE over time, also referred to as “development,” will occur and may be material. Favorable development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company decreases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in an increase in net income in the period recognized, whereas adverse development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company increases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in a decrease in net income.
Although development will emerge in all of the Company’s product lines, development in the Company’s specialty personal automobile insurance product line could have the most significant impact due to the relative size of its loss and LAE reserves. To further illustrate the sensitivity of the Company’s reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance losses and LAE, the Company measures the standard deviation of the mean reserve estimate using a bootstrapping methodology. The Company
Kemper Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)
believes that one standard deviation of variability is a reasonably likely scenario to measure variability for its loss and LAE reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance. The Company estimates that the Company’s specialty personal automobile insurance loss and LAE reserves could have varied by $84.6 million in either direction at December 31, 2020 for all accident years combined under this scenario. In addition to the factors described above, other factors may also impact loss reserve development in future periods. These factors include governmental actions, including court decisions interpreting existing laws, regulations or policy provisions, developments related to insurance policy claims and coverage issues, adverse or favorable outcomes in pending claims litigation, the number and severity of insurance claims, the impact of inflation on insurance claims and the impact of required participation in windpools and joint underwriting associations and residual market assessments. Although the Company’s actuaries do not make specific numerical assumptions about these factors, changes in these factors from past patterns will impact historical loss development factors and, in turn, future loss reserve development. Significant favorable changes in one or more factors will lead to favorable future loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even below, the lower end of the Company’s estimated reserve variability. Significant unfavorable changes in one or more factors will lead to unfavorable loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even above, the higher end of the Company’s estimated reserve variability. Accordingly, due to these factors and the other factors enumerated throughout the MD&A and the inherent limitations of the loss reserving estimation methodologies, the estimated and illustrated reserve variability may not necessarily be indicative of the Company’s future reserve variability, which could ultimately be greater than the estimated and illustrated variability. In addition, as previously noted, development will emerge in all of the Company’s product lines over time. Accordingly, the Company’s future reserve variability could ultimately be greater than the illustrated variability. Additional information pertaining to the estimation of, and development of, the Company’s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is contained in Item 1 of Part I of this 2020 Annual Report under the heading “Property and Casualty Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.”
Goodwill Recoverability
The Company tests goodwill for recoverability at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may have declined below its carrying value. The Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units with goodwill as of October 1, 2020. The qualitative assessment takes into consideration changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy, events impacting reporting units, and changes in Kemper’s stock price since the last quantitative assessment, which was performed on January 1, 2017. Based on its qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that the associated goodwill was recoverable for each reporting unit tested.
Pension Benefit Obligations
The process of estimating the Company’s pension benefit obligations and pension benefit costs is inherently uncertain and the actual cost of benefits may vary materially from the estimates recorded. These liabilities are particularly volatile due to their long-term nature and are based on several assumptions. The main assumptions used in the valuation of the Company’s pension benefit obligations and pension costs are:
•Estimated mortality of the participants and beneficiaries eligible for benefits;
•Estimated expected long-term rates of returns on investments; and
•Estimated rate used to discount the expected benefit payment to a present value.
A change in any one or more of these assumptions is likely to result in a projected benefit obligation or pension cost that differs from the actuarial estimates at December 31, 2020. Such changes in estimates may be material.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has no material obligations under guarantee contracts. The Company has no material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. The Company has no material obligations, including contingent obligations, under contracts that would be accounted for as derivative instruments. The Company has no obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity held by, and material to, the Company, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Accordingly, the Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
