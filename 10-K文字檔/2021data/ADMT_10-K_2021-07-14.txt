CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
REVENUE RECOGNITION
ELECTRONICS:
We recognize revenue from the sale of our electronic products when they are shipped to the purchaser. We offer a limited 90-day warranty on our electronics products and contract manufacturing and a limited 5-year warranty on our electronic controllers for spas and hot tubs. Historically, the amount of warranty revenue included in sales of our electronic products have been de minimus. We have no other post shipment obligations. Based on prior experience, no amounts have been accrued for potential warranty costs and actual costs were less than $2,000, for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. For contract manufacturing, revenues are recognized after shipment of the completed products.
Amounts received from customers in advance of our satisfaction of applicable performance obligations are recorded as customer deposits. Such amounts are recognized as revenues when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Customer deposits of approximately $195,000 as of March 31, 2020 were recognized as revenues during the year ended March 31, 2021.
CHEMICAL PRODUCTS:
Revenues are recognized when products are shipped to end users. Shipments to distributors are recognized as revenue when no right of return exists.
ENGINEERING SERVICES
We provide certain engineering services, including research, development, quality control and quality assurance services along with regulatory compliance services. We recognize revenue from engineering services on a monthly basis over time as the applicable performance obligations are satisfied.
All revenue is recognized net of discounts.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
ADM extends credit terms to our customers based on their credit worthiness. As such, we record accounts receivable at the time of shipment, when our right to the consideration becomes unconditional. Accounts receivable from our customers are typically due within 30 days of invoicing. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on a periodic analysis of individual account balances, including an evaluation of days outstanding, payment history, recent payment trends, and our assessment of our customers' creditworthiness.
USE OF ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to reserves, deferred tax assets and valuation allowance, impairment of long-lived assets, fair value of equity instruments issued to consultants for services and fair value of equity instruments issued to others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates, including those for the above described items, are reasonable.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
On December 18, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”, which modifies ASU 740 to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating if any of these modifications will have an impact on its financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses”. This guidance affects organizations that hold financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income. The guidance requires organizations to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods with those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncement, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
ADM is a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 24, 1969.
We are a technology-based developer and manufacturer of diversified lines of products and services in the following areas: electronics for non-invasive medical and other applications; research, development, regulatory and engineering services; and, environmentally safe chemical products for industrial, cosmetic and topical uses.
REVENUES
Revenues decreased $395,361, or 11% from the prior year, which resulted from decreases of $72,199 in the electronic segment, $124,003 in the chemicals segment, and $199,159 in the engineering segment. The decreases were primarily the result of reduced purchasing from customers due to the effect of the shutdown and safety restrictions on elective medical procedures, film productions and certain development and manufacturing activities from the COVID-19 pandemic.
OPERATING (LOSS)
Loss from operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $680,478. Loss from operations for the year ended March 31, 2020 was $43,389, an increase in loss of $637,089. This was a result of decreased revenue coupled with an increase in cost of goods sold due to adjustments to inventory, as well as an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $125,946 or 14%, from $923,252 to $1,049,198, mainly due to an increase of $29,733 in salaries, $18,410 in professional fees, $36,365 in health insurance, $27,929 in royalties and commissions and $10,000 in bad debt.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Net (loss) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was ($598,276) and ($95,759) or ($0.01) and ($0.00) per share, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,546,950 as compared to $1,438,714 at March 31, 2020. The increase of $108,236 was primarily the result of cash used in operations in the amount of $769,637, offset by cash provided by financing activities of $877,873. We expect to have enough cash to fund operations for the next twelve months.
Future Sources of Liquidity:
We expect our primary source of cash during fiscal 2022 to be net cash provided by operating activities. We expect that growth in profitable revenues and continued focus on new customers will enable us to continue to generate cash flows from operating activities.
If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, face unanticipated cash needs or do not otherwise have sufficient cash, we have the ability to reduce certain expenses depending on the level of business operation.
Based on current expectations, we believe that our existing cash of $1,546,950 as of March 31, 2021 and other potential sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. Our ability to meet these requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
Although we expect available funds and funds generated from our operations to be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for a minimum of 12 months, we may need to obtain additional capital to continue to operate and grow our business. Our cash requirements may vary materially from those currently anticipated due to changes in our operations, including our marketing and sales activities, product development, and the timing of our receipt of revenues. As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately $174,000 available for use through our line of credit. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions, as well as our business performance. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Additionally, we will continue to reduce certain of our expenses in order to assist in meeting our capital needs.
IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.. We began to see the impact of COVID-19 during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 with certain of our customers being required to close and/or suspend their own operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, net sales and production levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the majority of fiscal 2021 were reduced, thus impacting our results of operations during these quarters. In May 2020, we received a loan of approximately $381,000 under the U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program, to assist with the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. In February 2021, we received a second loan of approximately $333,000 under the U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial results and liquidity will depend on future developments and the financial condition of our customers that we may not be able to foresee. Any of these factors, and other factors beyond our control, can adversely impact our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as the full fiscal year, and such impact may be material.
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Net cash used by operating activities was $769,637 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Cash used during the year ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to net loss of $598,276, an increase in net operating assets of $337,307, a decrease in net operating liabilities of $136,191 and an increase in deferred taxes of $62,000, partially offset by write-off of inventories of $121,999, an increase in reserve for bad debt of $75,000, depreciation and amortization of $149,535, and stock based compensation of $17,603.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $109,265 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Cash provided during the year ended March 31, 2020 was primarily due to write-off of inventories of $136,465, an increase in reserve for bad debt of $65,000, an increase in operating liabilities of $44,035, depreciation and amortization of $104,351, and decreases in deferred taxes of $88,000, partially offset by net loss of $95,759 and an increase in net operating assets of $232,827.

INFLATION

However, general economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, specifically fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings in the foreseeable future.
