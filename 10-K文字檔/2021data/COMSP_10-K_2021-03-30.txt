ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been restated to reflect the implementation of the 1-for-3 reverse stock split effected on January 21, 2021 as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Business Overview
We are a provider of technologically-advanced telecom solutions to network operators, mobile device carriers, governmental units and other enterprises worldwide. We have assembled a portfolio of communications, power and niche technologies, capabilities and products that enable the upgrading of latent 3G networks to 4G and 4G-LTE networks and will facilitate the rapid roll out of the 5G and “next-Generation” (“nG”) networks of the future. We focus on special capabilities, including signal modulations, antennae, software, hardware and firmware technologies that enable increasingly efficient data transmission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Our product solutions are complemented by a broad array of services, including technical support, systems design and integration, and sophisticated research and development programs. While we compete globally on the basis of our innovative technology, the breadth of our product offerings, our high-quality cost-effective customer solutions, and the scale of our global customer base and distribution, our primary focus is on the North American telecom infrastructure and service market. We believe we are in a unique position to rapidly increase our near-term domestic sales as we are among the few U.S.-based providers of telecommunications equipment and services.
Corporate History
We were incorporated in Nevada on April 17, 2014, as a wholly owned subsidiary of MacroSolve, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (“MacroSolve”), and effective April 30, 2014, in order to consolidate our operations into an entity incorporated in Nevada, MacroSolve merged with and into us. On June 3, 2014, we acquired Drone Aviation Corp. through a share exchange transaction, and on March 26, 2015, Drone Aviation Corp. merged with and into us. As a result of the share exchange and merger with Drone Aviation Corp., we acquired Drone Aviation Corp.’s subsidiary, Lighter Than Air Systems Corp., which does business under the name Drone Aviation.
On November 27, 2019, we completed the COMSovereign Acquisition in a stock-for-stock transaction with a total purchase price of approximately $75 million. The COMSovereign Acquisition was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes under U.S. GAAP with COMSovereign as the accounting acquirer and our Company as the accounting acquiree. As a result, our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report are those of COMSovereign from the date of its incorporation (January 10, 2019) through December 31, 2019. The operations of our pre-acquisition business, which consisted primarily of the operations of Drone Aviation, are included in our consolidated operating results only from the date of acquisition of COMSovereign, November 27, 2019.
COMSovereign Corp. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 10, 2019 and commenced operations through a series of acquisitions.
On January 31, 2019, COMSovereign acquired the capital stock of VEO, a San Diego, California-based research and development company innovating SiP technologies for use in copper-to-fiber-to-copper switching, high-speed computing, high-speed ethernet, autonomous vehicle applications, mobile devices and 5G wireless equipment.
On January 31, 2019, COMSovereign acquired the capital stock of InduraPower, a Tucson, Arizona-based developer and manufacturer of intelligent batteries and back-up power supplies for network systems and telecom nodes. It also provides power designs and batteries for the aerospace, marine and automotive industries.
On March 4, 2019, COMSovereign acquired the capital stock of Silver Bullet, a California-based engineering firm that designs and develops next generation network systems and components, including large scale network protocol development, software-defined radio systems and wireless network designs.
On April 1, 2019, COMSovereign acquired the equity securities of DragonWave, a Dallas-based manufacturer of high-capacity microwave and millimeter point-to-point telecom backhaul radio units. DragonWave and its predecessor have been selling telecom backhaul radios since 2012 and its microwave radios have been installed in over 330,000 locations in more than 100 countries worldwide. According to a report by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, as of December 2019, DragonWave was the second largest provider of licensed point-to-point microwave backhaul radios in North America.
On April 1, 2019, COMSovereign acquired the capital stock of Lextrum, a Tucson, Arizona-based developer of full-duplex wireless technologies and components, including multi-reconfigurable RF antennae and software programs. This technology enables the doubling of a given spectrum band by allowing simultaneous transmission and receipt of radio signals on the same frequencies.
On November 30, 2019, following our acquisition of COMSovereign, we changed our corporate name to COMSovereign Holding Corp.
On March 6, 2020, our newly-formed subsidiary, Sovereign Plastics, acquired substantially all of the assets of a Colorado Springs, Colorado-based manufacturer of plastic and metal components to third-party manufacturers. We acquired our Sovereign Plastics business to increase our operating margins by reducing the manufacturing and production costs of our telecom products. Sovereign Plastics will also primarily operate as the material, component manufacturing and supply chain source for all of our subsidiaries. We do not expect the revenues of Sovereign Plastics from sales to third parties to be material.
On July 6, 2020, we acquired the equity securities of VNC, an edge centric wireless telecommunications technology developer and equipment manufacturer of both 4G LTE Advanced and 5G capable radio equipment. VNC designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and supports a line of network products for wireless network operators, mobile virtual network operators, cable TV system operators, and government and business enterprises that enable new sources of revenue, and reduce capital and operating expenses. VNC also has developed rapidly deployable, tactical systems that can be combined with the tethered aerostats and drones offered by our Drone Aviation subsidiary and enabled and operated in nearly any location in the world.
On January 29, 2021, we acquired Fastback, a manufacturer of intelligent backhaul radio (IBR) systems that deliver high-performance wireless connectivity to virtually any location, including those challenged by Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) limitations. Fastback’s advanced IBR products allow operators to economically add capacity and density to their macrocells and expand service coverage density with small cells. These solutions also allow operators to both provide temporary cellular and data service utilizing mobile/portable radio systems and provide wireless Ethernet connectivity.
On February 25, 2021, we acquired SKS, an Israeli-based company with tethered hovering technology that provides long-duration, mobile and all-weather Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (“ISR”) capabilities to customers worldwide for both land and marine based applications. Its innovative technologies include fiber optic tethers that enable secure, high-capacity communications, including support for commercial 4G and 5G wireless networks. SKS’s flagship HoverMast line of quadrotor-tethered drones feature uninterruptible ground-based power, fiber optic communications for cyber immunity, and the ability to operate in GPS-denied environments while delivering dramatically-improved situational awareness and communications capabilities to users. HoverMast is utilized by the Israeli government for border patrol and coastal applications and is also deployed in several international markets.
On March 26, 2021, we entered into the RVision Exchange Agreement pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the RVision Exchange Agreement, we have agreed to acquire RVision in consideration of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, subject to certain working capital adjustments. The RVision Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties and is subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions stated therein. RVision is a developer of technologically-advanced video and communications products and physical security solutions designed for government and private sector commercial industries. It has been serving governments and the military for nearly two decades with sophisticated, environmentally-rugged optical and infrared cameras, hardened processors, custom tactical video hardware, software solutions, and related communications technologies.
Each of our subsidiaries was acquired, and RVision will be acquired, to address a different opportunity or sector within the North American telecom infrastructure and service market.
Principle of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements included in this report include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries: Drone AFS Corp. and Lighter Than Air Systems Corp. (from the date of consummation of the COMSovereign Acquisition), and DragonWave, Lextrum, Silver Bullet, VEO, InduraPower, Sovereign Plastics and VNC from their respective dates of acquisition. These consolidated financial statements do not include the accounts of Fastback and SKS as they were acquired subsequent to the respective balance sheet dates.
Segment Information
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer, who currently reviews the financial performance and the results of operations of our operating subsidiaries on a consolidated basis when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of our Company. Accordingly, we currently consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment for reporting purposes focused on the North American development, manufacturing and production of products and services for the telecom infrastructure market.
As we are still in the early stages of developing our Company, we have historically managed our subsidiaries within this single operating segment and do not assess the performance of our product lines or geographic regions or other measures of income or expense, such as product expense, operating income or net income. Each of our subsidiaries is operated under the same senior management of our Company, and we view the operations of our subsidiaries as a whole for making business decisions. Employees of one subsidiary, particularly mechanical engineers, are often called upon to assist in the operations of another subsidiary. As the development of our Company matures and we move toward full scale production with increased marketing efforts, we will continue to evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements.
Significant Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenues
Our revenues are generated primarily from the sale of our products, which consist primarily of backhaul telecom radios and tethered aerostats and drones. At contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in the contract with customers and identify a performance obligation for each. To determine the performance obligation, we consider all products and services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. The timing of satisfaction of the performance obligation is not subject to significant judgment. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods and services. We generally recognize product revenues at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
We expect our revenues for the year ending December 31, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”) to materially exceed those of fiscal 2019 and 2020, primarily due to our availability of working capital, including from a portion of the net proceeds of the equity offerings we completed in 2021, for the purchase of parts and components and the manufacturing of products, primarily those of DragonWave, in quantities that greatly exceed the quantities that we were able to manufacture in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, we expect to commence commercial production of new products in 2021 that we have previously produced in only limited quantities or as prototypes, including, among others, intelligent battery back-up power solutions for the telecom, aerospace and transportation industries and airborne high-bandwidth, LTE-Advanced and 5G aerostats.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and fiscal 2019, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the COMSovereign Acquisition as if such acquisition had occurred on January 10, 2019, approximately 18% and 15%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the United States. While our near-term focus is on the North American telecom and infrastructure and service market, a key element of our growth strategy is to expand our worldwide customer base and our international operations, initially through agreements with third-party resellers, distributors and other partners that can market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions. We expect that over the short term our percentage of sales outside the United States may increase as we build up our domestic sales and service teams. Notwithstanding such percentage increase, we expect the sales of tethered aerostats and drones will primarily be to the domestic market customers, primarily to the U.S. government and its agencies, even if such systems are for integration into foreign locations.
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
Our cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of the costs of manufacturing products, procuring finished goods from our third-party manufacturers, third-party logistics and warehousing provider costs, shipping and handling costs and warranty costs. We presently outsource the manufacturing of DragonWave’s microwave products to a single third-party manufacturer, Benchmark, which manufactures our products from its facilities. Cost of goods sold also includes costs associated with supply operations, including personnel-related costs, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, third-party license costs and third-party costs related to the services we provide. Additionally, cost of goods sold does not include any depreciation and amortization expenses as we separate depreciation and amortization expense into its own category within operating expenses.
Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including changes in our supply chain and evolving product mix. The margin profile of our current products and future products will vary depending on operating performance, features, materials, manufacturer and supply chain. Gross margin will vary as a function of changes in pricing due to competitive pressure, our third-party manufacturing, our production costs, costs of shipping and logistics, provision for excess and obsolete inventory and other factors. We expect our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors.
Operating Expenses
We classify our operating expense as research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Personnel costs are the primary component of each of these operating expense categories, which consist of cash-based personnel costs, such as salaries, sales commissions, benefits and bonuses. Additionally, we separate depreciation and amortization expense into its own category.
Research and Development
In addition to personnel-related costs, research and development expense consists of costs associated with the design, development and certification of our products. We generally recognize research and development expense as incurred. Development costs incurred prior to establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development costs to continue to increase as we develop new products and modify existing products to meet the changes within the telecom landscape.
Sales and Marketing
In addition to personnel costs for sales, marketing, service and product management personnel, sales and marketing expense consists of the expenses associated with our training programs, trade shows, marketing programs, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, national and local regulatory approvals of our products, travel, entertainment and recruiting. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales, marketing, service and product management organization in support of our investment in our growth opportunities, whether through the development and rollout of new or modified products or through acquisitions. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase materially in the year ending December 31, 2021 as we ramp up our sales and marketing efforts to correspond to our increased production efforts relating to certain of our telecom products.
General and Administrative
In addition to personnel costs, general and administrative expense consists of professional fees, such as legal, audit, accounting, information technology and consulting fees; share-based compensation; and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our product offerings and expand into new markets. During fiscal 2020, we incurred, and during fiscal 2021 we expect to continue to incur, increases in supporting overhead costs, professional fees, transfer agent fees and expenses; development costs and other expenses related to operating as a public company.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation related to fixed assets such as test equipment, research and development equipment, computer hardware, production fixtures and leasehold improvements, as well as amortization related to definite-lived intangibles.
Interest Expense
Interest expense is comprised of interest expense associated with our secured notes payable, notes payable and senior convertible debentures. The amortization of debt discounts is also recorded as part of interest expense. As many of our debt instruments, were past due at various times during fiscal 2020 and, as a result, were accruing interest at increased interest rates, and as we have been able to refinance our debt or issue equity to reduce our outstanding debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our interest expense is expected to decrease in fiscal 2021 due to lower interest rates on our debt or lower debt balances.
Provision for Income Taxes
Current and deferred income tax expense or benefit in any given period will depend upon a number of events and circumstances, one of which is the income tax net income or loss from operations for the period which is usually different from the U.S. GAAP net income from operations for the period due to differences in tax laws and timing differences. See Note 16 - Income Taxes in the Notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation on U.S. GAAP income or loss and tax income or loss. Management assesses our deferred tax assets in each reporting period, and if it is determined that it is not more likely than not to be realized, we will record a change in our valuation allowance in that period.
Results of Operations
(1) These are exclusive of depreciation and amortization
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to January 10, 2019 (inception) to December 31, 2019
From the date of its incorporation (January 10, 2019) until the date of its first acquisition, as described above, COMSovereign had no business operations. COMSovereign’s entire activity after its inception date through the date of consummation of the COMSovereign Acquisition was limited to the evaluation of and consummation of business acquisition transactions as well as preparatory actions, including manufacturing line readiness and subsidiary integration actions, which impeded the ability of DragonWave to have products manufactured and shipped during the period. For the period January 10, 2019 (Inception) to December 31, 2019, COMSovereign generated only nominal revenues.
Total Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenues increased $4,714,624, or 100%, which were derived primarily from a full year of revenue from mobile network backhaul products, the acquisition of Sovereign Plastics and VNC, the test-market sale of certain high-performance after-market models of our intelligent batteries, and to a lesser extent, from a full year of revenue of our Drone Aviation aerostat products and accessories, which were included in our operating results after November 27, 2019, the date of the COMSovereign Acquisition.
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of goods sold increased $1,605,245, or 54%, which primarily consisted of the increases in payments to our contact manufacturer for the production of our mobile network backhaul products and the materials, parts and labor associated with the manufacturing of our intelligent batteries and plastics, all due directly related to our increase in revenues.
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $3,109,379 with a gross profit margin of 51% compared to 37% for the period January 10, 2019 (Inception) to December 31, 2019. These changes in gross profit margin resulted primarily from the increased gross profit margin of DragonWave during the year and the inclusion of a full year of operating results for Drone Aviation and most of the year for Sovereign Plastics, which were acquired on November 27, 2019 and March 6, 2020, respectively. As described above, for fiscal 2019, COMSovereign generated only nominal revenues. DragonWave’s sales and gross profit margin increased following the preparatory actions performed in 2019, including manufacturing line readiness and subsidiary integration actions.
Research and Development Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expenses increased $1,838,432, or 1,055%. This increase resulted from multiple new technology integration efforts across our subsidiaries, including expenses related to additional contracted engineering services teams and a large conversion of inventory into customer testing.
Sales and Marketing Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales and marketing expenses increased $17,827, or 287% which primarily consisted of increases in payroll and related costs.
General and Administrative Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses increased $3,159,686, or 22%. This increase primarily consisted of increases in payroll and related costs of $4,469,161, bad debt expense of $905,680, rent of $784,729, share-based compensation expense of $454,518 and insurance expense of $ $250,996, which were partially offset by decreases to overhead totaling $334,166 and miscellaneous and professional fees totaling $3,448,317. These increases were due primarily to higher head count, a one-time event bad debt expense, and changes to operations that included additional facilities. The decreases primarily consisted of decreases in administrative activities brought about by adjusting the operations of our subsidiaries, costs related to acquisitions, and legal, accounting and compliance expenses for first year public company costs.
Depreciation and Amortization
For the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $4,964,268, or 66%, due to the commencement of depreciation on test equipment, research and development equipment, computer hardware, production fixtures and leasehold improvements. This increase was driven primarily through the realization of full periods of depreciation and amortization for acquisitions that occurred during 2019 as well as additional acquisitions in the current year.
Other Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, total other expenses increased $1,336,128, or 12%. This increase primarily consisted of an increase of $2,909,480 in interest expense due primarily to the acceleration in the amortization of debt discounts on our outstanding debt, an increase in other expense of $1,221,407 due primarily to the occurrence of various default penalties on outstanding indebtedness, and an increase in foreign currency loss of $266,311 due to standard currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by a decrease of $418,956 in losses on extinguishment of debt and decrease of $2,640,000 in loss on conversion of debt, both due to the reduction of the quantitiy of extinguishments and conversions of debt instruments as compared to the prior year.
Provision for Income Taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2020, deferred tax benefit decreased $1,231,500, or 30%, primarily as a result of changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets driven by the effect of deferred tax liabilities on acquisitions that occurred during 2020.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net loss of $37,081,464 compared to a net loss of $27,545,255 for the period January 10, 2019 (Inception) to December 31, 2019, related to the items described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of December 31, 2020, we had $730,502 in cash compared to $812,452 at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $81,950. As of December 31, 2020, we had $787,333 in accounts receivable compared to $2,168,659 at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,381,326 resulting from increased collections for 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we had total current assets of $7,681,210 and total current liabilities of $34,262,263, or negative working capital of $26,581,053, compared to total current assets of $8,665,369 and total current liabilities of $15,142,599, or negative working capital of $6,477,230 at December 31, 2019. This is a decline of $20,103,823 over the working capital balance at the end of 2019.
Since December 31, 2020, we incurred an additional $18.0 million of indebtedness, repaid an aggregate of $7.6 million of indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2020, including accrued interest thereon, and converted $12.8 million aggregate principal amount of promissory notes outstanding as of December 31, 2020, including accrued interest thereon, to shares of our common stock at a weighted average conversion price of $4.10 per share.
After giving effect to such additional debt issuances, repayments and conversions, as of December 31, 2020, we had undiscounted obligations relating to the payment of indebtedness and past due payroll, accrued liabilities, and accounts payable, exclusive of interest, due and payable on or prior to December 31, 2021 as follows:
● $10,144,622 related to payroll, accrued liabilities and accounts payable that were past due;
● $5,904,158 related to secured notes payable that were past due;
● $7,766,037 related to notes payable that were past due;
● $84,000 related to senior debentures that were past due;
● $2,612,376 related to convertible notes that were past due;
● $1,250,000 related to senior convertible debentures that were past due;
● $1,723,341 related to indebtedness that is due in the first quarter of 2021;
● $23,641 related to indebtedness that is due in the second quarter of 2021;
● $23,956 related to indebtedness that is due in the third quarter of 2021; and
● $24,276 related to indebtedness that is due in the fourth quarter of 2021.
In January and February 2021, we completed two public offerings of our equity securities in which we received aggregate net proceeds of $39.7 million, after payment of all offering expenses. We applied approximately $7.6 million of such net proceeds to repay debt and interest and approximately $9.4 million to pay accounts payable and accrued liabilities and payroll costs outstanding at December 31, 2020. In addition, we converted or exchanged debt and interest for equity totaling approximately $12.8 million. As a result, our remaining indebtedness that is payable on or prior to December 31, 2021 that was outstanding at December 31, 2020 is approximately $4.5 million and is made up primarily of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and debt that is not past due.
We anticipate meeting our cash obligations on our remaining indebtedness that is payable on or prior to December 31, 2021 from the net proceeds of our public offerings in January and February of 2021, earnings from operations, including, in particular, the operations of DragonWave, VNC and Drone Aviation, and possibly from the proceeds of additional indebtedness or equity raises.
Our future capital requirements for our operations will depend on many factors, including the profitability of our businesses, the number and cash requirements of other acquisition candidates that we pursue, and the costs of our operations. We have been investing in research and development in anticipation of increasing revenue opportunities in our cellular network solutions business, which has contributed to our losses from operations.
We plan to generate positive cash flow from our recently-completed acquisitions to address some of our liquidity needs. However, to execute our business plan, service our existing indebtedness, finance our proposed acquisitions and implement our business strategy, we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional financing from time to time and may choose to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit, borrowings from affiliates or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our current stockholders’ ownership in us and could also result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. The terms of those securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Furthermore, any debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed, to continue operations in their current form. The report of our independent registered public accountants on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, stated that our losses, negative cash flows from operations, limited capital resources and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We had capital expenditures of $176,697 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and of $87,038 in fiscal 2019. We expect our capital expenditures for next 12 months will be consistent with our prior spending. These capital expenditures will be primarily utilized for equipment needed to generate revenue and for office equipment. We expect to fund such capital expenditures out of our working capital.
Line of Credit and Debt Agreements
Line of Credit
In 2017, we issued a promissory note (the “CNB Note”) to City National Bank of Florida (“CNB”) in the principal amount of $2,000,000. Through various amendments, the CNB Note had a maturity date of August 2, 2020 and allowed for a CNB line of credit with advances that could have been requested until the maturity date of August 2, 2020 so long as no event of default existed under the CNB Note or certain other events.
The CNB Note bore an interest rate equal to the average of the interest rates per annum at which U.S. dollars were offered in the London Interbank Borrowing Market (“LIBOR”) for a 30-day period (the “Index”) plus 2.9 percentage points over the Index. A late charge of 5.0% of any monthly payment not received by CNB within 10 calendar days after its due date would have been charged. Prepayment of the CNB Note was allowed at any time without penalty. In the event of a default, the interest rate would increase to the highest lawful rate. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the CNB Note is 4.6% per annum.
We and our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Nussbaum, were obligated to maintain a minimum average annual balance of $1,600,000 in the aggregate with CNB. In the event we did not maintain this account balance, CNB could charge us a fee equal to 2% of the deficiency as additional interest under the CNB Note. The CNB Note was personally guaranteed by Mr. Nussbaum and his estate, who along with us were obligated to maintain an aggregate unencumbered liquidity of no less than $6,000,000. In addition, the CNB Note was secured by all of Drone Aviation’s accounts, inventory and equipment along with an assignment of a $120,000 bank account that we maintained at CNB. As of December 31, 2019, $2,000,000 was drawn against the CNB line of credit.
As discussed below, on March 19, 2020, we issued a promissory note to the estate of Mr. Nussbaum in the principal amount of $2,007,971, the proceeds of which, were used to repay the balance of the CNB Note.
Secured Notes Payable
In August 2016, InduraPower issued a promissory note not to exceed the principal amount of $550,000 bearing interest at 8.5% per annum with a maturity date of August 31, 2018. InduraPower could draw funds under the note through February 28, 2017. Interest on this note was payable monthly and the full principal balance was due at maturity. On September 11, 2019, the note was amended and both parties agreed that the outstanding balance of $813,709 would be due on February 28, 2020. This promissory note was secured by substantially all of the assets of InduraPower. As of December 31, 2020, an aggregate principal amount of $788,709 was outstanding under this note. This promissory note was past due and accrued interest at an increased default rate of 12.5% per annum. This note, and all related accrued interest, was repaid in January 2021.
In August 2016, InduraPower issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $450,000 that bears interest at 9.0% per annum and matures on March 1, 2022. Accrued interest only payments were due monthly beginning October 1, 2016 through March 1, 2017. Monthly payments of $9,341 for interest and principal are due on this note for the following 60 consecutive months. This promissory note is secured by all assets, certain real estate and cash accounts of InduraPower and is guaranteed by certain officers of InduraPower. As of December 31, 2020, an aggregate principal amount of $150,710 was outstanding under this note.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for our evaluation of accounting standards not yet adopted.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes. In preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. Preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem “critical.”
Accounts Receivable and Credit Policies
Trade accounts receivable consist of amounts due from the sale of our products and services. Such accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 to 45 days of receipt of the invoice. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2020, we characterized $1,686,731 as uncollectible.
Beneficial Conversion Features and Warrants
We evaluate the conversion feature of convertible debt instruments to determine whether the conversion feature is beneficial as described in ASC 470-30, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. We record a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) related to the issuance of convertible debt that has conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates that are in-the-money when issued and record the relative fair value of any warrants issued with those instruments. The BCF for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrants and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features, both of which are credited to additional paid-in capital. We calculate the fair value of warrants with the convertible instruments using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires various inputs such as the annualized volatility of our stock, stock price and annual risk-free rate of return. As COMSovereign was a private company for most of 2019, in determining the BCF related to the convertible debt of COMSovereign and its subsidiaries in fiscal 2019, we had to rely on factors outside the public markets for the inputs. If different inputs were used or different judgments were made, the results could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
Under these guidelines, we first allocate the value of the proceeds received from a convertible debt transaction between the convertible debt instrument and any other detachable instruments included in the transaction (such as warrants) on a relative fair value basis. A BCF is then measured as the intrinsic value of the conversion option at the commitment date, representing the difference between the effective conversion price and our stock price on the commitment date multiplied by the number of shares into which the debt instrument is convertible. The allocated value of the BCF and warrants are recorded as a debt discount and accreted over the expected term of the convertible debt as interest expense. If the intrinsic value of the BCF is greater than the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt instrument, the amount of the discount assigned to the BCF is limited to the amount of the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt instrument.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and requires entities to recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The principles in the standard are applied in five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We adopted Topic 606 as of January 10, 2019 (date of inception).
Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five-step framework. Understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time, amount and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires judgment. These significant judgments include: (1) determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer; (2) applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time; and (3) estimating how and when contingencies, or other forms of variable consideration, will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue. The timing and revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made.
Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment, Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. This accounting standard requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The adoption of this standard had no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Assumptions must be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist. Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, tax rates and remaining useful lives. These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded. Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities. Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
Share-Based Compensation
We account for share-based compensation costs in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires companies to measure the cost of awards of equity instruments, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the employee’s requisite service period or the non-employee’s vesting period. An employee’s requisite service period is the period of time over which an employee must provide service in exchange for an award under a share-based payment arrangement and generally is presumed to be the vesting period.
In determining the grant date fair value of share-based awards, we must estimate the expected volatility, forfeitures and performance attributes. Since share-based compensation expense can be material to our financial condition, different assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
