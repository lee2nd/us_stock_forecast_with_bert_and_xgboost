Overview and Executive Summary
Agilent Technologies Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Both our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. During the year ended October 31, 2021, many businesses and countries, including the U.S., continued applying preventative and precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the virus including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations.
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. We enacted safety measures, including social distancing protocols, encouraging employees to work from home when possible, suspending non-essential work travel, implementing various access controls at our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities. As COVID-19 conditions improved, we began implementing a phased reopening process, required our U.S. employees to be fully vaccinated pursuant to federal, state and local guidelines and continued to prioritize health and safety. We expect to continue to implement appropriate safety measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is contained. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Currently, most of our employees are still working from home. When we determine it is safe for our employees to return to the office, we will be moving towards a hybrid work model, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at our onsite locations.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak, new variants, the effectiveness of health and safety measures including vaccines, managing the different pace of return-to-office in different locations, the pace and strength of the economic recovery, and supply chain pressures, among others. We will continue to actively monitor the effects of the pandemic and will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the impacts to our employees and on our business results.
Despite the economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we ended our fiscal year 2021 with revenue growth of 18 percent year over year. This revenue growth was primarily non-COVID related revenue and came from all of our segments, key end markets and geographies. Revenue growth was also partly due to weakened sales in the prior year as the response to the early stages of the pandemic caused many of our customers to close or reduce operating capacity. In fiscal year 2021, our overall business performance was strong which also resulted in significant expense increases from our variable pay and long-term performance plan-earnings per share ("LTPP-EPS") programs, along with sales commission increases year over year, which was partially offset by the continued cost savings actions which included reduction in travel and non-essential spending that we implemented last year.
Acquisition
On April 15, 2021 we completed the acquisition of privately-owned Resolution Bioscience, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of next-generation sequencing-based ("NGS") precision oncology solutions, for $561 million cash plus potential future contingent payments of up to $145 million upon the achievement of certain milestones which are based on certain revenue and technical targets. Resolution Bioscience complements and expands our capabilities in NGS-based cancer diagnostics within our diagnostics and genomics segment and provides us with innovative technology to further serve the needs of the fast-growing precision medicine market. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of October 31, 2021 was $89 million which included a decrease of $21 million from the estimated fair value as of the end of our third quarter.
2022 Senior Notes
On January 21, 2021, we redeemed $100 million of the $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2022 senior notes due October 1, 2022. On April 5, 2021, we redeemed the remaining outstanding $300 million of our 2022 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $417 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2022 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $17 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, $1 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid. The make-whole premium less partial amortization of previously deferred interest rate swap gain together with the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount was recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
2031 Senior Notes
On March 12, 2021, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $850 million in senior notes ("2031 senior notes"). The 2031 senior notes were issued at 99.822% of their principal amount. The 2031 senior notes will mature on March 12, 2031, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.30% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 12th and September 12th of each year and payments commenced on September 12, 2021.
Actual Results
Agilent's net revenue of $6,319 million in 2021 increased 18 percent when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements for 2021 had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points when compared to 2020. Net revenue increased in all business segments, geographic regions and key end markets. The favorable impact of COVID-related revenue and revenue from our recent acquisition for the year ended October 31, 2021 was not material. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 18 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 24 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 3 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 16 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020.
Agilent's net revenue of $5,339 million increased 3 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. Foreign currency movements for 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 1 percentage point when compared to 2019. In 2020, acquisitions from 2019 had an overall favorable impact of 3 percentage points when compared to 2019. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 4 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. In 2020 acquisitions from 2019 had an overall favorable impact of 7 percentage points when compared to 2019. Foreign currency movements had no overall
impact on revenue growth in 2020 when compared to 2019. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 2 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 1 percentage point in 2020 when compared to 2019. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 3 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 1 percentage point in 2020 when compared to 2019.
Net income was $1,210 million in 2021 compared to net income of $719 million and $1,071 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net income in 2021 was impacted by higher sales volume and net gains on fair value of equity securities partially offset by significant expense increases from our variable pay, share-based compensation expense and sales commissions. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2020 was impacted by revenue declines in certain of our businesses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and increased costs and expenses which included an impairment charge of $98 million related to the closure of our sequencer development program. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2019 was impacted by a discrete tax benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company's tax incentives in Singapore. As of October 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,484 million and $1,441 million, respectively.
On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2019 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended October 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $723 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired 5.2 million shares for $469 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired approximately 3.1 million shares for $365 million under this authorization. Effective February 18, 2021, the 2019 repurchase program was terminated and replaced by the new share repurchase program. The remaining authorization under the 2019 repurchase plan of $193 million expired on February 18, 2021.
On February 16, 2021 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2021 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2021 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2021 repurchase program which became effective on February 18, 2021, replaced and terminated the 2019 repurchase program on that date. The 2021 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired 3.0 million shares for $423 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2021, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately $1.577 billion of our common stock under the 2021 repurchase program.
During the year ended October 31, 2021, cash dividends of 0.776 per share, or $236 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2020, cash dividends of 0.720 per share, or $222 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2019, cash dividends of 0.656 per share, or $206 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock.
On November 17, 2021 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.210 per share of common stock, or approximately $63 million which will be paid on January 26, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 4, 2022. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.
Looking forward, as we continue to navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers and community, as well as supporting our customers' operations. We expect to face additional logistical pressures, such as longer lead times and limited sources of supply in the near term that we will continue to mitigate through various sourcing strategies. We also remain focused on improving our customers’ experience, differentiating product solutions and productivity. We continue supporting our customers' needs related to the development of new therapies and vaccines. With our strong results in fiscal year 2021 and the continued recovery in our end markets, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities in all of our end markets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue Recognition. On November 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606").
We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.
We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.
Service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.
We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.
Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling
prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.
A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842") beginning in 2020 and ASC 840, Leases ("ASC 840") for prior periods. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables, the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas the revenue associated with the consumables, the non-lease component, is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard.
Inventory Valuation. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2021 and 2020, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2021, discount rates for the U.S. retiree medical plans increased marginally compared to the previous year due to the increase in the corporate bond rates. For 2021 and 2020, the discount rates for non-U.S. plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2021, increased marginally compared to the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million in U.S. pension expense and $18 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.
The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.
In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans were approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments as of October 31, 2020 and were changed to approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments as of October 31, 2021. Our Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 15 percent to 60 percent to equities, from 38 percent to 85 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2021 and 2020 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.
Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships.
The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $5 million on U.S. pension expense and $10 milion on non-U.S. pension expense. The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $24 million expense in 2021, $22 million expense in 2020 and $10 million expense in 2019. The years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020 included a loss on settlement of $1 million and $4 million, respectively.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.
The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.
If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.
In fiscal year 2021, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2021, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development ("IPR&D") acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2021. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. During the year ended October 31, 2021 and 2019 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
Adoption of New Pronouncements
See Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
Foreign Currency
Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2021 had an overall favorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2020, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 1 percentage point when compared to 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue, they will also have a negative impact by increasing our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling thirteen-month period). We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.

Income Taxes
For 2021, our income tax expense was $150 million with an effective tax rate of 11 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2021, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the discrete benefit of $93 million related to the release of tax reserves in various jurisdictions due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2021 also include the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $29 million.
For 2020, our income tax expense was $123 million with an effective tax rate of 14.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2020, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates.
For 2019, our income tax benefit was $152 million with an effective tax rate of (16.5) percent. For the year ended October 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.
We have negotiated a tax holiday in Singapore. The tax holiday provides a lower rate of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. As a result of the incentive, the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by $35 million, $71 million, and $368 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.11, $0.23, and $1.16 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of the $1.16 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) in 2019, $0.94 of the benefit relates to one-time items from the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.
With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 1 percentage point in 2020 when compared to 2019. Geographically, revenue was flat in the Americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, increased 2 percent in Europe with a 1 percentage point favorable currency impact and increased 7 percent in Asia Pacific with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact. As a consequence of the COVID-19 related impact on global commerce in 2020, consumable sales growth has been low single digits in comparison to 2019 in most countries excluding China. In addition, the COVID-19 related customer site closures have brought a temporary lull in our delivery of on-demand services and installation services, which has been recovering in the latter half of the year as customer labs reopen. Consumable sales in China and the contracted service business across most regions have seen solid gains throughout 2020. Among our major end markets, the pharmaceutical market and the food market generated the strongest revenue growth when compared to 2019.
Looking forward, the Agilent CrossLab products and services are well positioned to continue their success in our key end markets and with a growing installed base of instruments to support. We have been taking advantage of digital and remote capabilities to offer services and consumables to customers and will continue to do so. Geographically, the business is well diversified across all regions to take advantage of local market opportunities and to hedge against weakness in any one region.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin
The following table shows the Agilent CrossLab business' margins, expenses and income from operations for 2021 versus 2020 and 2020 versus 2019.
Gross margin for products and services was flat in 2021 when compared to 2020. Higher volumes and targeted price increases did help elevate margins, but those benefits were offset by higher service delivery costs, higher variable pay and higher hedging losses. Gross margin for products and services was relatively flat in 2020 when compared to 2019. Gross margin benefited from lower service delivery costs which included travel, parts and labor as well as improved productivity in manufacturing in the consumables business. Those operational gains were offset by a net unfavorable impact from currency movements.
Research and development expenses increased 5 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Research and development investment within the Agilent CrossLab business increased due to higher wages and a continued focus on digital service offerings. Research and development expenses were relatively flat in 2020 when compared to 2019. The higher wages and
variable pay in research and development expenses were offset by lower travel costs and the reduction of other discretionary expenditures.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher wages and variable pay, sales commissions and share-based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to favorable currency movements, reduced travel and training by the sales organization, lower sales commissions, and a reduction in discretionary expenditures which were partially offset by higher wages.
Operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2021 when compared to 2020. Operating margin grew slightly in 2021 due to higher sales volume offset by higher wages and variable pay, higher service delivery costs and hedging losses. Operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2020 when compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to the growth in revenue while lowering service delivery and selling costs and the reduction of discretionary expenditures, partially offset by higher wages.
Income from Operations
Income from operations in 2021 increased by $102 million or 20 percent when compared to 2020 on a revenue increase of $300 million. Income from operations increased primarily due to higher sales. Income from operations in 2020 increased by $41 million or 9 percent when compared to 2019 on a revenue increase of $60 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth in revenue while lowering service delivery and selling costs and the reduction of discretionary expenditures, partially offset by higher wages.
Financial Condition
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially impacted by COVID-19 to date. We have not identified any material liquidity concerns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results.
Economic stimulus legislation was passed in many countries in response to COVID-19. In March 2020 in the U.S., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was enacted to provide for tax relief and government loans, subsidies and other relief for entities in affected industries. In March 2021 in the U.S., the American Rescue Plan Act ("ARP Act") was enacted. The ARP Act strengthens and extends certain federal programs enacted through the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief measures and establishes new federal programs. As of October 31, 2021, the CARES Act, the ARP Act and other government benefits outside the U.S. did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Our financial position as of October 31, 2021 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1,484 million as compared to $1,441 million as of October 31, 2020.
We may, from time to time, retire certain outstanding debt of ours through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,485 million in 2021 as compared to $921 million provided in 2020 and $1,021 million provided in 2019. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $211 million in 2021 compared to income taxes paid of $361 million, which included a one-time payment of $231 million related to the transfer of intellectual property, in 2020 and $159 million in 2019. For the years ended October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, other assets and liabilities used cash of $14 million, $182 million and $40 million, respectively. The cash outflow for the year ended October 31, 2021 in other assets and liabilities was primarily due to tax payments and changes in deferred revenue. The cash outflow in the year ended October 31, 2020 was largely the result of increased income tax payments, interest payments on senior notes and changes in deferred revenue. Cash outflow for the year ended October 31, 2019 in other assets and liabilities is primarily due to tax payments and interest on senior notes.
In 2021, the change in accounts receivable used cash of $128 million, $107 million in 2020, and $106 million in 2019. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 64 days in 2021, 63 days in 2020 and 61 days in 2019. The change in accounts payable provided cash of $64 million in 2021, $2 million in 2020 and $29 million in 2019. Cash used in inventory was $136 million in 2021, $68 million in 2020 and $36 million in 2019. Inventory days on-hand increased to 98 days in 2021 compared to 93 days in 2020 and increased compared to 97 days in 2019. In the year ended October 31, 2021, we increased our inventory levels to meet our customer needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to compensate for long lead time in ordering from our suppliers.
The change in the employee compensation and benefits liability was $112 million for year ended October 31, 2021 compared to cash provided of $29 million in 2020 and $23 million in 2019. This was largely due to an increase in the vacation liability and variable and incentive pay liability. We paid approximately $119 million in 2021 under our variable and incentive pay programs compared to $79 million in 2020 and $118 million in 2019. The decrease in the amount for variable and incentive pay programs paid in 2020 was primarily due to changes made for certain incentive pay programs which were paid annually versus semi-annually as was done in 2019.
We made no contributions to our U.S defined benefit plans in 2021, 2020 and 2019. We contributed $19 million in 2021 and $31 million in 2020 and $21 million 2019 to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, respectively. We did not contribute to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. The increase in 2020 mainly related to $12 million additional contribution in the Netherlands. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2022. We expect to contribute $19 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2022.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 was $749 million and in 2020 was $147 million as compared to net cash used of $1,590 million in 2019.
Investments in property, plant and equipment were $188 million in 2021, $119 million in 2020 and $155 million in 2019. Our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 will be $300 million. In 2021 we invested $546 million in a business and intangible assets, net of cash acquired for our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience compared to no acquisitions in 2020 and $1,408 million invested in our acquisition of two businesses in 2019. In 2021 cash used to purchase fair value investments was $22 million compared to $20 million outlay in 2020 and $23 million in 2019.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities in 2021 was $696 million compared to $717 million in 2020 and $299 million in 2019.
Treasury Stock Repurchases
On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2019 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended October 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $723 million under this
authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired 5.2 million shares for $469 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired approximately 3.1 million shares for $365 million under this authorization. Effective February 18, 2021, the 2019 repurchase program was terminated and replaced by the new share repurchase program. The remaining authorization under the 2019 repurchase plan of $193 million expired on February 18, 2021.
On February 16, 2021 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2021 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2021 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2021 repurchase program which became effective on February 18, 2021, replaced and terminated the 2019 repurchase program on that date. The 2021 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired 3.0 million shares for $423 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2021, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately $1.577 billion of our common stock under the 2021 repurchase program.
Dividends
For the years ended October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 cash dividends of $236 million, $222 million and $206 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 17, 2021 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.210 per share of common stock, or approximately $63 million which will be paid on January 26, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 4, 2022. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.
Credit Facilities
On March 13, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which, as amended, provides for a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024 and incremental term loan facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $500 million. On April 21, 2021, we entered into an incremental assumption agreement, pursuant to which the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility was increased to $1.35 billion and the aggregate amount available for incremental facilities was refreshed to remain at $500 million. As of both October 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we had no borrowings under the incremental facilities. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the year ended October 31, 2021.
Commercial Paper
In May 2020, we established a U.S. commercial paper program, under which the company may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.0 billion with up to 397-day maturities. On June 18, 2021, we increased the authorized maximum amount of notes that may be outstanding to $1.35 billion. At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under its revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program. We had borrowings of $75 million outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program as of October 31, 2020.
Long-term Debt
2022 Senior Notes
On September 13, 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes ("2022 senior notes"). The 2022 senior notes were issued at 99.80% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 1, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year and payments commenced on April 1, 2013.
On January 21, 2021, we redeemed $100 million of the $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2022 senior notes due October 1, 2022. On April 5, 2021, we redeemed the remaining outstanding $300 million of our 2022 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $417 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2022 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $17 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, $1 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid. The make-whole premium less partial amortization of previously deferred interest rate swap gain together with the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount was recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
2023 Senior Notes
On June 21, 2013, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2023 senior notes"). The 2023 senior notes were issued at 99.544% of their principal amount.

The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million, and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2021 was $5 million.
2029 Senior Notes
On September 16, 2019, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2029 senior notes"). The 2029 senior notes were issued at 99.316% of their principal amount.

We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 6, 2019 and we recognized a deferred loss of $6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2029 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2021 was $5 million.

The interest is payable semi-annually on March 12th and September 12th of each year and payments commenced on September 12, 2021.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other
Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
Contractual Commitments
Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2021 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions):
Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
Other Purchase Commitments. We have categorized "other purchase commitments" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under "other purchase commitments" were approximately $83 million. Approximately $22 million of the penalties for the new contracts will reduce over the next 12 years.
Retirement Plans. Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen.
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2021 or October 31, 2020.
On Balance Sheet Arrangements
The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2021 balance sheet (in millions):
Other long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020 include $241 million and $323 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. Of these amounts, $117 million and $199 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. The remaining $124 million included in other long-term liabilities relates to the one-time transition tax payable.
