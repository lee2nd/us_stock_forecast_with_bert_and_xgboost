Net Sales
When calculating the percentage change in comparable store sales, the Company defines a new store to be comparable when it has been in operation after five full quarters. Relocated stores and stores with expanded square footage are included in comparable store sales since these units are located in existing markets and are open during construction. Planned store dispositions are excluded from the calculation. The Company only includes retail food stores in the calculation.

Results of Operations (continued)
Net Sales (continued)
According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ report, the annual Seasonally Adjusted Food-at-Home Consumer Price Index increased 0.2% in 2020, 0.9% in 2019 and 0.7% in 2018. Even though the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ index rates may be reflective of a trend, it will not necessarily be indicative of the Company’s actual results. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the 52-week average price of gasoline in the Central Atlantic States decreased 12.8%, or $0.36 per gallon, in 2020 compared to the 52-week average in 2019. The 52-week average price of gasoline in the Central Atlantic States, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, decreased 5.7%, or $0.17 per gallon, in 2019 compared to the 52-week average in 2018.
Comparable store sales increased for all years presented. On a comparable store sales basis all product categories, Center Store, Fresh and Pharmacy Services, with the exception of Fuel, increased in sales. The Company’s 2020 sales were favorably impacted as a result of increased sales demand related to the novel coronavirus pandemic as well as increasing market share. The Company has provided additional product offerings and customer conveniences such as “Weis 2 Go Online,” currently offered at 184 store locations. “Weis 2 Go Online” allows the customer to order on-line and have their order delivered or pick up their order at an expedient store drive-thru.
Although the Company experienced retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the years presented, management cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the types of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors. Management remains confident in its ability to generate sales growth in a highly competitive environment, but also understands some competitors have greater financial resources and could use these resources to take measures which could adversely affect the Company's competitive position.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales consists of direct product costs (net of discounts and allowances), net advertising costs, distribution center and transportation costs, as well as manufacturing facility operations. Increased sales volume resulted in an increase in cost of sales. Both direct product cost and distribution cost increase when sales volume increases.
Gross profit rate was 26.8% in 2020, 26.5% in 2019 and 26.6% in 2018. The increase in gross profit rate is attributable to a change in sales mix along with increased fresh department sell-through during the novel coronavirus pandemic, reducing the amount of product loss. Pharmacy gross profit margin continues to be pressured by recent changes in industry practices. The Company cannot predict whether the pharmacy industry practices will change favorably.
The Company experienced favorable non-cash LIFO inventory valuation adjustments, increasing gross profit by $275 thousand, $5.8 million and $1.5 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Although the Company experienced product cost inflation and deflation in various commodities in 2020, 2019 and 2018, management cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the types of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors.

Operating, General and Administrative Expenses
The majority of the expenses were driven by increased sales volume.
Employee-related costs such as wages, employer paid taxes, health care benefits and retirement plans, comprise approximately 62.7% of the total “Operating, general and administrative expenses.” During the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Company compensated its employees, primarily front-line associates over $32.5 million in various rewards, including an additional $2 per hour for 15 weeks. As a percent of sales, direct store labor decreased 0.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 and decreased 0.1% in 2019 compared to 2018. While direct store labor expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, the sales increases have outpaced the labor expense increase causing the rate to fall, primarily due to the fixed component of store labor. Management continues to monitor store labor efficiencies and develop labor standards to reduce costs while maintaining the Company’s customer service expectations. Currently, the Company is continuing a multi-year initiative to install or upgrade self-checkouts in its stores in response to customer preference and labor rates and supply, including adding convertible dual-use checkout lanes.
The Company’s self-insured health care benefit expenses increased by 9.8% in 2020 compared to 2019 and increased by 1.0% in 2019 compared to 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense charged to “Operating, general and administrative expenses” was $90.2 million, or 2.2% of net sales, for 2020 compared to $85.2 million, or 2.4% of net sales, for 2019 and $84.4 million, or 2.4% of net sales, for 2018. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales decreased 0.2% in 2020 when compared to 2019, however when 2019 is compared to 2018 there was no change. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further information regarding the Company’s capital expansion program.
Fixed expenses include occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization and insurance expenses. Although fixed expenses have increased from a cost perspective, the increase in sales has caused a decrease in the percent of sales rate.
The majority of the operating, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales presented for the fiscal year 2020 have benefited in comparison with the 2019 percent of sales due to the increase in sales caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic. Due to the nature of fixed expenses, management expects less variability when analyzed as a percent of sales, relative to the majority of operating, general and administrative expenses.
All expenses as a percent of sales presented for the 2019 fiscal year have benefited in comparison with the 2018 percent of sales due to the closure of unprofitable stores. The Company is benefiting from cost saving initiatives in various areas of its operations and is saving in utilities with a combination of purchasing, associate sustainability and capital investments such as its LED lighting program.

Provision for Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 27.3%, 23.3% and 23.6% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes as well as nondeductible employee expenses. Not all the Company’s tax credits and state deductions are driven proportionately by taxable income levels, due to these items and the significant increase in taxable income from prior years, the result was a higher effective income tax rate for 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The primary source of cash is cash flows generated from operations. In addition, the Company has access to a revolving credit agreement entered into on September 1, 2016, and amended on August 21, 2019, with Wells Fargo Bank, NA (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement matures on September 1, 2022 and provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30.0 million with an additional discretionary amount available of $70.0 million. As of December 26, 2020, the availability under the revolving credit agreement was $25.1 million with $4.9 million of letters of credit outstanding. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company.
﻿
The Company’s investment portfolio consists of high-grade bonds with maturity dates between one and 10 years and three long-held high yield, large capitalized public company equity securities. The portfolio totaled $111.9 million as of December 26, 2020. Management anticipates maintaining the investment portfolio, but has the ability to liquidate if needed. See “
