Item 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.
Forward-Looking Statements
The following discussion may contain statements that are not purely historical. Such statements contained herein or as may otherwise be incorporated by reference herein constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements regarding anticipated operating results, future earnings, and the ability to achieve growth and profitability. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (including its duration and severity) and governmental actions in response thereto; the effect of foreign political unrest; domestic and foreign government policies and economic conditions; future changes in export laws or regulations; changes in technology; the ability to hire, retain and motivate technical, management and sales personnel; the risks associated with the technical feasibility and market acceptance of new products; changes in telecommunications protocols; the effects of changing costs, exchange rates and interest rates; and the Company's ability to secure adequate capital resources.

For a more detailed discussion of the risks facing the Company, see the Company’s filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 and the “Risk Factors” section included herein.
Impact of COVID-19 Coronavirus
As a result of the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a noticeable delay in the receipt of customer orders. While we remain in contact with our customers and their requirements have not changed, the operations of certain of our customers have been slowed or shut down entirely. Our suppliers thus far have been able to timely deliver components and parts necessary for the manufacture and production of the Company’s products to fulfill orders, although we cannot be sure this trend will continue. It is uncertain how long our customers’ operations will be impacted, and those of our suppliers and our ability to respond to customer requirements and supplier issues will become more challenging during a period of sustained disruption. Any period of sustained disruption would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation”, to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, receivable reserves, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, fair value and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences may be material.
Results of Operations
Year ended September 25, 2021 compared to year ended September 26, 2020
Net Revenue
Net revenue for the years ended September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was $1,866,000 and $4,108,000, respectively, a decrease of $2,242,000 or 55%. Revenue for fiscal 2021 consisted of $1,630,000, or 87%, from domestic sources and $237,000, or 13%, from international customers as compared to fiscal 2020, in which revenue consisted of $2,876,000, or 70%, from domestic sources and $1,232,000, or 30%, from international customers. International revenues continued to be impacted by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Foreign revenue consisted of shipments to four countries during the year ended September 25, 2021 and two countries during the year ended September 26, 2020. A sale is attributed to a foreign country based on the location of the contracting party. Domestic revenue may include the sale of products shipped through domestic resellers or manufacturers to international destinations. The table below summarizes our principal foreign revenue by country:
For the year ended September 25, 2021, revenue was derived from sales of our engineering services amounting to $1,107,000 and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors and various accessories to one north African country amounting to $148,000 and three domestic customers for deployment into a Middle Eastern country amounting to $270,000, for deployment into a North African country amounting to $98,000 and for deployment into Afghanistan amounting to $77,000, and shipments of our internet protocol data encryptors amounting to $19,000.
For the year ended September 26, 2020, revenue was derived primarily from shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors and various accessories to two domestic customers for deployment into a Middle Eastern country amounting to $1,809,000 and for deployment into a North African country amounting to $149,000. In addition, we made shipments of our internet protocol data encryptors to four customers in a Middle Eastern country amounting to $1,228,000, including certain upgrades and training. We also had sales of our engineering services amounting to $913,000.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for fiscal 2021 was $557,000, compared to gross profit of $2,385,000 for fiscal 2020, a decrease of 77%. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was 30% for fiscal 2021 compared to 58% for fiscal 2020, which lower gross profit percentage for 2021 was due to the lower margin engineering services revenue during such year. During fiscal 2020, there was a higher concentration of revenue related to product sales, which historically yield higher margins.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 were $1,842,000, compared to $2,226,000 for fiscal 2020. This decrease of $384,000, or 17%, was attributable to a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $109,000 and a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $275,000 during the 2021 fiscal year.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 25, 2021 was primarily attributable to decreases in payroll and payroll-related expenses of $86,000, director fees of $12,000 and audit costs of $7,000.
The decrease in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended September 25, 2021 was attributable to decreases in outside commissions of $153,000, internal commission costs of $112,000, product demonstration costs of $60,000 and in payroll and payroll-related expenses of $13,000. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in engineering sales support of $70,000.
Product Development Costs
Product development costs for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were $732,000 and $1,069,000, respectively. This decrease of $337,000, or 32%, was attributable to a decrease in payroll and payroll-related expenses of $249,000 and an increase in billable engineering services contracts during fiscal 2021 that resulted in decreased product development costs of $165,000, which was partially offset by increases in engineering project costs of $77,000 during the period.
The Company actively sells its engineering services in support of funded research and development. The receipt of these orders is sporadic, although such programs can span over several months to several years. In addition to these programs, the Company invests in research and development to enhance its existing products or to develop new products, as it deems appropriate. There was $1,107,000 of billable engineering services revenue generated during fiscal 2021 and $913,000 of billable engineering services revenue generated during fiscal 2020.
Net (Loss) Income
The Company generated a net loss of $1,088,000 for fiscal 2021, compared to a net loss of $911,000 for fiscal 2020. This increase in net loss is primarily attributable to a 77% decrease in gross profit during fiscal 2021, partially offset by a 22% decrease in operating expenses and the forgiveness of two PPP loans amounting to $949,000.
The effects of inflation and changing costs have not had a significant impact on revenue or earnings in recent years. As of September 25, 2021, none of the Company’s monetary assets or liabilities was subject to foreign exchange risks. The Company usually includes an inflation factor in its pricing when negotiating multi-year contracts with customers.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash and cash equivalents at September 25, 2021 totaled $298,000.
Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
For the year ended September 25, 2021, the Company generated a net loss of $1,088,000. For the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020, the Company generated a net loss of $911,000 and, although the company generated $631,000 of net income in the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, the Company suffered recurring losses from operations during the prior seven year period from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2018. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $4,154,000 at September 25, 2021. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Such consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company was able to secure funding for operations in the form of a line of credit extended by Carl H. Guild, Jr., TCC’s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board. Mr. Guild agreed to loan up to $1 million to the Company pursuant to a demand promissory note dated May 6, 2021 for working capital purposes. The note bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum and has no specified term. On November 18, 2021 the line of credit was amended and restated to increase the amount of the line to $2 million. Advances beyond the initial $1 million will bear interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum. The outstanding principal balance at September 25, 2021 was $1,000,000, plus accrued interest of $13,195.
Also during the second quarter, on March 15, 2021, the Company ended its furlough plan instituted in December 2020 and all employees returned to work on a full time basis following the Company’s receipt of the proceeds of its second PPP loan, described below. During the furlough, the Company had reduced the workweek for the majority of salaried employees to 24 hours and reduced salaries commensurately.
We anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity, including the recent line of credit, will be sufficient to fund our activities through March 2022. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations beyond that point, we will need to secure new customer contracts, raise additional equity or debt capital, and reduce expenses, including payroll and payroll-related expenses through another employee furlough and/or separations.
In order to have sufficient capital resources to fund operations, the Company has been working diligently to secure several large orders with new and existing customers. The receipt of these orders has been significantly delayed and will continue to be difficult to predict due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers as a result of their operations being reduced or shut down. TCC has been able to maintain its operations during this sustained period of disruption, but a continuation of the disruption in either our customers’ operations or those of the Company will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales activity and revenue.
Since the start of the pandemic, the Company has been able to secure capital in the form of debt financing to assist with funding its operations. On April 17, 2020, the Company was granted a loan from bankHometown under the U.S. Small Business Administration's, or SBA, Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, in the principal amount of $474,400. The loan, which was evidenced by a note dated April 17, 2020, was payable over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 1% to the extent not forgiven. The Company used the entire original PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the SBA forgave the loan in its entirety on January 11, 2021.
On February 1, 2021, the Company received a second loan from bankHometown under the PPP as authorized under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, or the Economic Aid Act. The loan, evidenced by a promissory note, was in the principal amount of $474,405. The Company used the entire second PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the loan was forgiven on August 10, 2021 under the provisions of the Economic Aid Act.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company was granted a loan from the SBA in the principal amount of $150,000 pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. This loan is payable monthly over 30 years at an annual interest rate of 3.75% commencing two years from the date of issuance.
The Company is working diligently to secure additional capital through equity or debt arrangements in addition to the recent funding received from the SBA and Mr. Guild. The Company is actively working with equity investors as well as debt investors, such as the SBA and Mr. Guild to secure additional funding, although we cannot provide assurances we will be able to secure such new funding, especially in light of the tightening of the credit markets and continuing volatility of the capital markets as a result of the coronavirus. Moreover, the Company’s common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market effective January 25, 2021; while our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the change in listing may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the stock and the Company’s ability to raise capital through offerings of its equity securities.
Should the Company be unsuccessful in these efforts, it would be forced to implement headcount reductions, additional employee furloughs and/or reduced hours for certain employees, or cease operations completely.
Sources and Uses of Cash
The following table presents our abbreviated cash flows for the years ended September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020:
Operating Activities
The Company used approximately $2 million more cash from operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss of $178,000, a $949,000 forgiveness of PPP loans, the proceeds of which are included in financing activities on the Company’s statement of cash flows, a net difference in the change in inventory of $395,000, a $277,000 in the change in customer deposits and a net difference change in accounts receivable of $138,000 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 decreased by approximately $3,000, as the Company had no additions to equipment and leasehold improvements in 2021.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 and 2020 was a result of proceeds from long-term debt, described below.
Debt Instruments
On April 17, 2020, the Company was granted a loan from bankHometown in the principal amount of $474,400 pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act. The loan, which was evidenced by a Note dated April 17, 2020, was payable over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 1% to the extent not forgiven. The Company used the entire original PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the SBA forgave the loan in its entirety on January 11, 2021.
The Company also was granted a loan by the SBA in August 2020. This loan is evidenced by a promissory note dated August 10, 2020 in the principal amount of $150,000 and was made under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program of the SBA. This note is payable monthly over 30 years at an annual interest rate of 3.75% commencing two years from the date of issuance.
On February 1, 2021, the Company was granted a second PPP loan from bankHometown in the principal amount of $474,405 under the Economic Aid Act. Any amounts not forgiven will be paid back over five years at an interest rate of 1% per year. Program rules provide that loan payments will be deferred for borrowers who apply for loan forgiveness until the SBA remits the borrower's loan forgiveness amount to the lender. If a borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, payments are deferred for 10 months following the end of the covered period for the borrower’s loan forgiveness (between 8 and 24 weeks). The Company used the entire original PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the SBA forgave the loan in its entirety on August 10, 2021.
On May 6, 2021, the Company executed a Demand Promissory Note in favor of Carl H. Guild, Jr. for up to $1 million. Mr. Guild, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, agreed to provide a line of credit to the Company for working capital purposes. This note will bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and has no specified term. The outstanding principal balance at September 25, 2021 was $1,000,000, plus accrued interest of $13,195.
Backlog
Backlog at September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 amounted to $1,090,000 and $701,000, respectively. The orders in backlog at September 25, 2021 are expected to ship and/or services are expected to be performed over the next 12 months depending on customer requirements and product availability.
Performance guarantees
Certain foreign customers require the Company to guarantee bid bonds and performance of products sold. These guaranties typically take the form of standby letters of credit. Guarantees are generally required in amounts of 5% to 10% of the purchase price and last in duration from three months to one year. At September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no outstanding letters of credit.
Research and Development
Research and development efforts are undertaken by the Company primarily on its own initiative. In order to compete successfully, the Company must improve existing products and develop new products as well as attract and retain qualified personnel. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to hire and train such technical, management and sales personnel or successfully improve and develop its products.
During the fiscal years ended September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company spent $732,000 and $1,069,000, respectively, on internal product development. The Company also spent $711,000 and $563,000 on billable development efforts during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2021, the Company’s total product development costs were $189,000 lower than fiscal 2020 levels and reflected the costs of custom development, product capability enhancements and production readiness. It is expected that product development expenses in fiscal 2022 will be consistent with fiscal 2021 levels.
Capital Expenditures
Other than those stated above, there are no plans for material commitments for capital expenditures in fiscal 2022.
Material Trends and Uncertainties
As a result of the current economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a noticeable delay in the receipt of customer orders. While we remain in contact with our customers and their requirements have not changed, the operations of certain of our customers have been slowed or shut down entirely. Our suppliers thus far have been able to timely deliver components and parts necessary for the manufacture and production of the Company’s products to fulfill orders. However we cannot be sure this condition will continue and there is emerging evidence that certain parts are becoming more difficult to obtain and are adversely impacting delivery times. While the Company was able to reopen its facility in June 2020 after a brief government-mandated shutdown, we believe it is possible that new restrictions may be imposed in the near future. None the less, the Company has been able to maintain its operations, and believes it will be in a strong position to respond to our customers’ needs as any such new restrictions ease and operations return to normal, but can give no assurances. It is uncertain how long our and our customers’ operations will be impacted, and those of our suppliers, especially in light of recent increases in COVID-19 infection rates worldwide, and our ability to respond to customer requirements and supplier issues will become more challenging during a period of sustained disruption. Any period of sustained disruption would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
In order to have sufficient capital resources to fund operations, the Company has been working diligently to secure several large orders with new and existing customers. The receipt of these orders has been significantly delayed and will continue to be difficult to predict due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers as a result of their operations being reduced or shut down. Without the near term receipt of these new orders the Company will have to secure other sources of financing such as debt or equity capital.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
