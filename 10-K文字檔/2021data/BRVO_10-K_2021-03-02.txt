Coronavirus Impact (COVID-19)
Due to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus reported in many countries worldwide, local and federal governments have issued travel advisories, canceled large scale public events and closed schools. In addition, companies have begun to cancel conferences and travel plans and require employees to work from home. Global financial markets have also experienced extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets.
Adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel, potential impact on our business partners and customers, and other matters affecting the general work and business environment could harm our business and delay the implementation of our business strategy.
Management is currently aware of the global and domestic issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and the possible direct and indirect effects on the Company's operations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's current financial position, future results of operations, or liquidity, because its current operations are limited. However, investors should also be aware of factors, which includes the possibility of Covid-19 effects on operational status, could have a negative impact on the Company's prospects and the consistency of progress in the areas of revenue generation, liquidity, and generation of capital resources. These may include: (i) variations in revenue, (ii) possible inability to attract investors for its equity securities or otherwise raise adequate funds from any source should the company seek to do so, (iii) increased governmental regulation or significant changes in that regulation, (iv) increased competition, (v) unfavorable outcomes to litigation involving the Company or to which the Company may become a party in the future, and (vi) a very competitive and rapidly changing operating environment. The adverse events may also adversely impact our ability to raise capital or to continue as a going concern. We continue to monitor the recent outbreak of the coronavirus on our operations. The global economic slowdown and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business and results of operations. It may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties which the Company faces.
Going Concern
As of December 31, 2020, Bravo Multinational had an accumulated deficit of $89,992,536. Our independent certified public accountants have stated in their report on our audited financial statements for the calendar year-end that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While we are attempting to generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our securities. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues will improve the Company's operating results. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, we may not be successful. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues. This issue is addressed in footnote 4 to the financial statements.

General and Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $16,045 compared to $23,599 for year ending December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower printing costs due to the fact that the Company became a fully reporting Company with the SEC during that period.
Professional Fees for the year ending December 31, 2020 totaled $70,930 compared to $124,452 for year ending December 31, 2019, the decrease was attributed to lower legal and accounting fees incurred as a fully reporting Company with the SEC.
Board of Director fees for the year ending December 31, 2020 totaled $48,435,417 compared to $-0- for year ending December 31, 2019, the increase was attributed to the imputed value of $48,000,000 from the issuance of 2,000,000 Series 'A' Preferred shares and accrued compensation of $435,417 for pay of two of the Company's Board of Directors per terms of their employment contracts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:
As of December 31, 2020, our assets, consisting primarily of cash, totaled $6,273. The Company's total liabilities at December 31, 2020 were $825,653, which consisted primarily of accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, amounts due to related parties, notes payable, and accrued board of director fees. As of this date the Company had an accumulated deficit of $89,992,536 and working capital of deficit of $819,380. This significant increase in our deficit over the same period in 2019, is not due to operational issues, but is instead attributable to the accounting treatment of equity compensation issued during the period.
As of December 31, 2019, our assets totaled $16,286, which consisted of cash and prepaid expenses. The Company's total liabilities were $2,103,747, which consisted of accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, amounts due to related parties, notes payable, accrued board of director fees, and stock payables to related parties. As of this date the Company had an accumulated deficit of $29,518,707 and a working capital of deficit of $2,087,461.
The Company's significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern (see footnote 4 to the financial statements). The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation of our business plan, and we will need additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses at this time. Unless the Company is able to raise working capital, it is likely that the Company will either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan. For the next 12 months the Company has an oral commitment from its CEO to advance funds as necessary to meet our operating requirement.

Cash from Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $76,498 for year ended December 31, 2020, and was $166,575 for year ended December 31, 2019.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its financial statements, including revenue recognition. The Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued at this time that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Accounting Principals
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.
Stock-Based Compensation
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)to expand the scope of ASC 718,Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)("ASU 2018-07"), to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is still evaluating this ASU and anticipates it will not have significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: (1) Identify the contract with a client; (2)Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation.
We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
