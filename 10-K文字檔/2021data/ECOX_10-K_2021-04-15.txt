Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This discussion and analysis may include statements regarding our expectations with respect to our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources. Such statements, along with any other non-historical statements in the discussion, are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, factors listed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC''). We do not assume an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements contained herein.
Overview and Financial Condition
We are an innovative entrant into the green technology licensing space, and as a recently registered publicly traded company with our initial S-1 registration statement declared effective as of January 15, 2021, we are one of the few publicly-traded green technology development firms in the U.S. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have nearly one year of implementing our business plan under new management and control, following our change of control in late February 2020. Due to the unexpected economic disruption that then ensued due to the global health pandemic, we didn’t generate significant cash revenues over the year, with net sales of $0 and a gross profit of $0 in the fiscal year 2020.
Our total operating and other expenses in excess of our gross profit have resulted in a net loss of $3,896,738, which, considered in light of our past financial performance, give rise to the going concern statement below. In furthering our business, as described in Item 1 above concerning our business and operations, we are seeking to license commercially viable green technologies that fulfill concrete market demands, and develop product applications that we can sell into the market. Our technology licensing and product development activities are spearheaded by Julia Otey-Roades, our Chief Executive Officer.
We cannot assure you we will be successful in raising sufficient capital to implement our full business plan or assuming we can, that we will be able to develop a successful business. For further information please see Part 1, Item 1 “Business.”
Going Concern
Because of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, our independent auditors have indicated in their report on our December 31, 2020 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The continuation of our business is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, in which we have not been successful, and/or obtaining additional financing from our stockholders or other sources, as may be required. The issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
We continue to incur ongoing administrative and other expenses, including public company expenses, primarily accounting and legal fees, in excess of corresponding revenue. While we continue to implement our business strategy, we intend to finance our activities through:
· managing current cash and cash equivalents on hand from the Company’s past debt and equity offerings by controlling costs, and
· seeking additional financing through sales of additional securities to investors. The Company sustained continued operating losses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
While priority is on generating cash from operations through the sale of the Company's products and services, Management is also seeking to raise additional working capital through various financing sources, including the sale of the Company's equity and/or debt securities, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our business as desired and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on us and/or our stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of our shares of common stock.
Results of Operations
Year Ending December 31, 2020 Compared December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Our sales totaled $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company is continuing in its efforts to increase its sales but there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so.
We had $0 and $0 costs of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2020 and $2019, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll, professional fees, sales and marketing, research and development and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $186,934 and $201,968 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $757,075 in development and manufacturing expenses compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the category was due to implementation of programs to development new products. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $260,000 in executive compensation and $2,635,750 in consulting fees compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company also recognized interest expense of $46,454, including amortization of debt discount of $43,783, a derivative loss of $10,525 during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized interest expense of $6,498, including amortization of debt discount of $6,399, a derivative loss of $20,658 and a loss on sale of investments of $259,186.
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of $3,896,738 and $488,310 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash of $84 ($246 as of December 31, 2019). Furthermore, the Company had a working capital deficit of $567,487 and $88,450 as of December 31, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company used $56,086 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss of $3,896,738, partially offset by; amortization of debt discount of $43,783; stock-based compensation expense of $3,382,750, derivative loss of $10,525 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $222,069 as well as an increase in deferred revenue of $181,525.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company used $200,655 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss of $488,310, partially offset by a loss on sale of investment of $259,186, amortization of debt discount of $6,399; and derivative loss of $20,658.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not have cash from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company received $138,748 in proceeds from the sale of investment.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had net cash provided by financing activities of $55,924, primarily from proceeds on convertible debentures and convertible notes with related party of $35,924 and proceeds from sale of common stock of $20,000 compared to proceeds of $40,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 from the sale of convertible debentures.
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. Our only sources for cash at this time are investments by others in this offering, selling our products and loans from our director. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business.
Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company’s success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, with the January 15, 2021 effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1, as of January 15, 2021, the Company is obligated to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. As our business model and strategy were reinvigorated with our February 2020 change in control and new management, we are in a start-up stage of operations, and in general have generated limited revenues since our inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our success and performance are subject to all the normal risks inherent in the development of a new line of business, including our limited capital resources and the strength of our business partners’ business and financial positions, and the market for our green technologies.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
