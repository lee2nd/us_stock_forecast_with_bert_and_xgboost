OVERVIEW
As of December 31, 2020, we operated in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. The Company’s plan is to expand to more locations in North America in the next year. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community. Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition. This will result in larger contracting jobs, statewide expansion and growth in revenue. We remain committed to high quality operations.
Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses. Footnotes to the financial statements discloses the related party transactions of Officer, Directors and other related parties.
FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019
Sales decreased to $1,161,106 in 2020, a decrease of $1,191,061 or 51% under 2019 sales of $2,352,167. The Covid 19 Pandemic, Lack of funds and available staff has reduced our ability to maintain our sales momentum. Our experience has shown us that there is going to be such pressure on our market, and we are changing to prevent the decreases in sales in the future. We have added new products and new sales personnel and intend to find merger and acquisition funding and acquisition or merger candidates during the current year. There is no assurance that ABCO will be able to accomplish these goals in the coming year.
Cost of sales decreased by $916,623, or 54% to $784,730 in 2020 from $1,701,353 in 2019 due primarily to the decrease in sales. The Company also changed its focus from residential installs to a commercial focus in order to meet changes in the market. Gross margin as a percentage of total sales was at 32% in 2020 from 28% in 2019, primarily due to higher margins associated with commercial jobs and better management of costs on the larger commercial jobs in 2019. We hope to bid these contracts more favorably in the future to prevent negative cost of sales numbers. We hope that more efficient production and a sales mix shift to the higher profit commercial market emphasis will improve these numbers.
General and administrative expenses decreased by $266,758 to $846,640 in 2020 from $1,113,398 in 2019 due primarily to increases in professional fees and derivative expenses for the period and the 2020 reduction of administration staff. In order to control operating expenses and to closely administering public company expenses in 2020, we reduced our staff. The 51% decrease in sales revenue is the main reason administrative expenses needed to decrease in 2020.
Net loss from operations increased by $7,680 to $(470,264) for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a loss from operations of $(462,584) for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to expenses from financing. We had similar margins in 2020 as in 2019 due to the emphasis on commercial projects.
Total Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $(524,759) and $(1,381,077) for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is attributable to expenses from financing and professional fee charges in 2019 that did not occur in 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for carrying cost of accounts receivable and inventory during and after completion of contracts. This process can easily exceed 90 days and requires the contractor to pay all or most of the cost of the project without assistance from suppliers. Our working capital at December 31, 2020 was $(1,509,716) and it was $(1,558,101) at December 31, 2019. This decrease of $46,385 was primarily funded by our private equity offerings. Bank financing has not been available to the Company.
ABCO Energy has increased its loan obligations or long term debt in 2020. Our long-term debt net of current portion totaled $472,293 at December 31, 2020 and $300,000 at December 31, 2019 due mainly to the SBA loans and equipment purchase loans obtained by the Company. The Company owed Officers and Directors $311,340 and $248,558 respectively on demand notes, an increase of $62,782 as an additional loan from the President of ABCO.
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 our net cash used in operating activities was $(66,859) and $(664,840) respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in the period ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted primarily of net loss from operations adjusted for non-cash expenses and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and mainly the changes in the results of operations.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $(47,094) and $(24,737) respectively. This is primarily due to the purchase of autos for operations. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $155,601 and $634,490 respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2020 and 2019, resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock and the conversion of convertible debt into common stock.
Since our inception on August 8, 2008 through December 31, 2020 we have incurred net losses of $(7,086,267), including the effects of derivatives on convertible debt totaling $2,288,555. Our cash and cash equivalent balances were $54,268 and $12,620 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had total liabilities of $2,398,499 as opposed to $2,234,383 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $164,116. Most of the increase occurred because of the SBA long term loan and the auto purchases.
We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily the working capital required for the marketing of our products and services by additional financing and more operations income. This will likely be in the form of future debt or equity financing. Based on our current operating plan, we have sufficient working capital to sustain operations for the short term if we do not expand our business. We will not however, be able to reach our goals and projections for multistate expansion without a cash infusion. We expect that our revenue will increase at a steady pace and that this volume of business will result in profitable operations in the future.
OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS
The Company has no off balance sheet transactions during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
