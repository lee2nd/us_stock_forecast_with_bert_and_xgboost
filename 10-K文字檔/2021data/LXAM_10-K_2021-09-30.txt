The Company changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to April 30. The transition report was for the four-month period of January 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. The information for the year ended April 30, 2020 is presented for comparative purposes only and is unaudited.
Comparative Consolidated Statement of Operations
(Unaudited)
OVERVIEW
Results of operations for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:
Revenues
For the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s revenues were $998,947 and $966,023, respectively.
The increase in revenue is due to an increase in sales to existing customers and an increase in the selling price of products.
Cost of Goods Sold
For the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, cost of goods sold was $683,951 and $1,162,673. These primarily consisted of cost of goods sold expense of $507,099 and $658,075, raw materials of $3,885 and $130,029, truck operating expenses of $2,773 and $62,289, direct labor and payroll of $37,668 and $92,106, packaging materials of $2,358 and $1,841, blending costs of $130,168 and $6,526, freight costs of $0 and $146,839, disposal of waste of $0 and $55,716, warehouse supplies of $0 and $7,998, and equipment repairs of $0 and $1,254.
The decrease in cost of goods sold is a result of a combination of a change in the raw material ingredients of a major product and price increases on each of the Company’s products.
Operating Expenses
For the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, operating expenses were $2,340,997 and $2,403,504. These primarily consisted of general and administrative costs of $1,506,792 and $1,829,709, product delivery costs of $594,098 and $252,230, selling expenses of $84,936 and $121,492, and depreciation/amortization expenses of $155,171 and $200,073.
For the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, the general and administrative expenses of $1,506,792 and $1,829,709 can be broken down into five major categories: 1) fees related to being a reporting entity, 2) start-up costs, 3) business development, 4) wages, and 5) other/miscellaneous expenses. The majority of the costs are fees related to being a reporting entity, which total $1,127,154 and $1,755,822. These fees are comprised of audit fees of $89,743 and $72,582, accounting fees of $38,523 and $44,987, legal fees of $42,410 and $47,147, consulting fees of $468,933 and $383,521, and officers’ compensation of $309,333 (unpaid) and $480,211 (paid). General and administrative expenses also included non-cash expenses, specifically $178,212 and $727,374 of stock compensation expense. Business development expenses were $48,535 and $44,044, wages were $22,149 and $23,755, and other/miscellaneous expenses were $308,954 and $6,088.
The decrease in operating expenses is due to a reduction of the number of employees, plus changes in the utilization of the Company’s former lease of property at 145 Rose Lane in Frisco, Texas, which allowed for a reduction in utilities, production supplies and maintenance costs.
General and Administrative Expenses
Year Ended April 30, 2021
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended April 30, 2021, the primary sources of liquidity were cash flows from financing activities, and in particular, proceeds from issuance of convertible notes payable and the receipt of PPP loans.
The Company had total assets of $3,353,460 as of April 30, 2021. Its current assets on April 30, 2021, consisted of $112,982 in accounts receivable, $137,211 in inventory and $7,960 in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and its long-term assets were $3,095,307.
As of April 30, 2021, the Company had total liabilities of $2,468,547, including $554,588 in accounts payable, $1,201,568 of accrued expenses and $127,624 in notes payable, $479,975 in related party payables and lease liabilities, and $104,752 in PPP loans.
On April 30, 2021, the Company had stockholders’ equity of $884,913.
The Company has incurred net losses since inception. Its cash position is insufficient to meet its anticipated continuing operating expenses, and its independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that it can continue as an ongoing business unless it alters its business model and/or obtains additional capital, so it can pay its ongoing operational costs. The Company has significantly altered its business model to the point where it believes these changes alone will make the Company self-sustaining, although there is no assurance that this will happen. In addition, the Company continues to seek investment capital in the belief that this will allow more rapid growth and make its ability to continue operations less doubtful.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the Company will need additional financing to fund additional material capital expenditures and to fully implement its business plan. There are no assurances that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. If additional financing is not available, the Company will need to reduce, defer, or cancel development programs, planned initiatives and overhead expenditures as a way to supplement the cash flows generated by operations. The failure to adequately fund its capital requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, the sale of additional equity securities plus derivative securities to raise financing will result in additional dilution to the Company’s stockholders, and incurring additional indebtedness could involve the imposition of covenants that restrict its operations. Management, in the normal course of business, is trying to raise additional capital through sales of common stock as well as seeking financing from third parties, via both debt and equity, to balance the Company’s cash requirements and to finance specific business initiatives.

Critical Accounting Policies
Certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. These policies are contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
FASB ASC 825-10 requires disclosure of fair value information about certain financial instruments, including, but not limited to, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management on April 30, 2020, and 2021, and December 31, 2019. The carrying value of the financial instruments included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements approximated their fair values.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at, or approximate, fair value as of the reporting date because of their short-term nature.
The carrying value of the notes payable approximates fair value as they bear market rates of interest.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product sold is recognized when obligations with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer or delivery of the product, signifying the point in time when the customer obtains control of the promised goods. Our performance obligation is delivering the product to the customer; and therefore, the transaction price, which is stated on the invoice, is allocated 100% to the sole performance obligation of product delivery.
Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return, and payment is due net of 15 days. We do not record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time of the sale. We also do not record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts.
Sales Taxes
Sales (and similar) taxes that are imposed on the Company's sales and collected from customers are excluded from revenues.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and Handling Costs for shipping and handling activities, including those activities that occur subsequent to transfer of control to the customer, are recorded as cost of sales and are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues costs for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the promised good has transferred to the customer.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Account’s receivables are recorded at invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established, as necessary, based on past experience and other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating bad debts. Such factors include growth and composition of accounts receivable, the relationship of the allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable, and current economic conditions. The determination of the collectability of amounts due requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on assessing the Company’s portfolio on an individual customer and on an overall basis. This process consists of a review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer account, and the financial condition of the Company’s customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company establishes or adjusts the allowance for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio as a whole. On April 30, 2021 and 2020, and December 31, 2019, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes the fair value of the stock-based compensation awards as wages in the accompanying statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on a risk-free interest rate from 1.60-2.56% in 2019, dividend yield of 0%, expected life of 3.25 - 5 years and volatility of 71.70%. For the year ended April 30, 2021 and the transition period ended April 30, 2020, no stock-based awards have been issued.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between the enterprise value/cash paid less the fair value of all recognized net asset fair values including identifiable intangible asset values in a business combination. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on the reporting unit. As a result of the certain business developments and changes in the Company's long-term projections, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company concluded a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment to be performed. The qualitative assessment thresholds were not met. The Company calculated the quantitative impairment test of using the implied fair market value using market data and concluded there was no goodwill impairment loss. Based on annual testing, the Company has determined that there was no goodwill impairment in Fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.
The Company first evaluates qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If after qualitatively assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then further testing is unnecessary. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company then estimates the fair value of the reporting unit and compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, as discussed below.
The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step, the reporting unit's fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
Off Balance Sheet Transactions and Related Matters
There are no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources of the Company.
Disclosure of Contractual Obligations
Effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an Exclusive Patent Licenses Agreement with CBI, pursuant to which the Company would sell DeconGel™ and pay 10% of the net selling price to CBI, as a license fee.
As discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to certain debt instruments related to its vehicles and equipment.
