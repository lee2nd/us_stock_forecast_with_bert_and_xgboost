INTRODUCTION
Management's Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying financial statements and related notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and the results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows:
Basis of Presentation
Our Company has a history of recurring losses, which has resulted in an accumulated deficit of $17,141,175 as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, prior to acquisition of Lifted on February 24, 2020, our Company had no sources of revenue. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
This MD&A section discusses our Company’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition and certain factors that may affect our future results. You should read this MD&A in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report.
Overview

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our Company’s current assets, current liabilities and working capital as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as well as our Company’s cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $439,080; in comparison, at December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,384,929. When the Company acquired 100% of the ownership of Lifted, a component of the Merger consideration was $3,750,000 cash paid to Nicholas S. Warrender; this payment to Nicholas S. Warrender was the primary driver of the change in cash and cash equivalents between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, we also had a dividend receivable from Bendistillery, Inc. in the amount of $2,495; there was no dividend receivable from Bendistillery, Inc. recorded at December 31, 2019.

Prior to acquiring 100% of Lifted on February 24, 2020, we did not own 100% of any other operating company, or recognize the revenue or accounts receivable of any operating subsidiary, so we did not have any accounts receivable at December 31, 2019.

Total current assets at December 31, 2020 of $3,264,777 were adequate for us to fund current operations. In comparison, at December 31, 2019, we had total current assets of $4,594,512.

That is, Lifted recorded a $4,429 reduction in its investment in SmplyLifted LLC at December 31, 2020.

We plan to sustain the Company as a going concern by taking the following actions: (1) acquiring and/or developing profitable businesses that will create positive income from operations; and/or (2) completing private placements of our common stock and/or preferred stock. We believe that by taking these actions, we will be provided with sufficient future operations and cash flow to continue as a going concern. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating such actions on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, any such actions can be expected to result in substantial dilution to the existing shareholders of the Company. Please note that on February 24, 2020, we acquired 100% of the ownership interests in Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly d/b/a Lifted Liquids).
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements accompanying this annual report.
The Company’s Investments in Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits
On April 30, 2019, the Company purchased 4.99% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,896,200. The Company’s investments in Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits made the Company a minority owner of these companies. As a minority owner, the Company will not be able to recognize any portion of Ablis’, Bendistillery’s or Bend Spirits’ revenues or earnings in the Company’s financial statements.
Pursuant to US GAAP, the Company is obligated to periodically review its investments. The Company has limited ability to comment on these companies’ operations and financial performance. The Company’s ability to review the financial performance of its investment in these companies is limited: the financial statements of these companies are not audited; the Company is not active in the management of these companies; and these companies have only held one meeting of their boards of directors since the closing of our investment. Consequently, the Company’s assessment of these companies is inherently limited to infrequent and relatively brief conversations with officers of these companies, and to reviews of unaudited financial statements that are delivered to us on an irregular basis.
On February 17, 2021, a telephonic meeting of the board of directors of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits was held. During this meeting, the management of those companies reviewed the performance of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits during calendar year 2020. Based upon the financial and non-financial information that was shared with Acquired Sales Corp. during that conference call, the management of Acquired Sales Corp. believes that no impairment of the value of Bendistillery, Bend Spirits or Ablis is warranted at this point in time. The information that was shared by the management of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits included,
among other things: a 17% increase in sales in 2020 compared to 2019 at Bendistillery, expansion of Bendistillery’s business from restaurants and bars to liquor stores, positive employee morale since none of Bendistillery’s sales team was laid off during the pandemic, new clients of Bend Spirits expected to come online in 2021, and positive sales trends during recent months at Ablis including more direct-to-consumer sales. Moreover, in Oregon, bars and restaurants opened up to 25% capacity on February 12, 2021; historically, most of Ablis’ sales have come from bars and restaurants. Also, a new 17,000 square foot building is being built at Bendistillery’s headquarters, and pasteurization, canning and packaging are expected to be brought in house once the building is operational later in 2021; by bringing pasteurization, canning and packaging in house, management expects to save manufacturing time and costs and to internalize the profits from those functions. Also, Ablis’ management finished re-branding the brand this year, has cut operational costs, is in the process of launching new functional beverages, and is in discussions with some multi-state distributors to distribute Ablis beverages.
CBD Lion LLC
On August 8, 2019, the Company made an unsecured $300,000 loan (the “Loan”) to CBD Lion LLC (“Lion”) evidenced by a promissory note (the “Note”) in connection with the proposed Merger Agreement with Lion. Per the terms of the Note, if the Transaction did not close and the merger agreement were terminated, then the Loan was to be repaid by Lion to the Company in six equal monthly installments of principal, together with accrued interest at the rate of 6% per year, with the first such installment due and payable by Lion to the Company on the first day of the first calendar month following the termination of the merger agreement. The Merger Agreement was terminated by the Company on November 14, 2019 and the Note became payable. During December 2019, the principal of the Note was repaid by Lion down to $200,000, and Lion also paid the accrued interest on the Note of $6,945.
Due to termination of the Merger Agreement, and per Section 5.15(b) of the Merger Agreement, as of December 31, 2019 the Company owed CBD Lion $31,500 for reimbursement of professional fees related to the audit of CBD Lion.
This left Lion with a net balance owed to the Company of $168,500 as of December 31, 2019. In March 2020, Lion and the Company agreed that the repayment of such $168,500 will be made in eleven equal monthly installments of principal due and payable by Lion to the Company on the first day of each calendar month starting on April 1, 2020, and that no additional interest will accrue. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Lion has made all eleven payments of $15,318 leaving a Loan balance of $0 remaining. Imputed interest on the Loan during 2020 was $2,112.
The William Noyes Webster Foundation, Inc.
The William Noyes Webster Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”), a non-profit Massachusetts corporation, has received a provisional registration from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to own and operate a medical marijuana cultivation facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and a medical marijuana dispensary in Dennis, Massachusetts. Heatley is the founder and a member of the board of directors of the Foundation.
Teaming Agreement - We believe it is highly likely that the board of directors of the Foundation will only approve contracts that have been negotiated and approved by Heatley. Consequently, on July 8, 2014, we entered into a Teaming Agreement (the "Teaming Agreement") with Heatley, in which, among other things: (1) we and Heatley agreed to use our respective best efforts, working exclusively together as a team, and not as a partnership or other entity, in order to consummate transactions, agreements, contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we will provide capital and expertise to the Foundation; and (2) Heatley agreed that Heatley shall not, and shall not permit the Foundation to, discuss or negotiate for debt or equity financing, or consulting services or other expertise, from any third party. We claim that Heatley violated the Teaming Agreement by discussing and negotiating for debt or equity financing, or consulting services or other expertise, from at least one third party. Heatley claims that we violated the Teaming Agreement alleging that we failed to lend funds to the Foundation in accordance with the Teaming Agreement. We believe Heatley's claim to be baseless. No assurances whatsoever can be made that Heatley will comply with the terms of the Teaming Agreement, nor that we will be able to adequately enforce the terms of the Teaming Agreement if it is ever the subject of litigation.
Promissory Note - On July 14, 2014, the Foundation signed and delivered to us a Secured Promissory Note (the "Note") which is in the stated loan amount of $1,500,000, and is secured by a Security Agreement of even date therewith (the “Security Agreement”). The Note provides that the $1,500,000 loan may be advanced in one or more installments as the Foundation and we may mutually agree upon. The Foundation and we mutually agreed that the first installment of this loan would be $602,500. Pursuant to instructions from the Foundation, on July 14, 2014, we paid $2,500 owed by the Foundation to one of its consultants, and we advanced $600,000 directly to the Foundation. The amount and timing of subsequent loan installments under the Note, which could have totaled $897,500, had not yet been mutually agreed upon between the Foundation and us as of the date of the Note.
Between April and July 2015, we loaned an additional $135,350 to the Foundation, evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security Agreement. Following such additional loans, the principal of the loan from us to the Foundation, evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security Agreement, is now $737,850.
The principal balance outstanding under the Note bore interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum, compounded monthly. It was contemplated that the first payment of accrued interest by the Foundation under the Note would be made as soon after the Foundation
commences operations of the Plymouth Cultivation Facility and the Dennis Dispensary as the Foundation's cash flows shall reasonably permit, but in any event no later than one year after the Foundation commences operations. The principal of the Note would be payable in eight consecutive equal quarterly installments, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Foundation commences operations. Principal on the Note and related accrued interest would be considered past due if the aforementioned payments were not received by their due dates.
Uncollectable Note and Interest Receivable - We assessed the collectability of the Note based on the adequacy of the Foundation’s collateral and the Foundation’s capability of repaying the Note according to its terms. Based on this assessment, on September 1, 2015, we concluded that Note and interest receivable would not be collectible. As such, we wrote off the Note totaling $737,850 and interest receivable totaling $97,427 as bad debt expense on September 1, 2015.
Acquisition of Real Estate in Rhode Island
As discussed in our prior public filings, we have attempted to acquire one or more of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties. The Mesolella/Jacobs Properties are parcels of real estate in Rhode Island that are owned by entities affiliated with Vincent J. Mesolella and his son Derek V. Mesolella, formerly an independent contractor to AQSP. One of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties was also partly owned by an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs.
Discussions among Messrs. Mesolella and Jacobs and our independent directors have made it highly likely that we will never purchase any of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties.
Simultaneous with Vincent J. Mesolella’s agreement to negotiate in good faith regarding the possibility of us acquiring the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties, in November 2014, the officers and directors of the Company were awarded the right to purchase, directly or using a designee, for an aggregate price of $2 per director: (a) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.35 million shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.01 per share; and (b) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.35 million shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1.85 per share, 100,000 of which warrants are vested, and 1.25 million of which warrants are subject to the condition that the Company shall have acquired at least one of the Mesolella/Jacobs Properties.
Other Matters
From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims involving Acquired Sales that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
However, please refer to “The Lifted Made Business, Description of Legal Proceedings” above, for information about the one pending lawsuit that involves Lifted, in which Lifted is the defendant. Depending upon the outcome of this one pending lawsuit against Lifted, there could be a material adverse effect on Acquired Sales Corp’s business, financial condition and operating results.
