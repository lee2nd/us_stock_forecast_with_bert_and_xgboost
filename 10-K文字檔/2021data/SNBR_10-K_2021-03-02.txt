ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
The discussion in this Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements that relate to future plans, events, financial results or performance. You can identify forward-looking statements by those that are not historical in nature, particularly those that use terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “intend,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these or similar terms. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, among others:
•Current and future general and industry economic trends and consumer confidence;
•Risks inherent in outbreaks of pandemics or contagious disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic and related consequences such as supply shortages, labor disruptions, and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to close certain businesses or limit occupancy or operating hours;
•The effectiveness of our marketing messages;
•The efficiency of our advertising and promotional efforts;
•Our ability to execute our Total Retail distribution strategy;
•Our ability to achieve and maintain acceptable levels of product and service quality, and acceptable product return and warranty claims rates;
•Our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line, and consumer acceptance of our products, product quality, innovation and brand image;
•Industry competition, the emergence of additional competitive products and the adequacy of our intellectual property rights to protect our products and brand from competitive or infringing activities;
•Claims that our products, processes, advertising, or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others or do not comply with laws or regulations;
•Availability of attractive and cost-effective consumer credit options;
•Our lean manufacturing processes with minimal levels of inventory, which may leave us vulnerable to shortages in supply;
•Our dependence on significant suppliers and third parties and our ability to maintain relationships with key suppliers or third-parties, including several sole-source suppliers or providers of services;
•Rising commodity costs and other inflationary pressures;
•Risks inherent in global sourcing activities, including tariffs, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, strikes and the potential for shortages in supply;
•Risks of disruption in the operation of any of our main manufacturing facilities or assembly and distribution facilities;
•Increasing government regulation;
•Pending or unforeseen litigation and the potential for adverse publicity associated with litigation;
•The adequacy of our and third-party information systems to meet the evolving needs of our business and existing and evolving risks and regulatory standards applicable to data privacy and cybersecurity;
•The costs and potential disruptions to our business related to enhancing, patching, upgrading our information systems;
•The vulnerability of our and third-party information systems to attacks by hackers or other cyber threats that could compromise the security or accessibility of our systems, result in a data breach or disrupt our business; and
•Our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, executive and other key team members, including qualified retail sales professionals and managers.
Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained under the caption “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COVID-19 Pandemic - Impact on our Business
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March 2020, government restrictions resulted in the temporary closure of most of our retail stores. While prioritizing the safety of our team, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity, we swiftly took decisive actions to strengthen our liquidity, cash flows and financial position, and mitigate the future impact on our operations and financial performance.
Despite a 20% decline in net sales during the three months ended June 27, 2020 when 47% of our stores were closed on average, 2020 net sales increased 9% and net income increased by 70% compared with the same period one year ago. Approximately 99% of our stores were open on average during the six months ended January 2, 2021.
While we generated strong financial performance during 2020, the volatility, length and severity of the pandemic's impact on consumer demand and the resulting impact on our future financial performance remains uncertain. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.
Health and Safety of our Team Members and Customers. Upon onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented precautionary and sanitary guidelines throughout our operations, including stores, manufacturing, home delivery and headquarters based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) recommendations, and other best practices.
Expense Management. With the reduction in second-quarter 2020 revenue due to the pandemic, we implemented appropriate expense management actions, including:
•In April 2020, we furloughed nearly 40% of our team members with another 30% working reduced hours. The majority of our team members returned to work as stores reopened and customer demand increased. In response to changes in the business, we restructured some teams, which resulted in approximately 10% of positions nationwide being eliminated as we reallocated headcount to support the changing needs of our business;
•We temporarily reduced our sales and marketing expenses. For all of 2020, we increased media spending 4% year-over-year, supporting the 9% increase in net sales; and
•We negotiated rent deferrals and abatements for stores closed due to COVID-19.
Liquidity, Cash Flows and Financial Position. We took the following actions to preserve cash, increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position:
•Added $75 million of additional liquidity on April 3, 2020 through an incremental 364-day term loan under our credit facility’s $150 million accordion. On September 24, 2020, we repaid the $75 million term loan with cash provided by operating activities;
•In March 2020, temporarily suspended share repurchases under our Board-approved share repurchase program. In October 2020, resumed share repurchases and repurchased $190 million of our common stock ($71.44 per share, based on trade dates) during the three months ended January 2, 2021;
•Temporarily reduced capital expenditures to $37 million for 2020, compared with $59 million during 2019. We remained committed to our long-term innovation initiatives, including investing $41 million in research and development expenses during 2020, 17% more than the prior year;
•Net liquidity available under our credit facility was $202 million at January 2, 2021; and
•Our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement was 2.2x as of January 2, 2021. The maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement is 4.5x.
CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the President signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) into law. The CARES Act includes the following relief, among others:
•Amended federal tax laws to permit 100% bonus depreciation for eligible qualified improvement property placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2023;
•Employers were eligible for a 50 percent refundable payroll tax credit on wages paid up to $10,000, per employee, during 2020. The credit was available to employers whose businesses were disrupted due to virus shutdowns and those that had a decrease in gross receipts of 50 percent or more when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The credit could be claimed for employees who are retained but not currently working due to the crisis for firms with more than 100 employees; and
•Provided for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. This has provided us with additional liquidity during 2020.
Results of Operations
Fiscal 2020 Summary
Financial highlights for fiscal 2020 were as follows:
•Net sales for 2020 increased 9% to $1.9 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in 2019. Total Retail comparable sales increased 6% and sales from net opened/closed stores in the past 12 months added 1.5 percentage points (ppt.) of growth in 2020. In addition, 2020 included 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in the prior year, with the extra week benefiting 2020 net sales by $41 million. For additional details, see the components of total net sales growth on page 31.
•Sales per store in 2020 (Total Retail sales for stores open at least one year, including Online, Phone and Chat sales, adjusted for the additional 53rd week) on a trailing twelve-month basis totaled $3.1 million, 6% higher than 2019.
•2020 operating income of $185 million increased by $73 million, or 65%, compared with $112 million in the prior year. Our 2020 operating income rate increased to 10.0% of net sales, compared with 6.6% of net sales in 2019. Our 2020 operating income and operating income rate were positively impacted by the 9% increase in net sales, a 0.4 ppt. increase in our gross profit rate and 3.0 ppt. reduction in our operating expense rate.
•We continued to prioritize investments in near- and long-term growth drivers in 2020, including a 17% increase in our innovation driving R&D expenses.
•Net income in 2020 increased 70% to $139 million, compared with net income of $82 million in 2019. Net income per diluted share increased 81% to $4.90, compared with $2.70 per diluted share in 2019. Diluted earnings per share for 2020 benefited from the profits generated during the additional 53rd week ($0.30 per diluted share).
•We achieved a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 25.0% in 2020, compared with 17.8% in 2019.
•Cash provided by operating activities in 2020 increased by 48% to $280 million, compared with $189 million for the prior year. Purchases of property and equipment for 2020 decreased to $37 million, compared with $59 million in 2019. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to actions taken to temporarily reduce capital spending based on the economic uncertainties associated with the pandemic.
•We ended 2020 with $244 million of borrowings under our credit facility, compared with $231 million at the end of 2019. Net liquidity available under our credit facility was $202 million at January 2, 2021. Our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement was 2.2x as of January 2, 2021. The maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement is 4.5x.
•In 2020, we invested $228 million to repurchase 3.4 million shares of our common stock ($66.49 per share, based on trade dates) under our Board-approved share repurchase program. As of January 2, 2021, the remaining authorization under our Board-approved share repurchase program was $247 million.
The following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as dollars and percentages of net sales. Figures are in millions, except percentages and per share amounts. Amounts may not add due to rounding differences.
The percentage of our total net sales, by dollar volume, was as follows:
The components of total net sales growth, including comparable net sales changes, were as follows:
____________________
(1)Stores are included in the comparable-store calculation in the 13th full month of operations. Stores that have been remodeled or repositioned within the same shopping center remain in the comparable-store base. Fiscal 2020 included 53 weeks, as compared to 52 weeks for the other periods presented. Total Retail comparable sales have been adjusted to remove the estimated impact of the additional week.
Other sales metrics were as follows:
____________________
(1)Trailing-twelve months Total Retail comparable sales per store open at least one year.
(2)Trailing-twelve months for stores open at least one year (excludes Online, Phone and Chat sales).
(3)Represents Total Retail net sales divided by Total Retail mattress units.
(4)Fiscal 2020 included 53 weeks, as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2019. The additional week in 2020 was in the fiscal fourth quarter. Total Retail comparable sales have been adjusted to remove the estimated impact of the additional week on the twelve months ended January 2, 2021.
The number of retail stores operating during the last three years was as follows:
Comparison of 2020 and 2019
Net sales
Net sales in 2020 increased 9% to $1.9 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in 2019. The sales increase was driven by a 6% comparable sales increase in Total Retail and 1.5 percentage points (ppt.) of growth from net opened/closed stores in the past 12 months. In addition, 2020 included 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in the prior year, with the extra week benefiting 2020 net sales by $41 million. Online, Phone and Chat sales (included in comparable sales noted above) made up 15% of total net sales compared with 8% in the prior year as consumers embrace transacting remotely with Sleep Number as well as in our stores. For additional details, see the components of total net sales growth on page 31.
The $158 million net sales increase compared with the same period one year ago was primarily comprised of: (i) a $90 million increase from Total Retail comparable sales; (ii) $41 million from the additional 53rd week; and (iii) a $33 million increase resulting from net opened/closed stores; partially offset by (iii) a $6 million decrease in Wholesale/Other sales. Total Retail mattress units increased 10% compared to the prior-year period. Average revenue per mattress unit in Total Retail of $4,856 remained consistent year over year.
Gross profit
Gross profit for 2020 of $1.2 billion increased by $104 million, or 9.9%, compared with $1.1 billion in 2019. The 2020 gross profit rate increased to 62.3% of net sales, compared with 61.9% for the prior-year period. The 0.4 ppt. increase in the gross profit rate was mainly due to: (i) leverage from the 9% net sales increase and efficiency initiatives (0.6 ppt.); partially offset by (ii) higher performance-based incentive compensation expense (0.2 ppt.). In addition, our gross profit rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to a variety of other factors, including return and exchange costs.
Sales and marketing expenses
Sales and marketing expenses totaled $771 million in 2020, compared with $767 million last year. The sales and marketing expense rate decreased to 41.5% of net sales, compared with 45.2% for the same period one year ago. The current-year sales and marketing expenses rate decrease of 3.7 ppt. was primarily due to: (i) actions taken to manage expenses in response to the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and (ii) the leveraging impact of the 9% net sales increase. Expense management actions included leveraging our media spending, which increased by 4% compared with the prior year, while net sales increased by 9%, and lower payroll costs due to reduced store operating hours and improved productivity.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $21 million to $159 million in 2020, compared with $138 million in the prior year and increased to 8.6% of net sales, compared with 8.1% of net sales one year ago. The $21 million increase in G&A expenses consisted of the following major components: (i) a $21 million increase in employee compensation primarily resulting from a year-over-year increase in Company-wide performance-based incentive compensation; and (ii) a $2 million increase in miscellaneous other expenses; partially offset by (iii) a $2 million decrease in travel and training expenses. The G&A expenses rate increased by 0.5 ppt. in the current-year period, compared with the same period one year ago due to the items discussed above, partially offset by the leveraging impact of the 9% net sales increase.
Research and development expenses
Research and development (R&D) expenses increased by 17% to $41 million in 2020, compared with $35 million in 2019. The R&D expense rate for 2020 increased to 2.2% of net sales, compared with 2.1% of net sales for the prior year. The 17% spending level increase supports our consumer innovation strategy.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net decreased to $9 million for the year ended January 2, 2021, compared with $12 million for the same period one year ago. The $3 million interest expense reduction was driven by lower average borrowings under credit facility in 2020 and a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding during 2020 compared with 2019.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense was $37 million for the year ended January 2, 2021, compared with $19 million for the same period one year ago. Both periods benefited from discrete tax items. The effective income tax rate for the year ended January 2, 2021 was 20.9% reflecting stock-based compensation excess tax benefits. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2019 was 18.6% reflecting stock-based compensation excess tax benefits, additional tax credits and the favorable resolution of a tax matter. See Note 11, Income Taxes, for further information.
Comparison of 2019 and 2018
For a discussion of our 2019 versus 2018 results, see our 2019 Form 10-K.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Managing our liquidity and capital resources is an important part of our commitment to deliver superior shareholder value over time. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March, government restrictions resulted in the temporary closure of most of our retail stores, with 47% of our retail stores on average closed during the three months ended June 27, 2020. Despite a 20% decline in net sales during the three months ended June 27, 2020, net sales increased 9% and net income increased by 70% in 2020 compared with 2019, and cash generated from operations increased 48%. Approximately 99% of our stores were open on average during the six months ended January 2, 2021. The actions below were taken to manage liquidity and capital resources during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our strong financial performance during the second half of 2020 has dramatically improved our risk profile and we have taken subsequent liquidity and capital deployment actions as a result.
•On September 24, 2020, we repaid the $75 million, 364-day term loan we added under our credit agreement on April 3, 2020. The $75 million term loan provided increased liquidity and preserved financial flexibility in consideration of the disruption and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 5, 2020, we amended the credit agreement to remove the share
repurchase restriction and eliminate the floor based on LIBOR of at least 0.75% from our $450 million credit agreement. Net liquidity available under our credit facility was $202 million at January 2, 2021.
•We resumed share repurchases under our Board-approved share repurchase program in October 2020, after it was temporarily suspended. We also reduced 2020 capital expenditures in response to COVID-19. We expect to return to a normalized amount of capital spending going forward.
•We negotiated rent deferrals and abatements for stores closed due to COVID-19.
•We furloughed nearly 40% of our team members with another 30% working reduced hours. The majority of our team members returned to work as stores reopened and customer demand increased. In response to changes in the business, we have restructured some teams, which resulted in approximately 10% of positions nationwide being eliminated as we reallocated headcount to support the changing needs of our business.
•We temporarily suspended the Company's 401(k) match and selected other benefit programs. In September 2020, we reinstated the discretionary 401(k) plan contributions for all of 2020.
•We also temporarily reduced our sales and marketing expenses, and most discretionary projects, while continuing to support our innovation initiatives. As our stores reopened and market conditions warranted, we increased our sales and marketing expenses, and restarted discretionary projects to support the future growth of business.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities and cash available under our $450 million revolving credit facility. As of January 2, 2021, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing other than our $4 million in outstanding letters of credit. The cash generated from ongoing operations and cash available under our revolving credit facility are expected to be adequate to maintain operations and fund anticipated expansion, strategic initiatives and contractual obligations such as lease payments and capital commitments for new retail store locations for the foreseeable future. See Notes 7, Leases, and 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for further details on our contractual obligations.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $4 million and $2 million at January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Significant changes in cash and cash equivalents during 2020 included $280 million of cash provided by operating activities, which were offset by $37 million of cash used to purchase property and equipment, $236 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock and a $12 million decrease in short-term borrowings.
The following table summarizes our cash flows (dollars in millions). Amounts may not add due to rounding differences:
Cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 was $280 million compared with $189 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019. Significant components of the $91 million year-over-year increase in cash from operating activities included: (i) a $57 million increase in net income in 2020 compared with 2019; (ii) a $31 million fluctuation in customer prepayments due to the strong recovery in customer demand during the last six months of 2020 that outperformed forecasts and suppliers' fulfillment, which had been curtailed to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic; (iii) a $27 million fluctuation in accounts payable with both years impacted by business changes and timing of payments; and (iv) a $24 million fluctuation in the amount of compensation and benefits accrued and timing of the related payments resulting from year-over-year changes in Company-wide performance-based incentive compensation.
Net cash used in investing activities was $39 million for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021, compared with $57 million in 2019. Investing activities in 2020 included $37 million of property and equipment purchases, compared with $59 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to actions taken to temporarily reduce capital spending based on the economic uncertainties associated with the pandemic.
Net cash used in financing activities was $238 million for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021, compared with $133 million in 2019. During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021, we repurchased $236 million of our common stock (based on settlement dates, $229 million under our Board-approved share repurchase program and $7 million in connection with the vesting of employee restricted stock grants), compared with $165 million in 2019. Short-term borrowings decreased by $12 million during 2020 due to a $13 million
increase in borrowings under our credit facility to $244 million, which was more than offset by a decrease in book overdrafts which are included in the net change in short-term borrowings. Short-term borrowings increased by $26 million during 2019 due to a $31 million increase in borrowings under our credit facility to $231 million, partially offset by a decrease in book overdrafts. Financing activities for both years reflect the cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.
Under our Board-approved share repurchase program, we repurchased 3.4 million shares at a cost of $228 million (based on trade dates, $66.49 per share) during the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021. During 2019, we repurchased 3.6 million shares at a cost of $146 million ($40.97 per share). As of January 2, 2021, the remaining authorization under our Board-approved share repurchase program was $247 million. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares.
As of January 2, 2021, we had $244 million of borrowings under our credit facility. We also had $4 million in outstanding letters of credit. Net liquidity available under our credit facility was $202 million at January 2, 2021. The credit agreement provides the lenders with a collateral security interest in substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries and requires us to comply with, among other things, a maximum leverage ratio (4.5x) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (3.0x). Our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement was 2.2x as of January 2, 2021. The credit agreement includes an accordion feature which allows us to increase the amount of the credit facility from $450 million to $600 million, subject to lenders' approval. Under the terms of the credit agreement, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our leverage ratio. The credit agreement is for general corporate purposes, to meet our seasonal working capital requirements and repurchase our common stock. As of January 2, 2021, the weighted-average interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility was 1.5% and we were in compliance with all financial covenants.
We have an agreement with Synchrony Bank to offer qualified customers revolving credit arrangements to finance purchases from us (Synchrony Agreement). The Synchrony Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio consistent with our Credit Agreement. As of January 2, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.
Under the terms of the Synchrony Agreement, Synchrony Bank sets the minimum acceptable credit ratings, the interest rates, fees and all other terms and conditions of the customers’ accounts, including collection policies and procedures, and is the owner of the accounts. As the accounts are owned by Synchrony Bank, at no time are the accounts purchased or acquired from us. We are not liable to Synchrony Bank for our customers’ credit defaults.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses and the related disclosures. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the accounting policies discussed below are the most critical because they require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates, and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.
Our critical accounting policies and estimates relate to stock-based compensation, warranty liabilities and revenue recognition.
Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results
Differ from Assumptions
Stock-Based Compensation
We have stock-based compensation plans, which include non-qualified stock options and stock awards.
See Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Shareholders’ Deficit, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs.
Option-pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the volatility of our stock price, future employee forfeiture rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates or future earnings adjustments.
Performance-based stock awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance targets. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense that could be material.
In addition, if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation. Finally, if the actual forfeiture rates, or the actual achievement of performance targets, are not consistent with the assumptions used, we could experience future earnings adjustments.
A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended January 2, 2021, would have affected net income by approximately $1.7 million in 2020.
Warranty Liabilities
We provide a limited warranty on most of the products we sell.
See Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our warranty program and liabilities.
The majority of our warranty claims are incurred within the first year. However, our warranty liability contains uncertainties because our warranty obligations cover an extended period of time. A revision of estimated claim rates or the projected cost of materials and freight associated with sending replacement parts to customers could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.
We have not made any material changes in our warranty liability assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our warranty liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% change in our warranty liability at January 2, 2021, would have affected net income by approximately $0.9 million in 2020.
Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results
Differ from Assumptions
Revenue Recognition
Certain accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events.
See Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 9, Revenue Recognition, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies.
Our estimates of sales returns contain uncertainties as actual sales return rates may vary from expected rates, resulting in adjustments to net sales in future periods. These adjustments could have an adverse effect on future results of operations. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our sales returns allowance during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales returns allowance. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to additional losses or gains in future periods.
A 10% change in our sales returns allowance at January 2, 2021 would have affected net income by approximately $1.9 million in 2020.
