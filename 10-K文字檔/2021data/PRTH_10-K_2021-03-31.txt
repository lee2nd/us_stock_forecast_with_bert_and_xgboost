Impact of COVID-19 on Results and Trends
The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, continues to adversely affect consumer activity and has contributed to a decline in many aspects of macroeconomic activity in 2020 compared to 2019. The largest impact we experienced was within our Consumer Payments reportable segment (“Consumer Payments”), which is described below.
Our results of operations for most of the first quarter of 2020 were not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic since the economic consequences of the pandemic did not begin to materially impact consumer payment transactions in the United States until the last half of March 2020. Beginning in mid-March, the pandemic began to negatively impact our daily merchant bankcard processing dollar values (“processing dollars”) as the pandemic spread across the United States and restrictive shelter in place requirements were instituted. From mid-March 2020 through the end of April 2020, we experienced a significant decline of approximately 35% in processing dollars as compared with the comparable weeks in 2019. As a result, our processing dollars grew only 1.7% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2019. In the second quarter of 2020 we experienced a 16.4% decline in processing dollars compared with the second quarter of 2019. However, within the second quarter of 2020, the decline in processing dollars was greatest in April. In May and June of 2020, as shelter in place restrictions began to be lifted, we experienced a rebound in processing dollars that continued through the third quarter. With increased economic activity in the third quarter of 2020, we experienced growth in processing dollars of 6.3% as compared with the third quarter of 2019.
The level of new COVID-19 cases began to increase significantly throughout the United States during the fourth quarter of 2020, with certain states impacted more than others, and pandemic related economic factors impacted the growth rate of our processing dollars. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced growth in processing dollars of 3.0% as compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, processing dollars in Consumer Payments of $41.7 billion declined 1.4% from $42.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Revenue growth in Consumer Payments was 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, revenue growth was 8.9%, 0.3%, 20.0% and 15.3%, respectively, compared with the comparable quarters in 2019. During 2020, we benefited from our specialized merchant acquiring program. This program, which complies with the recently issued card association rules, helped mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on overall revenue growth by adding $28.8 million to the Consumer Payments revenue in 2020, compared with $7.4 million in 2019.
In the first quarter of 2021, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States began to accelerate. While this may be a positive development, the future impact of the pandemic on the overall economy and our results are beyond our ability to predict or control.
Revenue
Consolidated revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our consolidated revenue increased by $32.5 million, or 8.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to $404.3 million. This overall increase was driven by a $37.2 million, or 11.3%, increase in revenue from our Consumer Payments segment and a $0.3 million, or 2.2%, increase in revenue from our Integrated Partners segment, partially offset by a $5.1 million, or 19.5%, decrease in revenue in our Commercial Payments segment.
Revenue in Consumer Payments segment
Consumer Payments revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $37.2 million, or 11.3%, compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $330.6 million. This increase was driven by $21.4 million, or 290.0%, revenue growth from our specialized merchant acquiring program.
Merchant bankcard processing dollar value for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $41.7 billion decreased by $0.6 billion, or 1.4%, compared to $42.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, our merchant volume mix drove a 10.8% higher average ticket of $91.61 in 2020 compared to $82.65 in 2019. Current economic factors have impacted the merchant volume mix, including shifts in payment transaction activity among certain vertical industries, spending trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic that appear to have resulted in consumers conducting fewer payment transactions at higher average transaction values, and an increase in card-not-present transactions. Card-not-present volume generally offers more favorable pricing to us than other types of transactions. The trend of new merchant boarding remains within our historical range of 4,500 to 5,000 new merchants per month. During 2020, our monthly average of new merchants boarded was 4,669 compared with 4,612 in 2019.
Revenue in Commercial Payments segment
Commercial Payments revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $20.9 million decreased by $5.1 million, or 19.5%, compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $26.0 million. The increase in revenue from our accounts payable automated solutions services was offset by a decrease in revenues from our curated managed services programs.
Revenue from our accounts payable automated solutions business in 2020 of $6.0 million increased $0.5 million, or 8.8%, compared to revenue in 2019 of $5.5 million. This increase was driven by increased business from existing customers. Revenue from our curated managed services business in 2020 of $14.9 million decreased by $5.5 million, or 27.1%, compared to revenue in 2019 of $20.5 million. This decrease was driven by a decline and curtailment in 2020 of a customer’s merchant financing program in response to the COVID related economic conditions and the changes in the customer's business model.
Revenue in Integrated Partners segment
Integrated Partners revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $15.6 million increased by $0.3 million, or 2.2%, compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $15.3 million. Priority Real Estate Technology, LLC ("PRET") comprised $13.4 million and $13.2 million of this segment's revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. PRET's RentPayment business, which was formed with a March 2019 asset acquisition, generated revenue of $12.0 million in 2020 and $11.7 million in 2019, respectively. Revenue from PRET’s RadPad and Landlord Station businesses, Priority PayRight Health Solutions ("PayRight") and Priority Hospitality Technology ("PHOT") comprised the remainder of this segment's revenue.
The sale of the RentPayment business in September 2020 as disclosed in Note 2, Disposal of Business, to the consolidated financial statements impacted our results after the third quarter of 2020 and will also impact the trend of future results of the Integrated Partners segment.
Consolidated Operating Expenses
Our consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $383.5 million increased by $18.8, or 5.2%, compared to consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $364.7 million. This overall increase was driven by higher costs of services and depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 compared to 2019. Costs of services of $277.4 million grew $24.8 million, or 9.8%, in 2020 resulting from higher revenues in the Consumer Payments segment. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of $40.8 million increased by $1.7 million, or 4.3%, in 2020, which was driven by additions to property, equipment and software, as well as intangible assets.
While costs of services and depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2020, we experienced decreases in salary and employee benefits and selling, general and administrative expenses compared to 2019. Consolidated salary and employee benefits expenses of $39.5 million decreased $2.7 million, or 6.4%, in 2020, which was driven by lower headcount and a $1.2 million decline in non-cash stock-based compensation. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses of $25.8 million decreased $5.0 million, or 16.1%, in 2020 driven by decreases in certain expenses management considers to be non-recurring in nature, lower office and travel-related costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased use of outside professionals due to in-sourcing of certain services, and an overall focus on cost containment.
Income (Loss) from Operations
Consolidated income from operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our consolidated income from operations increased by $13.7 million, or 190.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.9 million. This overall increase was driven by a $6.2 million, or 19.1%, increase income from operations in our Consumer Payments segment, a $1.8 million, or 203.6%, increase in income from operations in our Commercial Payments segment, and a $0.7 million, or 93.7%, increase in income from operations in our Integrated Partners segment. Corporate expense of $19.9 million in 2020 decreased by $5.0 million, or 20.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income from operations in Consumer Payments segment
Our Consumer Payments segment contributed $38.4 million of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.2 million, or 19.1%, from the $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was the result of higher revenue, net of costs of services, of $9.0 million, and lower salary and employee benefit expenses of $1.8 million driven by lower headcount and a $1.1 million decline in non-cash stock-based compensation. While these factors drove growth in income from operations, they were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was attributable to additions to intangible assets and property, equipment and software, while the growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to a $2.5 million increase in certain expenses management considers to be non-recurring in nature. Such expenses in 2020 totaled $1.9 million and are comprised of: $1.8 million for an impairment charge for an intangible asset and a $0.5 million allowance provision for a note receivable, partially offset by a non-cash reduction in expense of $0.4 million for a change in the fair value of accrued contingent consideration related to two 2018 business acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2019 included a non-cash reduction in expense of $0.6 million for a change in the fair value of accrued contingent consideration related to the same two 2018 business combinations.
Income (loss) from operations in Commercial Payments segment
Our Commercial Payments segment contributed $0.9 million of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss from operations of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This improvement was driven by a $1.9 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $0.8 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits expenses due to lower headcount and a $0.5 million decline in non-cash stock-based compensation. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was driven by reduced travel and trade show expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, selling, general and administrative expenses for 2019 included a $0.5 million allowance for uncollectible receivables which were substantially recovered in 2020. While these factors drove growth in income from operations, they were partially offset by the decline in revenue attributable to our curated managed services programs.
Income from operations in Integrated Partners segment
Our Integrated Partners segment contributed $1.4 million of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.7 million compared to $0.7 million of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by lower operating expenses attributable to a $0.8 million decrease in salary and employee benefit expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, and a $0.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2020 and 2019 are expenses related to transition services provided by YapStone, Inc. in connection with the assets acquired in March 2019 and sold in September 2020. These transition services were approximately $2.6 million in 2020 and $2.9 million in 2019. These operating expense decreases more than offset the increase in costs of services experienced in 2020, due in part to our new payment infrastructure as a service arrangement with the buyer of the RentPayment business.
Corporate Expense
Corporate expenses were $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 20.2%, from expenses of $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in 2020 was driven by a $5.3 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $0.4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, partially
offset by a $0.6 million increase in salary and employee benefits expense largely attributable to a $0.4 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020 are certain legal and professional expenses management considers to be non-recurring in nature of $1.9 million, offset by litigation settlement income of $0.7 million. Such expenses in 2019 totaled of $6.4 million, offset by litigation settlement income of $0.4 million.
Interest Expense
The amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts, as well as certain administrative fees, increased our reported consolidated interest expense and the effective interest rates under our Senior and Subordinated Credit Agreements.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, consolidated interest expense increased by $4.2 million, or 10.3%, to $44.8 million from $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The additional expense in 2020 was due to increases in the applicable margins on the Senior and Subordinated Credit Agreements that resulted from the Sixth Amendment in March 2020 and increased borrowings under the revolving credit portion of our Senior Credit Agreement, partially offset by a $106.5 million principal prepayment in late September 2020 of the term portion of our Senior Credit Agreement. For 2020, the effective interest rates on the term facility of our Senior and Subordinated Credit Agreements averaged 8.5% and 13.0%, respectively, compared to 7.2% and 10.8%, respectively, for 2019. Based on applicable margins and the LIBOR rate in effect on December 31, 2020, we expect the effective interest rates on the term facility of our Senior and Subordinated Credit Agreements to be approximately 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively, in 2021.
Debt Extinguishment and Modification Expenses
During September 2020, we wrote off unamortized deferred debt costs and discounts of $1.5 million associated with the $106.5 million principal prepayment for the term facility under our Senior Credit Agreements. In the first quarter of 2020, we expensed $0.4 million of third-party costs incurred in connection with the Sixth Amendment to the Senior and Subordinated Credit Agreements.
Gain on Sale of Business
As disclosed in Note 2, Disposal of Business, to the consolidated financial statements, during late September 2020 our consolidated PRET subsidiary sold the RentPayment business, which is substantially all of the assets acquired from YapStone, Inc. in March 2019. Based on efforts and changes made by us since the March 2019 acquisition of these assets, the assets constituted a business, as defined by GAAP, when sold in September 2020 for $179.4 million, net of a working capital adjustment. After removing the carrying values of the disposed business and incurring costs related to the transaction, PRET recognized a pre-tax gain of $107.2 million. PRET had non-controlling interests ("NCIs"), and based on the cash waterfall provisions in PRET's governing agreement, the NCIs were entitled to $45.1 million of the $107.2 million pre-tax gain, which is included in Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $45.1 million was distributed in cash to the NCIs, and the $45.1 million of payments along with the $5.7 million redemption payment made to one of the NCIs, resulted in the redemption of all NCIs of PRET. The working capital adjustment and the allocation of net proceeds described above remain subject to final adjustment with the buyer and PRET members, respectively. Any remaining payments made or received by the Company will be recorded in the period in which such amounts are finalized.
Other, net
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Other, net was composed primarily of interest income earned on notes receivable from certain independent sales organizations and another entity.
Income Tax Expense
We became part of a C-Corporation reporting tax group on July 25, 2018 in connection with the Business Combination. On July 25, 2018, we recognized a net deferred income tax asset of $47.5 million, which also resulted in a credit to our additional paid-in capital within our consolidated stockholders' deficit. The net deferred tax asset is the result of the difference between the initial tax bases in the assets and liabilities and their respective carrying amounts for financial statement purposes.
We assess all available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), requires that all sources of future taxable income be considered in making this determination. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 amended section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 163(j), as amended, limits the business interest deduction to 30% of adjusted taxable income ("ATI"). For taxable years through 2021, the calculation of ATI closely aligns with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). Commencing in 2022, the ATI limitation more closely aligns with earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), without adjusting for depreciation and amortization. Any business interest in excess of the annual limitation is carried forward indefinitely. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was enacted, which among other provisions, provides for the increase of the 163(j) ATI limitation from 30% to 50% for tax years 2019 and 2020.
With respect to recording a deferred tax benefit for the carryforward of business interest expense, GAAP applies a "more likely than not" threshold for assessing recoverability. Adjustments to the valuation allowance are a component of income tax expense (benefit) in our statements of operations. An increase in the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes will increase income tax expense (or reduce an otherwise income tax benefit), and a decrease in the valuation allowance will decrease income tax expense (or increase an otherwise income tax benefit).
On the basis of our assessment, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we decreased and increased the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes by $2.9 million and $9.3 million, respectively, associated with excess business interest for the then-current reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance for 2018 were not material. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of the net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis and, as a result, the valuation allowance may change in future periods.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our consolidated income tax expense was $10.9 million, resulting in a consolidated effective income tax rate of 13.3%. Approximately $12.3 million of consolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the gain on the business sale (see Note 2, Disposal of Business). For the year ended December 31, 2019, our consolidated income tax expense was $0.8 million, resulting in an effective consolidated income tax benefit rate of 2.5%. See Note 11, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our consolidated effective income tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to timing and permanent differences between amounts calculated under GAAP and the tax code. The consolidated effective income tax rate for 2020 may not be indicative of our effective tax rate for future periods.
Earnings Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests (NCIs)
In addition to the $45.1 million discussed above for the NCIs of PRET, we attributed and paid $250 thousand to the NCIs of PHOT for the year ended December 31, 2020. No amounts were attributable or paid to any NCIs in prior years. See Note 4, Asset Acquisitions, Asset Contributions, and Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements.
Net Income (Loss)
Consolidated net income attributable to the stockholders of Priority Technology Holdings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $25.7 million compared to a net loss of $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 for the aforementioned reasons.

Revenue
Consolidated revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our consolidated revenue decreased by $4.0 million, or 1.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2018 to $371.9 million. This decrease was driven by a $16.4 million, or 4.7%, decrease in revenue from our Consumer Payments segment and a $1.1 million, or 4.0%, decrease in revenue from our Commercial Payments segment, partially offset by a $13.5 million increase in revenue from our Integrated Partners segment. Consolidated merchant bankcard processing dollar value and merchant bankcard transactions increased 12.7% and 10.2%, respectively.
Revenue in Consumer Payments segment
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the $16.4 million decrease in Consumer Payments revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue of $51.9 million from certain subscription-billing e-commerce merchants, largely offset by revenue resulting from the overall increases in merchant bankcard processing dollar value and merchant bankcard transactions of 11.6% and 9.9%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The higher merchant bankcard processing dollar value and transaction volume in 2019 were mainly due to the continuation of higher consumer spending trends in 2019 and positive net onboarding of new merchants. Additionally, the average dollar amount per bankcard transaction increased to $82.65, or 1.5%, in 2019 from $81.39 in 2018.
Our revenue in the Consumer Payments segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was negatively affected by the closure of high-margin accounts with certain subscription-billing e-commerce merchants. The closure of merchants in this channel was due to industry-wide changes for enhanced card association compliance. This revenue was $7.4 million and $59.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Revenue in Commercial Payments segment
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the $1.1 million decrease in Commercial Payments revenue was attributable to a $2.3 million decrease in revenue from our curated managed services program, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in revenue from our accounts payable automated solutions. The managed services decline was largely driven by lower incentive revenue and the accounts payable automated solutions increase was driven by customer additions and higher merchant bankcard processing dollar value.
Revenue in Integrated Partners segment
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the $13.5 million increase in our Integrated Partners revenue was due primarily to a $12.3 million increase in revenue from PRET. PRET's revenue growth included $11.7 million from a March 2019 asset acquisition. Revenue from PayRight and PHOT, which commenced operations in April 2018 and February 2019, respectively, comprised the remainder of this reportable segment’s $1.2 million revenue growth.
Consolidated Operating Expenses
Our consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $364.7 million increased by $5.2 million, or 1.5%, from consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $359.4 million. This overall increase was driven primarily by a $19.4 million, or 98.0%, increase in amortization and depreciation expense related to asset acquisitions that occurred in late 2018 and 2019. Consolidated salary and employee benefits increased $3.9 million, or 10.2%, related to increases in corporate and operations headcount and higher headcount from business and asset acquisitions in 2019 and 2018, as well as a $2.0 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation in 2019 compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by a $16.7 million, or 6.2%, decrease in consolidated costs of services in correlation with lower revenues in 2019 and due to lower residual expenses in 2019 resulting from buyouts of residual commission rights in 2019 and 2018. Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $1.3 million, or 4.0%, driven by a decrease in certain
expenses management considers to be non-recurring in nature related to transaction costs associated with the Business Combination and conversion to a public company, such as legal, accounting and other advisory and consulting expenses. These expenses were $8.3 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Income (Loss) from Operations
Consolidated income from operations
Consolidated income from operations decreased $9.2 million, or 56.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Our consolidated operating margin for year ended December 31, 2019 was 1.9% compared to 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The consolidated margin decrease was the result of higher depreciation and amortization expense of $19.4 million and a $3.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by lower costs of services of $16.7 million and a $1.3 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Income from operations in Consumer Payments segment
Our Consumer Payments reportable segment earned $32.2 million in income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $14.8 million, or 31.4%, from $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease largely reflected the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $14.9 million in 2019 related to asset acquisitions that occurred in late 2018 and 2019. The loss of certain subscription-billing e-commerce merchants in 2019 due to industry-wide changes for enhanced card association compliance, which contributed $3.5 million and $21.3 million of income from operations in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was largely offset by income resulting from the growth in merchant bankcard processing dollar value and transaction volume.
Loss from operations in Commercial Payments segment
Our Commercial Payments reportable segment incurred a $0.9 million loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a $1.0 million loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. This improvement was driven by a $0.6 million increase in revenue, net of costs of services, partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits and selling, general and administrative expenses, which included a $0.5 million allowance for uncollectible receivables in 2019 which were substantially recovered in 2020.
Income (loss) from operations in Integrated Partners segment
Our Integrated Partners segment earned income from operations of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss from operations of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in income from operations in 2019 was due primarily to a 2019 asset acquisition, which included $4.0 million of increased depreciation expense and $2.9 million of transitional acquisition integration costs.
Corporate Expense
Corporate expenses were $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 10.1%, over expenses of $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by a $6.4 million decrease in certain expenses management considers to be non-recurring in nature that were associated with our Business Combination, conversion to a public company, and certain legal matters. These expenses were $6.0 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Interest Expense
Consolidated interest expense, including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and discounts, increased by $10.7 million, or 35.8%, to $40.7 million in 2019 from $29.9 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher debt obligations in 2019 driven by acquisition-related borrowings.
Other, net
Other, net increased $7.5 million from a net expense of $6.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to net income of $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2018 amount included $3.5 million expense from the change in fair value of a prior warrant liability and $3.3 million of debt modification and other net costs.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
We became part of a C-Corporation reporting tax group on July 25, 2018 in connection with the Business Combination. On July 25, 2018, we recognized a net deferred income tax asset of $47.5 million, which also resulted in a credit to our additional paid-in capital within our consolidated stockholders' deficit. The net deferred tax asset is the result of the difference between the initial tax bases in the assets and liabilities and their respective carrying amounts for financial statement purposes.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our consolidated income tax expense was $0.8 million, resulting in an effective consolidated income tax benefit rate of 2.5%. See Note 11, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our consolidated income tax benefit was $2.5 million, resulting in an effective consolidated income tax rate of 12.5%. This income tax benefit was based on the pre-tax loss incurred after July 25, 2018. On a pro-forma basis assuming C-Corporation status for the full year 2018, our income tax benefit would have been $3.2 million, resulting in a pro-forma effective income tax rate of 15.6%. Our annualized pro-forma effective income tax rate for 2018 was less than the statutory rate due to timing and permanent differences between amounts calculated under GAAP and the tax code.
Net loss
Our consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $33.6 million compared to a net loss of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 for the aforementioned reasons.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity and capital resource management is a process focused on providing the funding we need to meet our short-term and long-term cash and working capital needs. We have used our funding sources to build our merchant portfolio, technology solutions, and to make acquisitions with the expectation that such investments will generate cash flows sufficient to cover our working capital needs and other anticipated needs, including for our acquisition strategy. We anticipate that cash on hand, funds generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Our principal uses of cash are to fund business operations, administrative costs, and debt service.
Our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was a negative $13.0 million at December 31, 2020 and a positive $1.2 million at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash totaling $9.2 million compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2019. These cash balances do not include restricted cash of $78.9 million and $47.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which reflects cash accounts holding customer settlement funds and cash reserves for potential losses at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The current portion of long-term debt included in current liabilities was $19.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared with $4.0 million at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, we had availability of approximately $25.0 million under our revolving credit arrangement.
The following tables and narrative reflect our changes in cash flows for the comparative annual periods.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities, which includes restricted cash, was $47.1 million and $39.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $7.7 million, or 19.6%, increase in 2020 was principally the result of an increase in restricted cash balances, as well as an increase in cash generated from operations, partially offset by changes in assets and liabilities and the payment of $5.4 million of transaction costs related to the sale of the RentPayment business in 2020.
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $166.4 million compared to cash used of $97.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used in investing activities includes cash for the acquisitions of merchant portfolios, residual buyouts, and purchases of property, equipment and software. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we invested $5.6 million and $82.9 million, respectively, in merchant portfolios and residual buyouts. Cash used for purchases of property, equipment, and software for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.5 million compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For 2020, cash used for investing activities was offset by cash received of $179.4 million from the sale of the RentPayment business. See Note 2, Disposal of Business, in Item 8 of the Annual report on Form 10-K.
Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $175.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to cash provided of $75.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The amount for 2020 included $110.5 million in principal repayments on the term facility for our Senior Credit Agreement, $51.1 million of cash payments to the non-controlling interests of PRET and PHOT, and repayment of the revolving facility under our Senior Credit Agreement. The amount for 2019 included net borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement consisting of $11.5 million under the revolving facility and a $69.7 million delayed draw under the term facility that was used to acquire certain assets from YapStone, Inc. in March 2019.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $39.4 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $8.0 million, or 25.6%, increase in 2019 was principally the result of increases in restricted cash balances and cash generated from operations, partially offset by changes in assets and liabilities in 2019.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $97.7 million and $108.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash flow used in investing activities includes the acquisitions of merchant portfolios, residual buyouts, purchases of property, equipment and software, and acquisitions of businesses. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we invested $82.9 million and $90.9 million, respectively, in merchant portfolios and residual buyouts. We used $0.2 million for business acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $7.5 million in 2018. Cash used for purchases of property, equipment, and software for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $11.1 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in purchases was driven primarily by capitalization of internally developed software.
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $75.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $67.3 million in 2018. Cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 resulted primarily from proceeds received from additional borrowings under our term debt in and revolving credit facility. Proceeds received in 2018 also included cash received from the Business Combination and equity recapitalization.
Long-Term Debt
As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding long-term debt, excluding amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, of $382.0 million compared to $484.0 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $101.9 million. The debt balance consisted of outstanding term debt of $279.4 million under the Senior Credit Facility and $102.6 million in term debt under the Subordinated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (the "GS Credit Facility") including accrued payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest through December 31, 2020. Additionally, under the Senior Credit Facility, we have a $25.0 million revolving credit facility, which had $11.5 million drawn and outstanding as of December 31, 2019. There were no such amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The outstanding principal amounts under the Senior Credit Facility and the Subordinated GS Credit Facility mature in January 2023 and July 2023, respectively. The $25 million revolving credit facility expires in January 2022.
The Senior Credit Facility and the subordinated GS Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, however, the parent entity, Priority Technology Holdings, Inc., is neither a borrower nor guarantor to the Senior Credit Facility or the GS Credit Facility.
On March 18, 2020, we modified the Senior Credit Agreement and the GS Credit Amendment (collectively, the "Sixth Amendment"). As of December 31, 2020, financial covenants, as amended, under the Senior Credit Facility required the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, not to exceed 7.75:1.00 at December 31, 2020. The Total Net Leverage Ratio steps down thereafter.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. Noncompliance in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, including giving the lenders the right to accelerate the debt repayment schedule and restricting access to the revolving credit facility. Based upon current projections, the Company expects to be in compliance with its debt covenants for at least the foreseeable future. For additional information about the risks associated with our debt agreements and related covenants, refer to the "Risk Factors Related to Our Indebtedness" in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt, and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are defined in Section 1.01 of Exhibit A to the Sixth Amendment (incorporated Exhibits 10.3.4 and 10.4.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and summarized below:
•The Total Net Leverage Ratio means, at any date of determination, the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt for such date, to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.
•Consolidated Total Debt is the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness minus the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash at the balance sheet date.
•Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is consolidated net income plus any applicable items determined in accordance with clauses (i)(b) through (i)(v) of the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA definition, minus any applicable items determined in accordance with clauses (ii)(a) through (ii)(g) of the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA definition in Section 1.01 of the Sixth Amendment ("Applicable Adjustments").
Under the provisions of the Sixth Amendment, calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA at each interim quarterly measurement period in 2020 is determined as the current year-to-date Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA annualized. For interim quarterly and full year measurement periods commencing in January 2021, calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is determined on a last twelve months basis.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP liquidity measure. For determining the Total Net Leverage Ratio at December 31, 2020, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was calculated as follows in accordance with the referenced clause definitions from Section 1.01 of the Sixth Amendment:
At December 31, 2020, the Total Net Leverage Ratio was 5.85:1.00, calculated as follows:
Contractual Obligations
The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2020.
(a) Reflects contractual principal payments on term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and excludes any amount for the revolving credit facility which had no outstanding balance at December 31, 2020. Does not include future "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") interest that will be added to the principal outstanding for the GS Credit Facility as this interest is included in Interest on debt in (b). See Note 10, Long-Term Debt and Warrant Liability.
(b) Reflects interest payable and future PIK interest on term debt under the Senior Credit Facility and the subordinated GS Credit Facility. Amounts based on outstanding balances and interest rates as of December 31, 2020. Does not include any interest that may be payable in the future for the revolving credit facility which had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020. See Note 10, Long-Term Debt and Warrant Liability.
(c) Reflects amount accrued for earned contingent consideration for asset acquisition. See Note 4, Asset Acquisitions, Asset Contributions, and Business Combinations.
(d) Reflects minimum annual spend commitments with third-party processor partners. In the event we fail to meet the minimum annual spend commitment, we are required to pay the difference between the minimum and the actual dollar amount spent in the year. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies.
Based on outstanding principal balances, including PIK interest, at December 31, 2020 approximately 73% of the Borrowers' $382 million of term debt matures in January 2023 and approximately 27% matures in July 2023. Based on current market conditions and the financial conditions and forecasts of the entities and guarantors that compose the Borrowers, we currently believe the term debt can be refinanced on or before the maturity dates at amounts and terms that are similar or favorable to those existing at December 31, 2020.
On March 5, 2021, we entered into a debt commitment letter with Truist Bank and Truist Securities, Inc., pursuant to which Truist has committed to provide Priority with a new Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, which will replace existing Senior Loan facilities. Also, on March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a preferred stock commitment letter with Ares Capital Management LLC and Ares Alternative Credit Management LLC to issue preferred stock, the proceeds of which will be partially used to repay our Subordinated Debt Facility. See Note 21, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions with third parties or unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or other obligations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, Nature of Business and Accounting Policies. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments.
Revenue Recognition
We adopted the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective for the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2019. We used the full retrospective adoption and transition method, and accordingly, all periods presented in this Form 10-K reflect the provisions of ASC 606.
Under the provisions of ASC 606, we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a service or good to the customer in an amount to which we expect to be entitled (i.e., transaction price) allocated to the distinct or services or goods.
At contract inception, we assess the services and goods promised in our contracts with customers and identify the performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a service or good that is distinct. For substantially all of our services, the nature of our promise to the customer is to stand ready to accept and process the transactions that customers request on a daily basis over the contract term. Since the timing and quantity of transactions to be processed is not determinable, the services comprise an obligation to stand ready to process as many transactions as the customer requires. Under a stand-ready obligation, the evaluation of the nature of our performance obligation is focused on each time increment rather than the underlying activities. Therefore, we have determined that our services comprise a series of distinct days of service that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Accordingly, the promise to stand ready is accounted for as a single-series performance obligation.
When third parties are involved in the transfer of services or goods to the customer, we consider the nature of each specific promised service or good and applies judgment to determine whether we control the service or good before it is transferred to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent of the third party. We follow the requirements of ASC 606-10, Principal Agent Considerations, which states that the determination of whether an entity should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. To determine whether or not we control the service or good, we assess indicators including: 1) whether we or the third party is primarily responsible for fulfillment; 2) if we or the third party provides a significant service of integrating two or more services or goods into a combined item that is a service or good that the customer contracted to receive; 3) which party has discretion in determining pricing for the service or good; and 4) other considerations deemed to be applicable to the specific situation.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on the weight of available evidence, including expected future earnings.
We recognize an uncertain tax position in our financial statements when we conclude that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits. Only after a tax position passes the first step of recognition will measurement be required. Under the measurement step, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement. This is determined on a cumulative probability basis. The full impact of any change in recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which such change occurs. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets
We test goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units on an annual basis or when events occur, or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting may be below its carrying value. We may perform a quantitative assessment that uses market data and discounted cash flow analysis, which involve estimates of future revenues and operating cash flows. Where deemed appropriate, we may perform the annual assessment using the optional qualitative method. Effective for the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2020, we voluntarily changed the date for our annual goodwill impairment assessment from November 30 to October 1. Both dates occur in our fourth quarter. We believe this prospective change does not represent a material change to a method of applying an accounting principle, even though the carrying value of goodwill is material to our consolidated financial statements. This change had no effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows for any reporting period. By using the October 1 annual assessment date, we believe that we will be able to utilize more readily available data from both internal and external sources and have additional time to evaluate the data prior to finalizing our year-end consolidated financial statements and disclosures. This change in the date for the annual impairment assessment for goodwill does not change our requirements to assess goodwill on an interim date between scheduled annual testing dates if triggering events are present.
We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, except goodwill, an impairment loss is indicated when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset group are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset group.
We amortize the cost of our acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using either a straight-line or an accelerated method that most accurately reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits of the respective asset is consumed.
Potential Impacts of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For the potential impacts that pending adoptions of recently issued accounting standards may have on our future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1, Nature of Business and Accounting Policies, under the header "Recently Issued Standards Not Yet Adopted."
