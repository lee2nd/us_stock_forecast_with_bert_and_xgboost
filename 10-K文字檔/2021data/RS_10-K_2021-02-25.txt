Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the Company’s business under Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
While our financial results in 2020 decreased from record levels in 2019 largely due to challenging economic circumstances as a result of COVID-19, we believe that our results demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business model.
Certain key results for 2020 included the following:
● Net sales of $8.81 billion in 2020, down $2.16 billion, or 19.7%, from $10.97 billion in 2019 due to a 10.8% decline in tons sold and 9.6% decline in our average selling price per ton sold;
● Record gross profit margin of 31.5% (or 31.9%, excluding the impact of $38.2 million of restructuring charges) in 2020 eclipsed our prior record gross profit margin of 30.3% in 2019;
● Record quarterly gross profit margin of 33.0% (or 32.9%, excluding the impact of $1.4 million of restructuring credits) in the fourth quarter of 2020;
● Same-store selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in 2020 declined $241.0 million, or 11.5%, from 2019, consistent with the 10.8% decline in our tons sold;
● Pretax income of $478.2 million, down $451.1 million, or 48.5%, from record pretax income of $929.3 million in 2019. Pretax income margin of 5.4% in 2020 compared to 8.5% in 2019. Pretax income in 2020 was negatively impacted by $179.0 million of non-recurring charges that reduced pretax income margin 2.1 percentage points and were substantially comprised of impairment and restructuring and postretirement plan settlement charges;
● Earnings per diluted share of $5.66 decreased $4.68, or 45.3%, from record earnings per share of $10.34 in 2019, mainly due to impairment and restructuring charges and other non-recurring items that reduced earnings per diluted share by $2.05, or 26.6%, in 2020;
● Cash provided by operations of $1.17 billion decreased $128.5 million or 9.9%, from record $1.30 billion in 2019;
● $164.1 million of dividends and $337.3 million of share repurchases in 2020 compared to $151.3 million of dividends and $50.0 million of share repurchases in 2019; and
● We achieved our inventory turn rate (based on tons) goal of 4.7 times for 2020.
Our net sales were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower tons sold and a lower average selling price per ton sold as a result of the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on nearly all of the end markets we serve.
We continue to successfully generate strong gross profit margins during periods of economic strength and weakness, and during increasing and declining metal pricing cycles. This is due in part to our significant capital expenditure investments, that have totaled nearly $1 billion over the past five years, with approximately 50% spent on processing equipment, and the outstanding performance by our managers in the field who, despite the challenging circumstances in 2020, continued to maintain pricing discipline by focusing on specialty products and higher margin orders. Over the past six years, our capital expenditure investments drove the increase in the percentage of our orders that include value-added processing from 45% in 2014 to 51% in 2019 (600 basis points) that decreased to 49% in 2020 due to shifts in the mix of our products sold as a result of the pandemic, contributing to the 640 basis point increase in our gross profit margin from 25.1% in 2014 to our record gross profit margin of 31.5% in 2020.
In the third quarter of 2020, we strengthened our liquidity position and extended our debt maturity profile through a $900.0 million senior notes offering and amendment and restatement of our $1.5 billion credit agreement. We used the majority of the proceeds from the notes offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings on our credit agreement.
Our same-store selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in 2020 declined $241.0 million, or 11.5%, from 2019 mainly due to our temporary and permanent workforce reduction actions in response to lower demand levels and decreases in incentive compensation attributable to COVID-19. Our same-store SG&A expense as a percentage of sales during 2020 was higher than our 2019 percentage due to our lower sales levels.
During 2020, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of $157.8 million mainly due to a $137.5 million impairment and restructuring charge we recognized in the first quarter of 2020 resulting from closures of certain energy-related businesses (oil and natural gas) and our reduced long-term outlook for certain of our remaining energy-related businesses, COVID-19 downsizing at certain of our businesses, our revised negative outlook and facility closures for certain businesses serving the commercial aerospace market as a result of a decline in commercial airplane build rates. See Note 19 - “Impairment and Restructuring Charges” of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on our 2020 impairment and restructuring charges.
As a result of our record gross profit margin, diligent expense control and rightsizing our inventory, we generated strong cash flow from operations during 2020 of $1.17 billion, which decreased from record cash flow from operations of $1.30 billion in 2019 but was significantly higher than the $664.6 million generated in 2018. We also remain committed to concurrently making investments that support the long-term growth and sustainability of our company as well as continuing to provide returns to our stockholders. We believe our sources of liquidity and access to capital markets will continue to be adequate for the foreseeable future to fund operations, finance strategic growth initiatives, pay dividends, and execute opportunistic purchases under our share repurchase program.
We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of future impacts of COVID-19 on our business, but given the dynamic nature of these unprecedented circumstances, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance.
We believe that our broad end market exposure, diverse product offerings, focus on small order sizes, when-needed delivery, significant value-added processing capabilities along with our wide geographic footprint will enable us to persevere during these difficult and uncertain times. We believe that these business model characteristics combined with pricing discipline, our strategy of concentrating on higher margin business differentiate us from our industry peers and will allow us to continue achieving industry-leading results.
Effect of Demand and Pricing Changes on our Operating Results
Customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations. When volume increases, our revenue dollars generally increase, which contributes to increased gross profit dollars. Variable costs also increase with volume, primarily our warehouse, delivery, selling, general and administrative expenses. Conversely, when volume declines, we typically produce fewer revenue dollars, which can reduce our gross profit dollars. We can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline, but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs.
Pricing for our products generally has a much more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels. Our revenues generally increase in conjunction with pricing increases as customer demand is not usually impacted by typical mill pricing increases. Our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increase. We are typically able to pass higher prices on to our customers. If prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage, we generate higher levels of gross profit and pretax income dollars for the same operational efforts. Conversely, if pricing declines, we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pretax income dollars. Because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure other than for profit-based compensation, the impact on our results of operations from changes in pricing is typically much greater than the effect of volume changes.
In addition, when volume or pricing increases, our working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventories) requirements typically increase, resulting in lower levels of cash flow from operations, which may also require us to increase our outstanding debt and incur higher interest expense. Conversely, when customer demand falls, our operations typically generate increased cash flow as our working capital needs decrease.
Acquisitions
2019 Acquisition
On December 31, 2019, we acquired Fry Steel Company (“Fry Steel”). Fry Steel is a general line and long bar distributor located in Santa Fe Springs, California. Fry Steel performs cutting services on its diverse product assortment and provides “in-stock” next day delivery of its products. Fry Steel’s net sales in 2020 were $76.1 million.
2018 Acquisitions
On November 1, 2018, we acquired All Metals Holding, LLC, including its operating subsidiaries All Metals Processing & Logistics, Inc. and All Metals Transportation and Logistics, Inc. (collectively, “All Metals”). All Metals is headquartered in Spartanburg, South Carolina with an additional facility in Cartersville, Georgia. All Metals specializes in toll processing for automotive, construction, appliance and other end markets, and provides value-added transportation and logistics services for metal products from six strategically located terminals throughout the southeastern United States. All Metals’ net sales in 2020 were $25.3 million.
On August 1, 2018, we acquired KMS Fab, LLC and KMS South, Inc. (collectively, “KMS” or the “KMS Companies”). The KMS Companies are headquartered in Luzerne, Pennsylvania. The KMS Companies specialize in precision sheet metal fabrication ranging from prototypes to large production runs which utilize a wide variety of metals and fabrication methods including laser cutting, stamping, turret punching, machining, powder coating and welding. KMS’ net sales in 2020 were $18.8 million.
On March 1, 2018, we acquired DuBose National Energy Services, Inc. (“DuBose Energy”) and its affiliate, DuBose National Energy Fasteners & Machined Parts, Inc. (“DuBose Fasteners” and, together with DuBose Energy, “DuBose”). DuBose is headquartered in Clinton, North Carolina. DuBose specializes in fabrication, supply and distribution of metal and metal products to the nuclear industry, including utilities, component manufacturers and contractors. DuBose’s net sales in 2020 were $47.4 million.
Purchase of Noncontrolling Partnership Interests
On March 31, 2020, we purchased the remaining 49% noncontrolling interest of Feralloy Processing Company, an Indiana partnership (“FPC”) and toll processor in Portage, Indiana, which increased our ownership from 51% to 100%. FPC performs metal services such as leveling and cut-to-length processing of flat rolled products for a variety of industries including agriculture, machinery and equipment and pressurized tanks. We have consolidated the financial results of FPC since August 1, 2008 when we acquired Feralloy Corporation as part of our acquisition of PNA Group, Inc.
On October 23, 2018, we purchased the remaining 40% noncontrolling interest of Acero Prime, a toll processor in Mexico, which increased our ownership from 60% to 100%. Acero Prime, headquartered in San Luis Potosi, has four toll processing locations. Acero Prime performs metal processing services such as slitting, multi-blanking and oxy-fuel cutting, as well as storage and supply-chain management for a variety of different industries including automotive, home appliance, lighting, HVAC, machinery and heavy equipment. We have consolidated the financial results of Acero Prime since October 1, 2014 when we acquired a controlling interest.
Internal Growth Activities
We continued to maintain our focus on internal growth by opening new facilities, building or expanding existing facilities, adding and upgrading processing equipment, improving the safety of our operations and enhancing the working environments of our employees. Our capital expenditure budgets have been at historically high levels in recent years. Our 2021 capital expenditure budget is $245 million; however we expect our 2021 actual capital expenditures will be higher due to additional spending on projects carried forward from our 2020 budget.
We have made significant capital expenditure investments that have totaled nearly $1 billion over the past five years. In 2020, we performed value-added processing on 49% of the orders we shipped, significantly higher than our historical
rate of approximately 40%. These significant investments have expanded our value added processing capabilities that our managers in the field have successfully leveraged to increase the percentage of our orders with value added processing, which has significantly contributed to our record gross profit margin of 31.5% that is 640 basis points higher than our gross profit of 25.1% in 2014.
We believe that our ability to finance our investments in processing equipment and facilities provides a competitive advantage for us, as we can provide our customers with a higher quality product and expand our services to them, which we believe many of our competitors do not have the ability to provide.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the last three years ended December 31, 2020 (dollars are shown in millions and certain percentages may not calculate due to rounding):
(1) Gross profit, calculated as net sales less cost of sales, and gross profit margin, calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude depreciation and amortization expense associated with the corresponding sales. About half of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed. For the remainder of our sales orders, we perform “first-stage” processing, which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size. Because of this, the amount of related labor and overhead, including depreciation and amortization, is not significant and is excluded from cost of sales. Therefore, our cost of sales is substantially comprised of the cost of the material we sell. We use gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance. Gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures as their fluctuations can have a significant impact on our earnings. Gross profit and gross profit margin, as presented, are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies.
(2) SG&A includes $0.9 million and $19.1 million of gains related to the sale of non-core property, plant and equipment in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(3) See “Expenses” below for discussion of our impairment charges.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net Sales
Tons sold and average selling price per ton sold amounts exclude our toll processing sales. Same-store amounts exclude the results of our 2019 acquisition.
Our net sales were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower tons sold and a lower average selling price per ton sold.
Our same-store tons sold decreased 10.9% in 2020 compared to 2019, despite one additional shipping day in 2020, due to the significant decline in demand for the products we sell as a result of COVID-19.
Demand for the products we sell was lower in 2020 compared to 2019 for nearly all the end markets we serve as a result of the adverse impacts of COVID-19.
Demand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market fell sharply in the first half of 2020, declining 28.6%, but rebounded significantly in the second half of 2020 as many automotive OEMs and steel and aluminum mills supplying the automotive industry re-opened in the third quarter of 2020 following COVID-19-related shutdowns, with our total toll processing volumes down only 15.7% in 2020 compared to 2019 and returning to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2020. Demand in nonresidential construction (including infrastructure), our largest end market served, and heavy industry (agricultural, construction and mining equipment) markets were lower in 2020 compared to 2019, with demand improving at the end of 2020. In the aerospace end market, demand in the military, defense and space portions of the market was strong in 2020; however, commercial aerospace demand decreased as a direct result of reduced air travel due to COVID-19, with demand softness continuing at the end of 2020. Demand for the products we sell to the energy (oil and natural gas) end market was under considerable pressure during 2020 and we closed certain locations servicing this end market in 2020 and recorded significant impairment and restructuring charges.
Since we primarily purchase and sell our inventories in the spot market, the changes in our average selling prices generally fluctuate in accordance with the changes in the costs of the various metals we purchase. The mix of products sold can also have an impact on our average selling prices.
Our same-store average selling price per ton sold in 2020 was lower than 2019, mainly due to mill price decreases on many of the carbon steel products we sell. Our same-store average selling price per ton sold had declined sequentially for eight straight quarters through the third quarter of 2020, but increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 mainly due to mill price increases on most of the carbon steel products we sell. As carbon steel sales represent approximately 51% of our gross sales dollars, changes in carbon steel prices have the most significant impact on changes in our overall average selling price per ton sold.
Our major commodity selling prices changed year-over-year from 2019 to 2020 as follows:
Cost of Sales
The decrease in cost of sales in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly due to lower tons sold and a lower cost per ton sold. See “Net Sales” above for trends in both demand and costs of our products.
Cost of sales in 2020 included $38.2 million of net inventory provisions relating to the planned closure of certain operations. See Note 19 -“Impairment and Restructuring Charges” of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on our 2020 restructuring charges.
In addition, our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method inventory valuation reserve adjustment, which is included in cost of sales and, in effect, reflects cost of sales at current replacement costs, resulted in credits, or income, of $22.0 million and $156.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our LIFO inventory valuation reserve as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $115.6 million and $137.6 million, respectively. Lower metal costs in our inventory as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 resulted in LIFO income in 2020.
Gross Profit
Our gross profit decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 mainly due to decreased tons sold and a lower average selling price per ton sold as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and the end markets we serve that was partially offset by our record gross profit margin in 2020.
The $38.2 million of net inventory provisions in 2020 reduced our gross profit margin 0.4 percentage points in 2020. See “Net Sales” and “Cost of Sales” above for further discussion on product pricing trends and our LIFO inventory valuation reserve adjustments, respectively.
Our gross profit margin in 2020 was a record. Despite lower pricing for most carbon products we sell during 2020, we were able to increase our gross profit margin in 2020 compared to 2019 through the strong execution of our managers in the field, the favorable metals pricing environment in the fourth quarter of 2020, the continuous improvements in our business and our ongoing investments in value-added processing equipment.
Expenses
* Percentage data not meaningful.
Same-store amounts exclude the results of our 2019 acquisition.
Our same-store SG&A expense was lower in 2020 compared to 2019 mainly due to decreases in incentive compensation related to lower profitability levels, lower employee-related expenses due to temporary and permanent workforce reductions in response to lower activity levels due to COVID-19 and decreases in certain warehouse and delivery expenses that were lower due to our lower tons sold that offset the impact of general inflation. Our SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower sales.
We recorded $157.8 million of impairment and restructuring charges in 2020 compared to $1.2 million in 2019, mainly due to closures of certain energy-related businesses (oil and natural gas) and our reduced long-term outlook for certain of our remaining energy-related businesses in 2020. Please refer to Note 7 - “Intangible Assets, net” and Note 19 - “Impairment and Restructuring Charges” of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on our 2020 and 2019 impairment and restructuring charges.
Operating Income
The decrease in our operating income in 2020 compared to 2019 was mainly due to lower gross profit, resulting from significantly lower sales levels partially offset by a record gross profit margin, and impairment and restructuring charges that were partially offset by a lower SG&A expense. The decrease in our operating income margin in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to our lower sales which, despite the significant decrease in our gross SG&A expense, increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales. In addition, impairment and restructuring charges of $157.8 million in 2020 reduced our operating margin 1.8 percentage points. See Note 19 - “Impairment and Restructuring Charges” of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on our 2020 impairment and restructuring charges. See “Net Sales” above for trends in both demand and costs of our products and “Expenses” for trends in our operating expenses.
Other Expense (Income), net
* Percentage data not meaningful.
Interest expense was lower in 2020 due to lower interest rates on decreased borrowing levels on our revolving credit facility and repaid term loan. See Note 9 - “Debt” of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on our issuance of unsecured debt securities, the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, and the interest rates on our borrowings. The change in other expense (income), net in 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to postretirement benefit plan settlement charges of $19.4 million in 2020 that mainly related to the termination of a frozen defined benefit plan.
Income Tax Rate
Our effective income tax rate in 2020 of 22.1% declined from our 2019 rate of 24.0% mainly due to our lower taxable income in 2020. The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% were mainly due to state income taxes partially offset by the effects of company-owned life insurance policies.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer’s share of social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. We expect to receive an insignificant amount of payroll tax credits in 2021 under the CARES Act.
Net Income
The decrease in our net income and net income margin in 2020 compared to 2019 was mainly due to decreased operating income and operating income margin, as discussed above, offset by a lower effective income tax rate.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
See discussion in the “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operations of $1.17 billion in 2020 decreased from $1.30 billion in 2019. The 9.9% decline in our operating cash flow year-over-year generated from the 47.4% decline in net income attributable to Reliance was a
result of our lower net income offset by increases in non-cash impairment of long-lived asset charges and decreased working capital investment (primarily accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable) in 2020. To manage our working capital, we focus on our days sales outstanding and on our inventory turnover rate, as receivables and inventory are the two most significant elements of our working capital. Our average days sales outstanding rate was 41.9 days in 2020 compared to 42.5 days in 2019. We achieved our 2020 inventory turn rate (based on tons) goal of 4.7 times (or 2.6 months on hand), an increase from 4.5 times (or 2.7 months on hand) in 2019.
Income taxes paid were $87.5 million in 2020, a significant decrease from $214.3 million in 2019. The decrease is mainly due to lower estimated taxable income for 2020 compared to 2019 and the utilization of tax overpayments for the 2019 tax year that reduced taxes paid in 2020.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $188.4 million in 2020 decreased significantly from $419.1 million used in 2019, mainly due to $170.9 million less cash used to fund our acquisitions in 2020 compared to 2019 and decreased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $172.0 million in 2020 compared to record capital expenditures of $242.2 million in 2019.
The majority of our 2020 and 2019 capital expenditures related to growth initiatives.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities of $483.0 million in 2020 decreased significantly from $840.6 million used in 2019, mainly due to the proceeds received from our third quarter of 2020 issuance of unsecured debt securities. Net debt borrowings were $58.8 million in 2020 compared to net debt repayments of $617.9 million in 2019. We extended our debt maturity profile through our issuance of $900.0 million of long-term unsecured debt securities with maturities in 2025 and 2030, of which we used $891.7 million of the net proceeds to pay off $640.0 million of outstanding borrowings on our previous credit agreement during 2020. We also continued our shareholder return activities in 2020 with $164.1 million of dividends and $337.3 million of share repurchases compared to $151.3 million of dividends and $50.0 million repurchases in 2019.
We have paid regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders for 61 consecutive years and increased the quarterly dividend on our common stock 28 times since our IPO in 1994, with the most recent increase of 10.0% from $0.625 per share to $0.6875 per share effective in the first quarter of 2021. We increased our dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share in February 2018, to $0.55 per share in February 2019, and to $0.625 in February 2020. We have never reduced or suspended our regular quarterly dividend.
On October 23, 2018, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase plan, increasing the total authorized number of shares available to be repurchased by 5.0 million and extending the duration of the plan through December 31, 2021. In 2020, we repurchased 3,674,004 shares of our common stock at an average cost of $91.80 per share, for a total of $337.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had remaining authorization under the plan to repurchase approximately 2.8 million shares, or about 4% of our current outstanding shares. From the inception of the plan in 1994 through December 31, 2020, we have repurchased approximately 32.8 million shares at an average cost of $48.21 per share. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in our approach to repurchasing shares of our common stock.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated from operations, cash on hand and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. Our total outstanding debt at December 31, 2020 was $1.66 billion, compared to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings, $36.3 million of letters of credit issued and $1.46 billion available for borrowing on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had $683.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and our net debt-to-total capital ratio (net debt-to-total capital is calculated as total debt, net of cash, divided by total Reliance stockholders’ equity plus total debt, net of cash) was 15.8%, down from 21.4% as of December 31, 2019.
On September 3, 2020, we entered into a $1.5 billion unsecured five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) that amended and restated our existing $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2020, borrowings under the Credit Agreement were available at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.25% or the bank prime rate plus 0.25% and we pay a commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.20% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The applicable margins over LIBOR and base rate borrowings, along with commitment fees, are subject to adjustment every quarter based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. All borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid without penalty.
A revolving credit facility with a credit limit of $8.3 million is in place for an operation in Asia with an outstanding balance of $5.4 million and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
We believe our existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and financial commitments, as well as continued stockholder return activities.
Capital Resources
On November 20, 2006, we entered into an indenture (the “2006 Indenture”) for the issuance of $600.0 million of unsecured debt securities. The total issuance was comprised of (a) $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of 6.20% per annum, which matured and were repaid on November 15, 2016 and (b) $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of 6.85% per annum, maturing on November 15, 2036.
On April 12, 2013, we entered into an indenture (the “2013 Indenture”) for the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes at the rate of 4.50% per annum, maturing on April 15, 2023.
On August 3, 2020, we entered into an indenture (the “2020 Indenture” and, together with the 2013 Indenture and 2006 Indenture, the “Indentures”) for the issuance of $900.0 million of unsecured debt securities. The total issuance under the 2020 Indenture was comprised of (a) $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of 1.30% per annum, maturing on August 15, 2025 and (b) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of 2.15% per annum, maturing on August 15, 2030.
Under the Indentures, the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. If we experience a change in control accompanied by a downgrade in our credit rating, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Various industrial revenue bonds had combined outstanding balances of $8.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and $9.0 million as of December 31, 2019, and have maturities through 2027.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $912.6 million of debt obligations coming due before our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expires on September 2, 2025.
We believe that we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future operating needs and to repay our debt obligations as they become due. In addition to funds generated from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility, we expect to continue to be able to access the capital markets to raise funds, if desired. As discussed above under “-Overview,” we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business and preserve our liquidity position. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain our operations, make necessary capital expenditures, finance strategic growth through acquisitions and internal initiatives, pay dividends and opportunistically repurchase shares. Additionally, based on current market conditions, we believe our investment grade credit rating enhances our ability to effectively raise capital, if needed. We expect to continue our acquisition and other growth and stockholder return activities and anticipate that we will be able to fund such activities as they arise.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse effect on our net sales and pretax income. Future decreases in cash flow from operations would decrease the cash available for the capital uses described above, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, repayment of debt, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, since the ultimate severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, we cannot predict the impact it will have on our customers and suppliers and on the debt and equity capital markets, and we cannot estimate the ultimate impact it will have on our liquidity and capital resources.
Covenants
The Credit Agreement and the Indentures include customary representations, warranties, covenants, acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions. The covenants under the Credit Agreement include, among other things, two financial maintenance covenants that require us to comply with a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. Our interest coverage ratio for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 was 11.8 times compared to the debt covenant minimum requirement of 3.0 times (interest coverage ratio is calculated as earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), as defined in the Credit Agreement, divided by interest expense). Our leverage ratio as of December 31, 2020, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, was 22.6% compared to the debt covenant maximum amount of 60% (leverage ratio is calculated as total debt, inclusive of finance lease obligations and outstanding letters of credit, minus the lesser of cash held by our domestic subsidiaries and $200.0 million, divided by Reliance stockholders’ equity plus total debt).
We were in compliance with all financial covenants in our Credit Agreement at December 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit in the aggregate amounts of $27.8 million and $28.4 million, respectively. The letters of credit are related to insurance policies and construction projects.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
(1) Interest is estimated using applicable rates as of December 31, 2020 for our outstanding fixed and variable-rate debt based on their respective scheduled maturities. Also, for purposes of this estimate, no borrowings on the revolving credit facility are assumed for all periods presented, consistent with our borrowings at December 31, 2020.
(2) The majority of our inventory purchases are completed within 30 to 120 days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long-term sales commitments.
(3) Includes the estimated benefit payments for the next ten years for various long-term retirement plans. Since estimating employer funding projections for defined benefit plans beyond one year is not practicable, we have only included the estimated employer contribution amounts for 2021. We have excluded deferred income taxes of $455.6 million and other long-term liabilities of $26.7 million from the amounts presented, as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain.
Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. Therefore, agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long-term sales commitments.
The expected timing of payments to settle the obligations above is estimated based on current information. The ultimate timing and amounts paid may be different, depending on when goods or services are received, pricing in effect at the time inventory purchase commitments are made, or due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
Inflation
Our operations have not been, and we do not expect them to be, materially affected by general inflation. Historically, we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices. However, we are susceptible to changes in metals pricing. For more information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” under the caption “The costs that we pay for metals fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control, and such fluctuations could adversely affect our operating results, particularly if we cannot pass on higher metal prices to our customers.”
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We have one operating segment and also one reporting unit for goodwill impairment purposes. There have been no changes in our reportable segments; we have one reportable segment - metals service centers.
Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, amounted to $1.94 billion at December 31, 2020, or approximately 24% of total assets and 38% of total equity. Additionally, other intangible assets, net amounted to $947.1 million at December 31, 2020, or approximately 12% of total assets and 18% of total equity. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for further information regarding our 2020 and 2018 impairment charges and discussion regarding judgments involved in testing for recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. When we prepare these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments, including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include those related to the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting estimates, as discussed with our Audit Committee, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. (See Note 1 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.") There have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as for revenue recognition, however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We test for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives annually and, between annual tests, whenever significant events or changes occur based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value. The qualitative factors we review include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in the market conditions of our products and viability of end markets, and developments in our business and the overall economy. We make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets, including calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, as necessary. We perform the required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of November 1 of each year. No impairment of goodwill was determined to exist in 2020, 2019 or 2018. We recorded impairment losses on our intangible assets with indefinite lives in the amount of $67.8 and $16.5 million in 2020 and 2018, respectively. No impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives was recognized in 2019. See Note 19 - “Impairment and Restructuring Charges” of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on our impairment charges.
Impairment tests inherently involve judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Additionally, considerable declines in the market conditions for our products from current levels as well as in the price of our common stock could also significantly impact our impairment analysis. An impairment charge, if incurred, could be material.
Long-Lived Assets
We periodically review the recoverability of our other long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets. We must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. We recorded impairment charges on property, plant and equipment of $9.3 million, $1.2 million and $3.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recorded impairment charges of $30.7 and $16.7 million on our intangible assets subject to amortization in 2020 and 2018, respectively. No impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization was recognized in 2019. See Note 19 - “Impairment and Restructuring Charges” of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on our impairment charges.
