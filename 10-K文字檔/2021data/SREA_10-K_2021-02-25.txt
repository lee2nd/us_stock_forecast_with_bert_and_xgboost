ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
In 2018, we set out to simplify Sempra Energy’s business model and sharpen our focus on our mission to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company. Our 2020 operational and financial results reflect our focus on executing this strategy:
▪We completed the sales of our South American businesses
▪We achieved full commercial operations at Cameron LNG JV Phase 1
▪We reached a final investment decision for ECA LNG Phase 1
▪We executed well on our planned capital expenditures
Our South American businesses and certain activities associated with those businesses are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Nominal activities that are not classified as discontinued operations have been subsumed into Parent and other. Our discussions below exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We discuss the following in Results of Operations:
▪Overall results of operations of Sempra Energy Consolidated;
▪Segment results;
▪Significant changes in revenues, costs and earnings; and
▪Impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on our results of operations.
OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SEMPRA ENERGY CONSOLIDATED
In 2020 compared to 2019, our earnings increased by $1,709 million to $3,764 million and our diluted EPS increased by $5.59 to $12.88. In 2019 compared to 2018, our earnings increased by $1,131 million to $2,055 million and our diluted EPS increased by $3.87 to $7.29. The change in diluted EPS for 2020 and 2019 included decreases of $(0.46) and $(0.33), respectively, attributable to an increase in weighted-average common shares outstanding. Our earnings and diluted EPS were impacted by variances discussed in “Segment Results” below.
SEGMENT RESULTS
This section presents earnings (losses) by Sempra Energy segment, as well as Parent and other and discontinued operations, and a related discussion of the changes in segment earnings (losses). Throughout the MD&A, our reference to earnings represents earnings attributable to common shares. Variance amounts presented are the after-tax earnings impact (based on applicable statutory tax rates), unless otherwise noted, and before NCI, where applicable.
(1) Includes intercompany eliminations recorded in consolidation and certain corporate costs.
SDG&E
The increase in earnings of $57 million (7%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$62 million due to the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 related to 2016-2018 forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account, which we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements;
▪$52 million higher electric transmission margin, including an increase in authorized ROE and the following impacts from the March 2020 FERC-approved TO5 settlement:
◦$18 million to conclude a rate base matter, and
◦$9 million favorable impact from the retroactive application of the final TO5 settlement for 2019;
▪$23 million higher AFUDC equity; and
▪$16 million higher income tax benefits from flow-through items; offset by
▪$44 million expected to be refunded to customers and a fine related to the Energy Efficiency Program inquiry, which we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements;
▪$31 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the CPUC directed to be allocated to shareholders in a January 2019 decision;
▪$13 million higher amortization and accretion of the Wildfire Fund asset and liability, respectively; and
▪$12 million higher net interest expense.
The increase in earnings of $98 million (15%) in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:
▪$71 million higher CPUC base operating margin authorized for 2019, net of operating expenses;
▪$31 million income tax benefit from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the CPUC directed to be allocated to shareholders in a January 2019 decision; and
▪$11 million higher margin from electric transmission operations, net of a FERC formulaic rate adjustment benefit in 2018; offset by
▪$10 million amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset.
SoCalGas
The decrease in earnings of $137 million (21%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$233 million from impacts associated with Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility litigation and regulatory matters;
▪$38 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the impact of the January 2019 CPUC decision allocating certain excess deferred income tax balances to shareholders; and
▪$12 million higher net interest expense; offset by
▪$64 million due to the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 related to 2016-2018 income tax expense forecasting differences;
▪$29 million higher CPUC base operating margin authorized for 2020, net of operating expenses;
▪$21 million impairment of non-utility native gas assets in 2019;
▪$10 million higher income tax benefits from flow-through items; and
▪$8 million in penalties in 2019 related to the SoCalGas billing practices OII.
The increase in earnings of $241 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:
▪$216 million higher CPUC base operating margin authorized for 2019, net of operating expenses;
▪$38 million income tax benefit from the impact of the January 2019 CPUC decision allocating certain excess deferred income tax balances to shareholders;
▪$22 million from impacts associated with Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility litigation in 2018; and
▪$14 million higher income tax benefits from flow-through items; offset by
▪$21 million impairment of non-utility native gas assets in 2019;
▪$18 million higher net interest expense; and
▪$8 million penalties in 2019 related to the SoCalGas billing practices OII.
Sempra Texas Utilities
The increase in earnings of $51 million (10%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings driven by:
▪increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth;
▪the impact of Oncor’s acquisition of InfraREIT in May 2019; and
▪higher AFUDC equity; offset by
▪unfavorable weather and increased operating costs and expenses attributable to invested capital.
The increase in earnings of $157 million (42%) in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily represented higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings, which we acquired in March 2018, driven by the impact of Oncor’s acquisition of InfraREIT in May 2019 and higher revenues due to rate updates to reflect increases in invested transmission capital, offset by higher operating costs.
Sempra Mexico
Because Ecogas, our natural gas distribution utility in Mexico, uses the local currency as its functional currency, its revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in Sempra Energy’s results of operations. Prior year amounts used in the variances discussed below are as adjusted for the difference in foreign currency translation rates between years. We discuss these and other foreign currency effects below in “Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations.”
The increase in earnings of $6 million (2%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$69 million favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency derivatives effects, comprised of:
◦in 2020, $51 million favorable foreign currency and inflation effects, offset by a $39 million loss from foreign currency derivatives, and
◦in 2019, $86 million unfavorable foreign currency and inflation effects, offset by a $29 million gain from foreign currency derivatives; and
▪$33 million higher earnings primarily due to the start of commercial operations of the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan marine pipeline at IMG JV in September 2019; offset by
▪$165 million earnings attributable to NCI at IEnova in 2020 compared to $122 million earnings in 2019;
▪$22 million higher net interest expense;
▪$21 million lower earnings at the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline primarily from force majeure payments that ended in August 2019; and
▪$13 million lower earnings at TdM primarily due to scheduled major maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The increase in earnings of $16 million (7%) in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:
▪$18 million primarily due to the start of commercial operations of the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan marine pipeline at IMG JV in the third quarter of 2019;
▪$16 million lower income tax expense in 2019 primarily from a two-year tax abatement that expired in 2020; and
▪$122 million earnings attributable to NCI at IEnova in 2019 compared to $132 million earnings in 2018; offset by
▪$20 million lower earnings primarily from force majeure payments that ended on August 22, 2019 with respect to the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline; and
▪$17 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency derivatives effects, comprised of:
◦in 2019, $88 million unfavorable foreign currency and inflation effects, offset by a $29 million gain from foreign currency derivatives, offset by
◦in 2018, $43 million unfavorable foreign currency and inflation effects, offset by a $1 million gain from foreign currency derivatives.
Sempra LNG
Earnings of $320 million in 2020 compared to losses of $6 million in 2019 were primarily due to:
▪$284 million higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV primarily due to commencement of Phase 1 commercial operations; and
▪$41 million higher earnings from Sempra LNG’s marketing operations primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices.
The decrease in losses of $611 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:
▪$665 million net impairment of certain non-utility natural gas storage assets in the southeast U.S. in 2018, including $801 million impairment in the second quarter of 2018, offset by a $136 million reduction to the impairment in the fourth quarter of 2018;
▪$17 million higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, including:
◦$36 million increase primarily due to Train 1 commencing commercial operation under its tolling agreements in August 2019, offset by
◦$19 million decrease due to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and associated fees related to Cameron LNG JV’s debt refinancing; and
▪$9 million unfavorable adjustment in 2018 to TCJA provisional amounts recorded in 2017 related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes; offset by
▪$36 million losses attributable to NCI in 2018 related to the net impairment discussed above; and
▪$28 million higher liquefaction project development costs and operating costs.
Sempra Renewables
As we discuss in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Sempra Renewables sold its remaining wind assets and investments in April 2019, upon which date the segment ceased to exist.
The decrease in earnings of $269 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:
▪$367 million gain on the sale of all Sempra Renewables’ operating solar assets, solar and battery storage development projects and its 50% interest in a wind power generation facility in December 2018; and
▪$92 million lower earnings from assets sold in December 2018 and April 2019, net of lower general and administrative and other costs due to the wind-down of this business; offset by
▪$145 million other-than-temporary impairment of certain U.S. wind equity method investments in 2018; and
▪$45 million gain on sale of Sempra Renewables’ remaining wind assets in 2019.
Parent and Other
The increase in losses of $47 million (9%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$100 million equity losses from our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities to settle pending tax matters and related legal costs, which we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements;
▪$26 million higher preferred dividends due to the issuance of series C preferred stock in June 2020;
▪$9 million lower net investment gains on dedicated assets in support of our employee nonqualified benefit plan and deferred compensation obligations, net of deferred compensation expenses; offset by
▪$36 million lower net interest expense;

Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations that were previously in our Sempra South American Utilities segment include our former 100% interest in Chilquinta Energía in Chile, our former 83.6% interest in Luz del Sur in Peru and our former interests in two energy-services companies, Tecnored and Tecsur, which provide electric construction and infrastructure services to Chilquinta Energía and Luz del Sur, respectively, as well as third parties. Discontinued operations also include activities, mainly income taxes related to the South American businesses, that were previously included in the holding company of the South American businesses at Parent and other.
As we discuss in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the sales of our South American businesses in the second quarter of 2020. In April 2020, we sold our equity interests in our Peruvian businesses, including our 83.6% interest in Luz del Sur and our interest in Tecsur, for cash proceeds of $3,549 million, net of transaction costs and as adjusted for post-closing adjustments, and in June 2020, we sold our equity interests in our Chilean businesses, including our 100% interest in Chilquinta Energía and Tecnored and our 50% interest in Eletrans, for cash proceeds of $2,216 million, net of transaction costs and as adjusted for post-closing adjustments.
The increase in earnings from our discontinued operations of $1,512 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
▪$1,499 million after-tax gain on the sale of our Peruvian businesses;
▪$248 million after-tax gain on the sale of our Chilean businesses; and
▪$7 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to $51 million income tax expense in 2019 related to changes in outside basis differences from earnings and foreign currency effects since the January 25, 2019 approval of our plan to sell our South American businesses; offset by
▪$201 million lower operational earnings mainly as a result of the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses; and
▪$89 million income tax benefit in 2019 related to outside basis differences existing as of January 25, 2019.
The increase in earnings of $172 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:
▪$91 million higher earnings from South American operations mainly from higher rates, lower cost of purchased power at Peru, and including $38 million lower depreciation expense due to assets classified as held for sale;
▪$89 million income tax benefit in 2019 from outside basis differences in our South American businesses primarily related to the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion from our decision on January 25, 2019 to hold those businesses for sale and a change in the anticipated structure of the sale; and
▪$44 million income tax expense in 2018 to adjust TCJA provisional amounts recorded in 2017 primarily related to withholding tax on our expected future repatriation of foreign undistributed earnings; offset by
▪$51 million income tax expense related to the increase in outside basis differences from 2019 earnings since January 25, 2019.
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REVENUES, COSTS AND EARNINGS
This section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the Consolidated Statements of Operations for Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas.
Utilities Revenues and Cost of Sales
Our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at our California Utilities and Sempra Mexico’s Ecogas and electric revenues at SDG&E. Intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in the Sempra Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations.
SoCalGas and SDG&E currently operate under a regulatory framework that permits:
▪The cost of natural gas purchased for core customers (primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers) to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred. However, SoCalGas’ GCIM provides SoCalGas the opportunity to share in the savings and/or costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly market-based benchmarks. This mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price. Any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between the core customers and SoCalGas.
▪SDG&E to recover the actual cost incurred to generate or procure electricity based on annual estimates of the cost of electricity supplied to customers. The differences in cost between estimates and actual are recovered or refunded in subsequent periods through rates.
▪The California Utilities to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the CPUC, or “refundable programs.”
Because changes in SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s cost of natural gas and/or electricity are recovered in rates, changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings. In addition to the changes in cost or market prices, natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by customer billing cycles causing a difference between customer billings and recorded or authorized costs. These differences are required to be balanced over time, resulting in over- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts.
The table below summarizes utilities revenues and cost of sales.
(1) Excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately on the Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Natural Gas Revenues and Cost of Natural Gas
The table below summarizes the average cost of natural gas sold by the California Utilities and included in Cost of Natural Gas on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The average cost of natural gas sold at each utility is impacted by market prices, as well as transportation, tariff and other charges.
In 2020 compared to 2019, our natural gas revenues increased by $226 million (4%) to $5.4 billion primarily due to:
