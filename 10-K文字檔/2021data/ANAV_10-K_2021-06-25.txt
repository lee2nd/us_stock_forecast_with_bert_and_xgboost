GOING CONCERN
Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. is a development stage company and currently has limited operations. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Alpha Network Alliance Ventures which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our cash balance at December 31, 2019 was $48 with $3,612,352 in outstanding liabilities. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are expected to be approximately $45,000,000, in order to complete our 12-month plan of operation, more fully described below in the section titled, “Plan of Operation.” If we experience a shortage of funds prior to generating revenues from operations we may utilize funds from our director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating costs, however they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us. Management believes our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months.
PLAN OF OPERATION
Our plan of operation over the next 12-month period is as follows, assuming we offer and sell the amount of securities in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-224132), declared effective by the SEC on June 25, 2018:
We currently do not have any agreements or arrangements regarding financing our plan of operation, and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further financing, the successful development of our planned business consulting services, a successful marketing and promotion program, and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.
