In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.

Business Overview
SurgePays, incorporated in Nevada on August 18, 2006, is a technology-driven company building a next generation supply chain software platform that offers wholesale goods and services in a cost-efficient manner as an alternative to traditional wholesale supply chain distribution models. We offer goods and services direct to convenience stores, bodegas, minimarts, tiendas and other corner stores, providing goods and services primarily to the underbanked community. Our products are currently distributed nationwide using our direct to store distribution (“DSD”) system that reaches more than 8,000 outlets. We market our products using a range of marketing mediums, including in-store merchandising and promotions, experiential marketing, sales spiffs and incentives, digital marketing and social media, and internal regional salespeople.
SurgePays Blockchain Software
SurgePays Blockchain Software is a multi-purpose e-commerce platform offering wholesale goods and services direct to convenience stores, bodegas, minimarts, tiendas and other corner stores providing goods and services primarily to the underbanked community. SurgePays leverages Direct Store Delivery (DSD) and the cost saving efficiencies of e-commerce to provide our customers as many commonly-sold consumable products as possible with a focus on increasing profit margins. These products include herbal stimulants, energy shots, dry foods, CBD products, communication accessories, novelties, PPP products, bagged snacks and food items, automotive parts and many more goods, all through one convenient wholesale e-commerce platform.
Surge Marketplace Software
Surge Marketplace Software allows the merchant to use the portal interface, which is similar to a website, with image driven navigation to add wireless minutes to any prepaid wireless carrier’s phone and access to other services such as bill payment and loading debit cards. We believe what makes SurgePays unique in that it also offers the merchant the ability to order wholesale consumable goods at a discount through the portal with one touch ease. SurgePays is essentially a wholesale e-commerce storefront that offers products direct from manufactures. The goal of the SurgePays Portal is to leverage the competitive advantage and efficiencies of direct e-commerce to provide as many commonly-sold consumable products as possible to convenience stores, all through one convenient wholesale e-commerce platform.
Electronic Check Services (ECS)
ECS has been a financial technology tech and wireless top-up platform for over 15 years. On October 1, 2019, we acquired ECS primarily for the favorable ACH banking relationship; a fintech transactions platform processing over 20,000 transactions a day at approximately 8,000 independently owned retail stores. The goal was to incorporate our blockchain components into the existing EGS network. After a year of development and integration, we believe the ECS platform has been successfully merged into our platform with secure ledger data backups and will continue to serve as the proven backbone for wireless top-up transactions and wireless product aggregation.
LocoRabbit Wireless
LocoRabbit Wireless offers prepaid wireless plans with talk, text, and 4G LTE data at prices that are lower than direct competitors. Available nationwide, LocoRabbit Wireless is sold online direct to consumers and by a nationwide network of convenience stores, gas stations, mini-marts, bodegas and tiendas connected to the SurgePays software platform. Due to our wireless payment platform, SurgePays is able to exclusively offer an industry high commission to the retailer for top-ups paid monthly at the client’s store.
True Wireless
True Wireless is licensed through the FCC to provide Lifeline Service (subsidized wireless service to qualifying low-income customers) in five (5) states. Utilizing the T-Mobile backbone, True Wireless provides discounted and free wireless service to veterans and other disadvantaged customers who qualify for certain federal programs such as SNAP (EBT) and Medicaid.
Surge Logics
Surge Logics, Inc. is wholly owned subsidiary that operates as a performance-driven marketing firm focused on the mass tort industry for attorneys and law firms. We primarily perform client acquisition and retention services for attorneys and law firms by operating highly-scalable digital marketing campaigns, called performance campaigns, using our proprietary technology and data-driven analytics. These performance campaigns, and the related follow-up by our experienced in-house team, enable our attorney and law firm advertising clients to more effectively and economically connect with potential clients they are seeking to represent in existing or planned litigation. Our proven strategy of delivering cost-effective lead acquisitions and retained cases to our attorney and law firm clients means those clients are better able to manage their media and advertising budgets and reach targeted audiences more quickly and effectively.
Our customized performance campaign offers are targeted at clients interested in completing signed retainers. The first step is to understand the specific criteria of our client. After this, we proceed to generate consumer traffic to our digital media platforms or our clients’ media platforms. Although there is no assurance of generating revenue from this move, we go all the way, bearing all the costs and risks involved. When we use our resources in acquiring consumer traffic, we want to help our clients amass cost-effective retained cases effectively. This, in turn, guarantees maximum profit margins for them.
Centercom

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our current assets were $1,251,029 and $3,574,885, respectively, and our current liabilities were $15,306,509 and $7,054,124, respectively, which resulted in a working capital deficit of $14,055,480 and $3,479,239, respectively. The decrease in current assets is a result of recognizing bad debt expense to write off uncollectible accounts receivable. The increase in current liabilities is the result of incurring additional debt in 2020 with payment terms less than one-year.
Total assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $7,325,071 and $9,986,373, respectively. The decrease in total assets is a result of recognizing bad debt expense to write off uncollectible accounts receivable. At December 31, 2020, assets consisted of current assets of $1,251,029, net property and equipment of $236,810, net intangible assets of $4,125,742, goodwill of $866,782, equity investment in Centercom of $414,612, and operating lease right of use asset of $368,638, as compared to current assets of $3,574,885, net property and equipment of $294,616, net intangible assets of $4,769,117, goodwill of $866,782, equity investment in Centercom of $203,700 and operating lease right of use asset of $210,816 at December 31, 2019. The operating lease right of use increased related to a new lease acquired in the ECS assets purchase agreement.
At December 31, 2020, our total liabilities of $18,051,037 increased $3,365,049 from $14,685,988 at December 31, 2019. The Company entered into several promissory notes during 2020, creating additional debt in 2020 over 2019.
At December 31, 2020, our total stockholders’ deficit was $10,725,966 as compared to $4,699,615 at December 31, 2019. The principal reason for the increase in stockholders’ deficit was the impact of the net loss of $10,721,626 offset by equity issuances during 2020.
We believe we will continue to incur net losses and do not expect positive cash flows from operations until the 4th quarter of 2021. At that time, we believe the impact of COVID-19 will have rescinded enough to allow us to fully implement our sales strategy, resulting in increased revenue in all segments of our business.
The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
As a result of increased financing activities in 2020, the cash increased in 2020 by $327,955.
