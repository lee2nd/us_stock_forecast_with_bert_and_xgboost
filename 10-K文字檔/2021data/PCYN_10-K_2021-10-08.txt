Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company’s actual plan of operations, business strategy, operating results and financial position could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements.
Our business in general is subject to certain risks including but not limited to the following:
-
we may not be able to produce or obtain, or may have to obtain at excessive prices, the raw materials and finished goods we need;
-
the vendors on whom we rely for manufacturing certain products may go out of business, fail to meet demand or provide shipments on an untimely basis;
-
competitive pressures may require us to lower our prices on certain products, thereby adversely affecting operational results;
-
we may not be able to obtain, or obtain at uneconomic expense and protracted time, the regulatory approval of new products;
-
no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product. We must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of our products, and criminal prosecution;
-
consumers or distributors may not favorably receive our new or existing products;
-
we may not be able to obtain adequate financing to fund our operations or expansion;
-
a relatively small group of products may represent a significant portion of our net revenues or net earnings from time to time; if the volume or pricing of any of these products declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations;
-
we could experience reduced revenues and profits if Medicare or other government programs change, delay or deny reimbursement claims;
-
we are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices; violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs; violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, and financial condition;
-
the loss of senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract and retain additional senior management or other key personnel, could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan;
-
we could become subject to new unanticipated governmental regulations or fail to comply with regulations applicable to our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations; and
-
legislative or regulatory programs that may influence prices of medical devices could have a material adverse effect on our business;
-
the demand for our products may decrease because of various factors, such as adverse business conditions and a sluggish U.S. economy;
-
our product supply and related patient access to products could be negatively impacted by, among other things: (i) seizure or recalls of products or forced closings of manufacturing plants, (ii) supply chain continuity including from natural or man-made disasters at one of our facilities or at a critical supplier or vendor, as well as our failure or the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing, (iii) manufacturing, quality assurance/quality control, supply problems or governmental approval delays, (iv) the failure of a sole source or single source supplier to provide us with necessary raw materials, supplies or finished goods for an extended period of time, (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with finished product on time, (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays related to new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities (vii) the failure to meet new and emerging regulations requiring products to be tracked throughout the distribution channels using unique identifiers and (viii) other manufacturing or distribution issues including limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements; changes in the types of products produced; physical limitations or other business interruptions;
-
we may experience an increase in the number and magnitude of delinquent or uncollectible customer accounts during periods of economic downturn.
-
The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The outbreak of COVID-19 is believed to have originated in December 2019 and has since spread to multiple countries around the world, including the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have ordered non-essential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home. This has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity, a related increase in unemployment and a significant decline in the value of the stock market and many non-essential and elective medical procedures to be delayed or canceled. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including by causing disruptions in the supply for our products. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our operations due to users of our products delaying or canceling medical treatments and the closure of doctors offices and other medical health facilities which administer our products. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, financing or on healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our results from operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. A summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. The estimates used by management are based upon our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of its operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts, based upon exacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company accounts for income taxes under Topic 740 - Income Tax in the Accounting Standards Codification. A valuation allowance is used to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods. The estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require us to exercise complex judgments. We periodically review and adjust those estimates based upon the most current information available. We had a valuation allowance of $144,619 as of June 30, 2020. We had no valuation allowance as of June 30, 2021.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13, “Revenue Recognition”, which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and, (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue related to product sales upon the shipment of such orders to customers.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard became effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. There has been no material effect to our financial results of operations based on this new standard.
Stock Based Compensation
Stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with Topic 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation in the Accounting Standards Codification. All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be recognized in the statement of operations based upon their fair values and rescinds the acceptance of pro forma disclosure.
General
Our continuing operations and revenues consist of the operations of and revenues generated by AMERX, our wholly-owned subsidiary. AMERX skin and wound care products, marketed under the trademark AMERIGEL® and containing the proprietary ingredient OAKIN®, promote wound healing and healthy skin through moderately priced products for treatment of problematic skin and wound conditions.
AMERX markets AMERIGEL®, HELIX3®, AMERX® wound care products and EXTREMIT-EASE® compression garments to institutional customers such as hospitals, wound care clinics, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and to physicians and other health care practitioners. AMERIGEL® and EXTREMIT-EASE® products are also marketed to retail customers through direct sales, internet sales and through independent and retail chain drug stores and to physicians and other health care practitioners.
AMERX’s products are distributed to institutions and to retail stores through national, regional and local distributors as well as through direct sales and internet sales.
Future Expectations
AMERX expects to further penetrate the health care market through its participation in industry trade shows, advertisements in trade journals, development of additional distributor relationships and by opening new geographical territories (including international markets). These efforts have been limited due to availability secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions enforced on its behalf. AMERX management is trying new methods of Marketing to support its multiple product lines. AMERX management seeks to develop new markets as the AMERIGEL®, HELIX3®, AMERX® and EXTREMIT-EASE® product lines gain broader acceptance. AMERX management also seeks to develop new products to be released as soon as practicable, with expansion of the HELIX3® line expected in fiscal 2022.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
The financial effects of COVID-19 started showing their impact on our Company in March of 2020. Due to the timing of these events, the full effect of COVID-19 on our business cannot yet be fully quantified. We have felt the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in our operations, as management continues to dedicate time and effort researching, discussing and implementing policies and procedures necessary to navigate through the ever changing landscape the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to provide. As an essential business, management was tasked with remaining open, while keeping our employees safe, and providing our customers, who were still able to actively provide healthcare services, with the products they need.
The effects were most severely seen in April 2020. This was a direct result of the inability for customers to have elective surgery. Once elective surgeries were permitted again we have seen a steady increase in volume. We continue to monitor operations, and are still implementing procedures to keep all our employees as safe as possible. Currently, the Company is restricted in its marketing efforts as Tradeshows for the most part are not available in their traditional in person form. Most available tradeshows have chosen the virtual route, which has not proven successful from a vendor sales relationship perspective. Operationally, the pandemic has made it increasingly difficult to hire new or replacement personnel to support the Company’s growth. It has also caused wages to increase dramatically.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Fiscal 2021 and 2020.
During fiscal 2021 and 2020, our results of operations related solely to the operations of AMERX. Net sales during fiscal 2021 were approximately $4,720,000 as compared to approximately $4,334,000 in fiscal 2020, an increase of approximately $386,000 or 9%. Sales grew through continued sales of core brands combined with growth in new product brand sales.
Cost of sales were approximately $1,331,000 in fiscal 2021, as compared to approximately $1,135,000 in fiscal 2020, an increase of approximately $196,000 or 17%. Cost of sales in fiscal 2021, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 28%, from 26% in the previous fiscal year ending 2020.
Gross profit increased to approximately $3,389,000 during fiscal 2021, as compared to approximately $3,199,000 during fiscal 2020, an increase of about $189,000, or 6%. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was approximately 72% in fiscal 2021 as compared to 74% in fiscal 2020.
Operating expenses during fiscal 2021 were approximately $3,064,000, consisting of approximately $1,734,000 in salaries and benefits and $1,330,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses in fiscal 2020 were approximately $3,046,000 and consisted of approximately $1,730,000 in salaries and benefits and approximately $1,317,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses. This represents an increase in expenses of approximately $18,000 in fiscal 2021 over the operating expenses in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses during fiscal 2021 were 65% as compared to 70% during fiscal 2020; as gross profit increased approximately $189,000 for the year on an approximately $18,000 increase in operating expenses. Salaries and Benefits increased slightly. Selling, General and Administrative expenses increased primarily due to shipping expense increases from increased sales.
Income from operations finished at approximately $325,000 in 2021, as compared to approximately $153,000 in fiscal 2020. Income before income taxes finished at approximately $832,000 in 2021, as compared to income of approximately $160,000 in 2020. Net income (after dividend requirements for Preferred Shares) was approximately $751,000 during fiscal 2021, compared to approximately $95,000 of net income during fiscal 2020. The Company recorded approximately $64,000 of income tax expense when determining the net income available to common shares in fiscal 2021, compared to $48,000 in fiscal 2020.
Management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of approximately $446,000 of NOL carryforwards will be realized. Therefore, management did not provided valuation allowance. Management will continue to evaluate its operating results each reporting period and assess whether it will be able to utilize all available NOL carryforwards before expiration.
