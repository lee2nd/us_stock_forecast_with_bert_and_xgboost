Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report, which are incorporated by reference herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion includes forward-looking information that involves risks and assumptions based upon management’s current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from the results referred to in any forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this report.
Correction of Immaterial Errors - During the preparation of the September 30, 2020 condensed consolidated financial statements, certain historical errors were identified relating to the accounting for capital leases under ASC Topics 840 and 842. The lease obligations under certain leases were not recorded at their present values at the inception of the leases; in addition, the asset buyout prices were not reassessed in December 2019 by the Company, both of which resulted in an understatement of expenses from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2019 and an overstatement of expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
The errors were not material, either quantitatively or qualitatively, in any of the reported periods. However, the corrections, if recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 would have been material to such period. Accordingly, the prior period financial statements were corrected by revising such consolidated financial statements for comparability. For the December 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the corrections are as follows:
· An increase in net loss of $540,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
· An increase in expenses of $540,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
· An increase in the loss per share of $0.02 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
· An increase in liabilities of $528,000 as of December 31, 2019.
· A decrease in retained earnings of $777,000 and $237,000 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
· A decrease in total assets of $249,000 as of December 31, 2019.
· The impact on cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 was:
· A decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities of $573,000.
· A decrease in net cash flows used in investing activities of $102,000.
· A decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities of $471,000.
Executive Overview
We are a global data engineering company. We operate in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility.
The following table sets forth certain financial data for the two years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Results of Operations
All percentages have been calculated using rounded amounts.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenues
Total revenues were $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.3 million or 4% from total revenues of $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Revenues from the DDS segment were $42.0 million and $41.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $0.7 million or approximately 2%. The increase was due to higher volume from one client, partially offset by lower volume from two clients of the DDS segment.
Revenues from the Synodex segment were $4.8 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $0.9 million or approximately 23%. The increase was primarily due to higher volume from three clients, partially offset by lower volume from two clients.
Revenues from the Agility segment were $11.4 million and $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $ 0.7 million or approximately 7%. The increase was attributable to higher revenues from subscriptions to our Agility media database.
One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 14% and 16% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Another client in the DDS segment generated 10% of the Company’s total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 54% and 55% of the Company's revenues respectively.
Direct Operating Costs
Direct operating costs consist of direct payroll, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, travel, telecommunications, computer services and supplies, realized gain (loss) on forward contracts, foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our clients.
Direct operating costs were $38.4 million and $37.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1.1 million or approximately 3%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor related costs of $2.1 million, and technology-related expenditures in connection with our BCP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic of $1.1 million. The increase was offset in part by reductions in occupancy and related costs of $1.1 million, content acquisition costs of $0.2 million, and a decrease of $0.8 million due to reversal of a one-time charge of $0.4 million made in the second quarter of 2019 for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions that was successfully adjudicated. Direct operating costs as percentage of total revenues were 66% and 67% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Direct operating costs for the DDS segment were $28.5 million and $27.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1.0 million or approximately 4%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor related costs of $1.8 million, and technology-related expenditures in connection with our BCP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic of $1.1 million. The increase was offset in part by reductions in occupancy and related costs of $1.0 million and a decrease of $0.8 million due to reversal of a one-time charge of $0.4 million made in the second quarter of 2019 for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions that was successfully adjudicated. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues were 68% and 67% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment were approximately $3.4 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $0.2 million or 6%. The increase was principally due to labor related costs associated with the increase in volume. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment as a percentage of segment revenues were 71% and 82% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in Direct operating costs as a percentage of segment revenues during the year was primarily due to higher revenue.
Direct operating costs for the Agility segment were approximately $6.5 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million or 2%. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in content acquisition costs. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 57% and 62% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in Direct operating costs as a percentage of segment revenues during the year was primarily due to higher revenue from subscriptions to our Agility intelligent data platform and newswire products.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses consist of management and administrative salaries, sales and marketing costs including commissions, new services research and related software development, third-party software, advertising and trade conferences, professional fees and consultant costs, and other administrative overhead costs.
Selling and administrative expenses were $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.8 million or 4%. This decrease was primarily due to lower marketing, travel and occupancy expenses of $0.3 million and professional fees of $0.5 million. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 32% and 35% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as percentage of revenues during the year was primarily due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative costs.
Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment were $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.7 million or 5%. This decrease was primarily due to lower marketing, travel and occupancy expenses of $0.2 million and professional fees of $0.5 million. As a percentage of DDS revenues, DDS selling and administrative expenses were 30% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses.
Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $0.2 million or 29%. This increase was primarily due to labor related expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were 19% and 18% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment were $5.4 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million or 5%. This decrease was primarily due to labor related expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 47% and 53% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses.
Goodwill Impairment
On March 31, 2020, we determined that adverse changes in macroeconomic trends as a consequence of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic constituted a triggering event under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” and ASC No. 360, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”). We completed our impairment analysis procedures as of March 31, 2020. We determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets in any of the reporting units as of March 31, 2020.
On September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment in accordance with the provisions of the FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)”, by using a single step approach that evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and comparing it against the reporting unit’s fair value. Our conclusion was consistent with the results of the March 31, 2020 impairment test.
Income Taxes
We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Tax-related charges primarily consisted of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries. Effective income tax rates are disproportionate primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded on the deferred taxes on the U.S. and Canadian entities. See Note 4, “Income Taxes” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized in the table below:
Despite access to overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings and profits in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted foreign earnings and profits amounted to approximately $47.0 million at December 31, 2020. If such foreign earnings and profits are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances.
We have a valuation allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we also have a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Canadian subsidiaries. Our Canadian subsidiaries also have research and development credits available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes.
Tax Assessments
In September 2015, our Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. We disagree with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. We are vigorously contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by our Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $64.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case.
In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, our Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. We disagree with the basis of this decision and are contesting it vigorously. We expect delays in our Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently have service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case.
Net Income (Loss)
We had a net income of $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $2.7 million improvement was attributable to higher revenues of $2.3 million, and a decrease in tax provision of $0.7 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $0.3 million.
Net income for the DDS segment was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.8 million improvement was attributable to higher revenues of $0.7 million and a decrease in tax provisions of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $0.3 million.
Net income for the Synodex segment was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.5 million increase was primarily attributable to the higher revenues of $0.9 million offset in part by higher operating expenses of $0.4 million.
Net loss for the Agility segment was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1.4 million improvement was the result of higher revenues of $0.7 million, reductions in operating expenses of $0.4 million and a tax benefit of $0.3 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources, expressed in thousands, are as follows:
On December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $17.6 million, of which $10.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $7.4 million was held in the United States. Despite the passage of the new tax law under which we may repatriate funds from overseas after paying the toll charge, it is our intent, as of December 31, 2020, to permanently reinvest the overseas funds in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the withholding tax that we would have to incur on the actual remittances.
We have used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) investments in the Agility segment; (ii) the expansion of our other operations; (iii) technology innovation; (iv) product management and strategic marketing; (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital; and (vi) possible business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of approximately $13.5 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $8.3 million as of December 31, 2019.
On May 4, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $579,700 under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable, as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The unforgiven portion of the loan is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1% per year, with a deferral of payments until the date that the Small Business Administration remits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender. On January 29, 2021, we filed our loan forgiveness application for 100% of the approved loan under the PPP.
Proceeds from stock option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.6 million.
We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2020.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. However, as we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or otherwise could materially and adversely affect the Company.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.7 million and was the result of the net income of $0.6 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $3.4 million and sources of working capital of $1.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.3 million for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation of $0.9 million and $0.2 million for other non-cash items. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $1.4 million increase in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, a $0.8 million increase in income and other taxes, offset by a $0.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details.
Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $4.3 million and was the result of the net loss of $2.1 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $3.6 million and sources of working capital of $2.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.7 million for depreciation and amortization, stock option expense of $0.8 million and $0.1 million for other non-cash items. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $1.2 million decrease in our accounts receivable, a $1.2 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets, and a $0.9 million increase in income and other taxes which was offset in part by a use of $0.5 million due to an increase in other working capital. The reduction in accounts receivable is a result of higher collections during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details.
Our days’ sales outstanding were 62 days and 66 days December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We calculate DSO by first dividing the total revenues for the period by average net accounts receivable, which is the sum of net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and net accounts receivable at the end of the period, to yield an amount we refer to as the “accounts receivable turnover”. Then we divide the total number of days within the period reported by the accounts receivable turnover to yield DSO expressed in number of days.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in our investing activities was $1.4 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for internally developed software. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounting to $1.4 million consisted of $0.6 million for the DDS segment and $0.8 million for the Agility segment.
For the year 2020, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment and infrastructure upgrades will approximate $2.0 to $2.3 million, a portion of which we may finance.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was from PPP loan proceeds of $0.6 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.6 million. Payments of long-term obligations were $0.9 million and $0.6 million for December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used in financing activities for 2019 was $1.8 million for the repurchase of 1,503,095 shares of our common stock at a volume-weighted average price of $1.23 per share.
Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic Conditions
Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Thus, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations.
The Philippines and India have at times experienced high rates of inflation as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount of our hedges against the Indian rupee was approximately $2.9 million, and $4.0 million for the Philippine peso.
Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets.
Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in Asia. We are exposed to high inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate. We generally perform work for our clients under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our clients.
Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins.
Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies.
