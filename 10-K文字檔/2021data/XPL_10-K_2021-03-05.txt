Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Our financial condition and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of what may be expected in future years.
(a). Effects of COVID-19
As of December 31, 2020, the effects of COVID-19 have not had a material adverse effect on Solitario’s administrative activities as we have only three full-time employees, all of whom can work remotely, and are not required to meet in person on a regular basis. However, our joint-venture partners, Teck at our Lik project and Nexa at our Florida Canyon project, reduced, with our concurrence, the planned exploration activities on these projects for 2020 and are reviewing their 2021 exploration plans on our projects due to several factors. These factors include but are not limited to; (i) our partners’ limited exploration staffing; (ii) the need to put into place safety and operational protocols for COVID-19 and other potential pandemics related to all of their exploration activities; (iii) the ability to reallocate exploration resources to non-site specific tasks, such as data and resource review, and planning for future drilling; and (iv) the ability to modify and or postpone 2021 exploration activities using the interim period to enhance future potential exploration programs. Solitario does not believe these steps by our joint venture partners with regard to 2020 exploration activities or plans for 2021 exploration reflects on the long-term economic potential of either its Lik or Florida Canyon projects.
Because of the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, and the resulting market volatility and unknown long-term effects of COVID-19, Solitario has taken steps to reduce the potential impact of COVID-19 on its liquidity and capital resources by; (i) obtaining the PPP Loan (defined below); (ii) initiating salary reductions for all of its employees; (iii) reducing its contractual amounts owed to contractors; (iv) reducing non-core activities such as travel and investor relations; and (v) reducing or delaying certain capital costs such as equipment replacement. Although the impact of COVID-19 on Solitario’s ability to access capital markets is unknown and may be reduced, Solitario believes the proceeds of the PPP Loan combined with Solitario’s current assets, provide Solitario with the flexibility to continue its on-going operations.
Nonetheless, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, including our exploration and other activities and the market for our securities, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time. Please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” contained in this Form 10-K.
(b). Business Overview and Summary
We are an exploration stage company at December 31, 2020 under Industry Guide 7, as issued by the SEC. We were incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown. In July 1994, we became a publicly traded company on the TSX through our initial public offering. We have been actively involved in mineral exploration since 1993. Our primary focus is the acquisition and exploration of zinc-related exploration mineral properties. However, we evaluate other mineral properties for acquisition, and we have historically held a portfolio of mineral exploration properties and assets for future sale, for joint venture or to create a royalty up to the development stage of the project (development activities include, among other things, completion of a feasibility study for the identification of proven and probable reserves, as well as permitting and preparing a deposit for mining). At that point, or sometime prior to that point, we would likely attempt to sell a given mineral property, pursue its development either on our own or through a joint venture with a partner that has expertise in mining operations, or obtain a royalty from a third party that continues to advance the property. Although our mineral properties may be developed in the future by us, through a joint venture or by a third party, we have never developed a mineral property. In addition to focusing on its mineral exploration properties and the evaluation of mineral properties for acquisition, Solitario also evaluates potential strategic corporate transactions as a means to acquire an interest in new precious and base metal properties and assets with exploration potential as well as other potential corporate transactions and combinations determined to be favorable to Solitario.
Our geographic focus for the evaluation of potential mineral property assets is in North and South America; however, we have conducted property evaluations for potential acquisition in other parts of the world. At December 31, 2020, we consider our carried interest in our Florida Canyon project in Peru and our interest in the Lik project in Alaska to be our core mineral property assets. We are conducting independent exploration activities in Peru and through joint ventures operated by our partners in Peru and the United States. We conduct potential acquisition evaluations in other countries of both South and North America.
As of December 31, 2020, we have balances of cash and short-term investments that we anticipate using, in part, to fund planned 2021 exploration, to further the exploration of our Lik project, conduct reconnaissance exploration and to potentially acquire additional mineral property assets. The fluctuations in commodity prices of base and precious metals have contributed to a challenging environment for mineral exploration and development, which has created opportunities as well as challenges for the potential acquisition of advanced mineral exploration projects or other related assets at potentially attractive terms.
In analyzing our activities, the most significant aspect relates to results of our exploration and potential development activities and those of our joint venture partners on a property-by-property basis. When our exploration or potential development activities, including drilling, sampling and geologic testing, indicate a project may not be economic or contain sufficient geologic or economic potential we may impair or completely write-off the property. Another significant factor in the success or failure of our activities is the price of commodities. For example, when the price of zinc is down, the value of zinc-bearing mineral properties decreases; however, when the price of zinc is up it may become more difficult and expensive to locate and acquire new zinc-bearing mineral properties with potential to have economic deposits.
The potential sale, joint venture or development of our mineral properties will occur, if at all, on an infrequent basis. Historically, we have recorded revenues and met our need for capital in the past through (i) the sale of properties and assets; (ii) joint venture payments, including delay rental payments; (iii) a royalty sale on our former Mt. Hamilton property; (iv) the sale of our shares of Vendetta and Kinross common stock; (v) long-term debt secured by our mineral property; (vi) short-term borrowing; and (vii) issuances of common stock. During 2019 we recorded mineral property income of $408,000 from the Royalty Sale (defined below), discussed below. We did not record any mineral property income during 2020. Our last major property asset sale occurred in 2015, when we recorded a gain on the sale of our interest in Mount Hamilton LLC of $12,309,000. During June 2012, we sold a royalty interest in our Mt. Hamilton project to Sandstorm Gold Ltd. for $10,000,000. Previous to the sale of our interest in Mt. Hamilton LLC, our last significant cash proceeds from a property or asset sale were recorded in 2000 upon the sale of our former Yanacocha property for $6,000,000. Proceeds from the sale or joint venture of properties, although potentially significant when they occur, have not been a consistent annual source of cash and would occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis. We have reduced our exposure to the costs of our exploration activities in the past through the use of joint ventures. Although we anticipate the use of joint venture funding for some of our exploration activities will continue for the foreseeable future, we can provide no assurance that these or other sources of capital will be available in sufficient amounts to meet our needs, if at all.
Royalty sale
On January 22, 2019, we completed the sale of certain royalties (the “Royalty Sale”) to SilverStream for Cdn$600,000. On closing of the Royalty Sale, we received Cdn$250,000 in cash and a convertible note from SilverStream in the principal amount of Cdn$350,000 (the “SilverStream Note”). The SilverStream Note was originally due December 31, 2019, accrued 5% per annum simple interest, payable on a quarterly basis, and was convertible into common shares of SilverStream, at the discretion of SilverStream, by providing us a notice of conversion. In December 2019, Solitario and SilverStream agreed to extend the due date of the SilverStream Note to June 30, 2020, and to increase the interest rate to 8% per annum simple interest. During 2019, we recorded mineral property revenue of $408,000 from the Royalty Sale, consisting of the fair value of the cash received on the date of the sale of $185,000 and the fair value of the SilverStream Note on the date of the sale of $263,000 less the carrying value of the royalties sold of $40,000.
On May 19, 2020, SilverStream completed an initial public offering, including changing its name to Vox Royalty Corp. (“Vox”), and, in accordance with the terms of the SilverStream Note, issued Solitario 137,255 shares of common stock of Vox in full satisfaction of obligations owed under the SilverStream Note. In accordance with the terms of the SilverStream Note, the 137,255 Vox shares were issued at a price of Cdn$2.55 per share, which was at a 15% discount to the initial public offering price of Cdn$3.00 per share. Solitario recorded its initial investment in the Vox common shares at the initial public offering price, or a total of Cdn$412,000 or $294,000. Solitario recorded other income of $44,000 for the gain on the conversion of the SilverStream Note during 2020.
Solitario recorded interest income from the SilverStream Note of $7,000 and $12,000 during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(c). Results of Operations
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019
We had a net loss of $939,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $3,289,000 or $0.06 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. As explained in more detail below, the primary reasons for the decrease in net loss during 2020 compared to 2019 was (i) a decrease in exploration expense to $413,000 during 2020 compared to exploration expense of $1,807,000 during 2019; (ii) a decrease in general and administrative expense to $1,044,000 during 2020 compared to general and administrative expense of $1,368,000 during 2019; (iii) recording other income of $104,000 during 2020, with no comparable amount in 2019; (iv) a realized gain on sale of marketable equity securities of $50,000 during 2020, with no sales of marketable equity securities in 2019; and (v) an unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $360,000 during 2020 compared to an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of $711,000 during 2019. Partially offsetting these factors that contributed to the decrease in our net loss in 2020 were the following (i) no mineral property sales or revenue during 2020 compared to mineral property sale revenue of $408,000 from the Royalty Sale during 2019; (ii) a reduction in interest and dividend income to $127,000 during 2020 compared to interest and dividend income of $252,000 during 2019; (iii) mineral property impairment of $6,000 during 2020, with no similar impairment during 2019; and (iv) a loss on derivative instruments of $92,000 during 2020 compared with a loss of $38,000 during 2019. Each of these items is discussed in greater detail below.
Our primary exploration activities during 2020 were related to evaluating new projects for acquisition and reviewing data related to our Florida Canyon and Lik projects. There was significantly less work by us during 2020, with no drilling and almost no outside contract cost compared to 2019 when Nexa was completing the Florida Canyon drilling program, started in 2018 and completed in 2019. Solitario agreed to pay a total of $1,580,000 toward the Drilling Program. We recorded exploration expense of $1,054,000 related to the Drilling Program during 2019 when Nexa completed the second and third tranches of the Drilling Program. In addition, we incurred other exploration expenses at Florida Canyon of $18,000 during 2019 not related to the Drilling Program. During all of 2020 our exploration expense at Florida Canyon was $22,000. Nexa is evaluating the 2021 exploration program at Florida Canyon, however Solitario is not required to provide any of the exploration funding at Florida Canyon during 2021. Solitario incurred $14,000 of exploration expense at our Lik project in Alaska during 2020 which consisted of limited analysis and planning for drilling during 2021 as part of a 50/50 exploration program managed by Teck. This compares to exploration expense of $199,000 at the Lik project during 2019 when Teck completed extensive re-logging, re-mapping and related field work at Lik resulting in the increased costs during 2019 compared to 2020. We are evaluating, along with Teck, a modest drilling program for 2021. The program, if approved, consists of drilling two or three core holes totaling approximately 1,000 meters. Drill targets under consideration include an area approximately one kilometer north of Lik deposit and also below the Lik deposit to test for stacked mineralized horizons. Solitario would be responsible for 50% of the expenditures. During 2020 we made the decision to abandon our La Promesa project in Peru and had essentially no exploration expenditures at La Promesa during 2020 compared to 2019, where we incurred exploration expense of $92,000. The expenditures at La Promesa in 2019 were related to community agreements and general exploration activities. The remaining exploration expenditures during 2020 and 2019 were reconnaissance work, including the evaluation of potential mineral properties for acquisition. Our 2021 total exploration and development budget, excluding any new projects, in which we may acquire and interest, is approximately $921,000, which reflects the significant reduction in the expenditures at Florida Canyon, La Promesa and reconnaissance exploration, and the anticipated increase in exploration at our Lik project, but does not reflect any costs for the Gold Coin project or any new projects we may acquire during 2021. Our planned exploration activities in 2021 may be modified, as necessary for any drilling programs we may undertake at Gold Coin or projects we may acquire, changes related to any number of factors including COVID-19 adjustments and or delays, potential acquisition of new properties, joint venture funding, commodity prices and changes in the deployment of our capital.
Exploration expense (in thousands) by property consisted of the following:
We believe a discussion of our general and administrative costs should be viewed without the non-cash stock option compensation expense (discussed below). Excluding these costs, general and administrative costs were $729,000 during 2020 compared to $1,025,000 during 2019. We reduced salary and benefits expense to $291,000 during 2020 compared to $427,000 during 2019 as a result of reductions in staff and salaries. In addition, (i) legal and accounting costs decreased to $131,000 during 2020 compared to $185,000 during 2019, primarily due to reduced activity; (ii) travel and investor relation costs decreased to $197,000 during 2020 compared to $271,000 during 2019 as a result of reductions in travel and in-person meetings and presentations and reduced market activities; (iii) we recorded directors and officer insurance expense of $53,000 during 2019 with no comparable cost during 2020; and (iv) other costs related to office, insurance and miscellaneous costs increased to $107,000 during 2020, which included a $17,000 charge to currency fluctuation, compared to $89,000 during 2019. We anticipate general and administrative costs for 2021 will be similar to the costs incurred during 2020; however, this amount may vary significantly during 2021 depending on the outcome of our property evaluations and any strategic transactions we may attempt to execute upon. We have forecast 2021 general and administrative costs to be approximately $747,000, excluding non-cash stock option compensation expense.
We account for our employee stock options under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification No. 718 (“ASC No. 718”). We recognize stock option compensation expense on the date of grant for 25% of the grant date fair value, and subsequently, based upon a straight-line amortization of the grant date fair value of each of our outstanding options. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $315,000 of non-cash stock option expense for the amortization of our outstanding options grant date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in-capital compared to $343,000 of non-cash stock option compensation expense during 2019. The amount was higher during 2019 primarily due to the amortization of options which became fully vested during 2019 and had no grant date fair value amortization during 2020, which was partially offset by 1,325,000 new options granted during 2020 compared to the 150,000 new options granted during 2019. The majority of our remaining stock option compensation during 2020 and 2019 related to the normal vesting of other outstanding options. See Note 12, “Employee Stock Compensation Plans,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to this Form 10-K” for an analysis of the changes in the fair value of our outstanding stock options and the components that are used to determine the fair value.
We recorded an unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $360,000 during 2020 compared to an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of $711,000 during 2019. The gain in 2020 was primarily related to an unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $61,000 due to an increase in the value of our holdings of shares of Vendetta common stock compared to a decrease in the value of our holdings of Vendetta common stock during 2019, which resulted in an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of $857,000 during 2019. In addition, we recorded an unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $259,000 during 2020 compared to an unrealized gain of $150,000 on our holdings of Kinross common stock during 2019. We also recorded an unrealized gain on our holdings of Vox during 2020 of $30,000, with no similar item during 2019 and we recorded an unrealized gain of $10,000 on holdings of TNR Gold Corp during 2020 compared to a loss of $4,000 during 2019.
During 2020 we acquired 137,255 shares of Vox recorded at $294,000 as part of the Royalty Sale in 2019 in exchange for the SilverStream Note and we sold 2,900,000 shares of Vendetta for cash proceeds of $123,000 and a realized gain of $50,000, with no similar item during 2019. In July of 2019, we acquired 3,450,000 common shares of Vendetta as part of the acquisition of certain Vendetta units, each unit consisting of one common share of Vendetta and one warrant to acquire one common share of Vendetta (the “Vendetta Warrants”). The Vendetta common shares associated with the units were recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition of $165,000. See Note 3, “Marketable Equity Securities” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our marketable equity securities. We may sell some of our marketable equity securities from time to time during 2021 for working capital needs; however, we do not expect to sell all of our holdings of marketable equity securities during 2021. Any proceeds we may receive from sales of marketable equity securities during 2021 will be dependent on the quoted market price of the securities sold on the date of sale and may be at prices below the fair value at December 31, 2020. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
We recorded a loss on derivative instruments of $92,000 during 2020 compared to a loss on derivative instruments of $38,000 during 2019. The loss during 2020 was primarily related to certain covered calls we sold against our holdings of Kinross common stock for cash proceeds of $103,000 and repurchases of those calls prior to their expiration of $224,000 for a loss on derivative instruments of $121,000, which was partially offset by a gain on derivative instruments during 2020 of $29,000 related to our Vendetta Warrants. The loss during 2019 was primarily related to a loss of $47,000 on our Vendetta Warrants which was partially offset by a gain of $9,000 on covered calls against our holdings of Kinross common stock during 2019. See Note 8, “Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our derivative instruments. We anticipate we will continue to write calls against our holdings of Kinross common stock in 2021 to provide additional income on a limited portion of shares of Kinross that Solitario may sell in the near term, which is generally defined as less than one year.
We recorded $25,000 of depreciation and amortization during 2020 compared to $25,000 of depreciation and amortization during 2019. The majority of our depreciation relates to depreciation on equipment acquired in 2017 as part of the acquisition at the Lik project. We amortize these assets over a five-year period. We anticipate our 2021 depreciation and amortization expense will be similar to our 2020 depreciation expense.
We recorded interest income of $127,000 during 2020 compared to interest income of $252,000 during 2019. The decrease during 2020 was primarily related to a reduction in the outstanding balances of our investments in United States Treasury securities and Bank Certificates of Deposit, which decreased to $5,798,000 at December 31, 2020 from a balance of $6,829,000 at December 31, 2019. In addition, during 2020 the value of our mark-to-market short term investments in United States Treasury securities, earned less income as a result of declining interest rates. We anticipate our interest income will decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of the use of our short-term investments and our cash balances for ordinary overhead, operational costs, and the exploration, evaluation and or acquisition of mineral properties discussed above. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” below, for further discussion of our cash and cash equivalent balances.
Our other income of $104,000 related to (i) $44,000 of gain on the conversion of the SilverStream Note to Vox shares (discussed above), and (ii) forgiveness of $60,000 from a Paycheck Protection Program loan of $70,000 (the “PPP Loan”), with no similar items during 2019. See Note 9, “Paycheck Protection Program Loan” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the PPP Loan.
We recorded no deferred tax expense or benefit in either 2020 or 2019 as we provide a valuation allowance for the tax benefit arising out of our net operating losses for all periods presented. See Note 7, “Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our income tax valuation allowance, deferred tax assets and our net operating losses for 2020 and 2019. We anticipate we will continue to provide a valuation allowance for these net operating losses until we are in a net tax liability position with regards to those countries where we operate or until it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize those net operating losses in the future.
We regularly perform evaluations of our mineral property assets to assess the recoverability of our investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable utilizing guidelines based upon future net cash flows from the asset as well as our estimates of the geologic potential of early-stage mineral property and its related value for future sale, joint venture or development by us or others. During 2020 we recorded $6,000 of mineral property impairment related to our decision to abandon our La Promesa project in Peru. We did not abandon or impair any of our properties during 2019 and did not record any mineral property impairment during 2019.
(d). Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash
As of December 31, 2020, we had $605,000 in cash. We intend to utilize a portion of this cash and a portion of our short-term investments, discussed below, to fund our ordinary overhead, operational costs, exploration activities and the potential acquisition of mineral properties and other assets over the next several years. We may also use a portion of these assets to repurchase shares of our common stock, pursuant to the terms of a stock buy-back program discussed below.
Short-term Investments
As of December 31, 2020, we have USTS with maturities of 30 days to one year, recorded at their fair value of $3,989,000. Solitario also holds FDIC insured bank certificates of deposit (“CD’s”) with face values between $100,000 and $250,000 and maturities of two months to 17 months, which are recorded at their fair value of $1,809,000 as of December 31, 2020. The USTS and CD’s are recorded at their fair value based upon quoted market prices. Our short-term investments in USTS and CD’s are highly liquid and may be sold in their entirety at any time at their quoted market price and are classified as a current asset. We anticipate we will roll over that portion of our short-term investments not used for operating costs or mineral property acquisitions as they mature during 2021.
Marketable Equity Securities
Our marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which is based upon market quotes of the underlying securities. We owned 100,000 shares of Kinross common stock as of December 31, 2020, which are recorded at their fair value of $734,000. As of December 31, 2020, we own 11,550,000 shares of Vendetta common stock recorded at their fair market value of $544,000 and we own 137,255 shares of Vox common stock recorded at their fair market value of $323,000. In addition, we own other marketable equity securities with a fair value of $19,000 as of December 31, 2020 based upon quoted market prices. Changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities are recorded as gains and losses in the statements of operations.
Working Capital
We had working capital of $7,875,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to working capital of $8,487,000 as of December 31, 2019. Our working capital at December 31, 2020 consists primarily of our cash and cash equivalents, our investment in short-term investments (discussed above) and our marketable equity securities, less our current liabilities of $174,000. As of December 31, 2020, our cash balances along with our short-term investments and marketable equity securities are adequate to fund our expected expenditures over the next year.
The nature of the mineral exploration business requires significant sources of capital to fund exploration, development and operation of mining projects. We expect we will need additional capital if we decide to develop or operate any of our current exploration projects or any projects or assets we may acquire. We anticipate we would finance any such development through the use of our cash reserves, short-term investments, joint ventures, issuance of debt or equity, or the sale of other exploration projects or assets.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
As of December 31, 2020, options to acquire 5,558,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding. There are 4,083,500 options that are vested and exercisable at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our outstanding options include 3,098,000 options that are in the money with a weighted average exercise price of $0.26 per share, which is below the market price of a share of Solitario common stock at December 31, 2020 of $0.56 per share as quoted on the NYSE American exchange. See Note 12, “Employee Stock Compensation Plans” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the activity in our 2013 Plan during 2020 and 2019. We do not anticipate that stock option exercises will be a significant source of cash during 2021.
Share Repurchase Program
On October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized us to purchase up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock. During 2020, our Board of Directors extended the term of the share repurchase program until December 31, 2021. All shares purchased to date have reduced the number of shares of outstanding common stock. The amount and timing of any shares purchased has been and will be determined by our management and the purchases will be effected in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based upon market conditions and other factors, including price, regulatory requirements and capital availability and in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws. Purchases may also be made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares of common stock by the Company, and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. No purchases have been or will be made outside of the United States, including on the TSX. Payments for shares of common stock repurchased under the program are being funded using the Company’s working capital. As of December 31, 2020, since the inception of the share repurchase program, we have purchased a total of 994,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $467,000 and these shares are no longer included in our issued and outstanding shares. We anticipate we will purchase fewer shares, if any, under the share repurchase plan during 2021 than were purchased during 2020, depending on market conditions and the price of our common stock.
At the Market Offering
On February 2, 2021, we entered into an at-the-market offering agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“Wainwright”), establishing an at-the-market equity program (the “ATM Program”). Pursuant to the ATM Program, we may, from time-to-time issue and sell shares of our common stock (the “Shares”) to the public through Wainwright on the NYSE American exchange. No sales of the Shares will be made in Canada, including on the TSX. By definition, the offering price of shares sold in an at-the-market offering is based on a price in line with the current market price of the security. We will determine, at our sole discretion, the timing and number of Shares to be sold. The net proceeds of any sales of the Shares under the ATM Program would be used for primarily for operational expenditures, to maintain our working capital balances and for general corporate purposes. We are not obligated to make any sales of Shares under the ATM Agreement. Concurrent with entering into the ATM Agreement, we filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement, qualifying the offer and sale of the Shares having an aggregate offering price of up to US$9,000,000 through the ATM Program. We anticipate we will sell a portion of the available Shares during 2021 to provide additional working capital.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
(e). Cash Flows
Net cash used in operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to $1,010,000 compared to $2,639,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of (i) the Drilling Program, which included the use of cash of $1,580,000, during 2019 compared to no use of cash for the Drilling Program during 2020, as the
Drilling Program was completed in 2019 and (ii) a decrease in general and administrative expense, excluding non-cash stock option compensation to $729,000 during 2020 compared to $1,025,000 during 2019. Partially offsetting this decreased use of cash in operations was (i) no mineral property revenue during 2020 compared to mineral property revenue to $408,000 during 2019 for the Royalty Sale, of which $186,000 was received in cash and (ii) a reduction in interest income to $127,000 during 2020 compared to interest income of $252,000 during 2019. These items are discussed in further detail above under “Results of Operations.”
Net cash provided by investing activities decreased to $976,000 during 2020 compared to net cash provided of $3,109,000 during 2019. The primary source of cash during 2019 was the sale of short-term investments of $3,338,000 compared to $974,000 during 2020, with the bulk of the cash from the sales of short-term investments in 2019 used (i) to fund the Drilling Program and (ii) to purchase $233,000 of Vendetta units, described above, with no similar items in 2020. We anticipate we will continue to utilize proceeds from the sale of our short-term investments and any proceeds we may derive from the ATM Program, discussed above in Liquidity and Capital Resources to fund our operations during 2021.
Our net cash provided by financing activities during 2020 included $70,000 from the PPP Loan, with no similar item during 2019. We used cash of $5,000 during 2020 and $13,000 during 2019 for the repurchase of common stock for cancellation. We do not anticipate receiving any additional PPP Loan funds during 2021 and we anticipate we may not repurchase shares of common stock during 2021. However, we may sell shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program as a source of financing for working capital during 2021.
(f). Development Activities, Exploration Activities, Environmental Compliance and Contractual Obligations
Development Activities
We do not have any ongoing mineral development activities, which are activities for the development of mineral properties with reserves for potential mining.
Exploration Activities
A historically significant part of our business involves the review of potential property acquisitions and continuing review and analysis of properties in which we have an interest to determine the exploration and development potential of the properties. In analyzing expected levels of expenditures for work commitments and property payments, our obligations to make such payments fluctuate greatly depending on whether, among other things, we make a decision to sell a property interest, convey a property interest to a joint venture, or allow our interest in a property to lapse by not making the work commitment or payment required. In acquiring many of our interests in mining claims and leases, we have entered into agreements, which generally may be canceled at our option. We are often required to make minimum rental and option payments in order to maintain our interest in certain claims and leases. Our net 2020 mineral and surface property rental and option payments, included in exploration expense, were $10,000. Our 2021 total exploration property rentals and option payments for properties we own, have under joint venture, or operate are estimated to be approximately $788,000. Assuming that our joint ventures continue in their current status and that we do not appreciably change our property positions on existing properties, we estimate that our joint venture partners will pay on our behalf or reimburse us approximately $780,000 of these annual payments. These obligations are detailed below under “Contractual Obligations.” In addition, we may be required to make further payments in the future if we elect to exercise our options under those agreements or if we enter into new agreements.
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. We are required to obtain permits in advance of initiating certain of our exploration activities, to monitor and report on certain activities to appropriate authorities, and to perform remediation of environmental disturbance as a result of certain of our activities. Historically, the nature of our activities of review, acquisition and exploration of properties prior to the establishment of reserves, which may include mapping, sampling, geochemistry and geophysical studies as well as some limited exploration drilling, has not resulted in significant environmental impacts in the past. We have historically carried on our required environmental remediation expenditures and activities, if any, concurrently with our exploration activities and expenditures. The expenditures to comply with our environmental obligations are included in our exploration expenditures in the statement of operations and have not been material to our capital or exploration expenditures and have not had a material effect on our financial position. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have not capitalized any costs related to environmental control facilities. We do not anticipate our exploration activities will result in any material new or additional environmental expenditures or liabilities in the near future.
Contractual Obligations
The following table provides an analysis of our contractual obligations:
(1)
Lease obligation on our Wheat Ridge, Colorado office.
(2)
Mineral property payments under lease and property claim and concession payments for the next year, net of joint venture payments.
(g). Exploration Joint Ventures, Royalty and Other Properties
The following discussion relates to an analysis of our anticipated property exploration plans as of December 31, 2020. Please also see Note 2, “Mineral Properties,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and our discussion of our properties under Item 2, “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of all of our mineral properties.
Florida Canyon
The Florida Canyon project is an advanced-stage high-grade zinc project in Peru. Based on extensive exploration and development work conducted to date, we believe the property has potential to be developed into a mine over the next several years. The project is held in a joint venture between Nexa (61%) and Solitario (39%).
Solitario and Nexa jointly completed a PEA in 2017 that incorporated a variety of Nexa-generated prefeasibility studies into the analysis. The PEA evaluation included resource estimation, mining and processing recovery estimates, a preliminary mining and processing plan, infrastructure layout, environmental considerations and an economic analysis based on certain base case parameters. The PEA envisioned an underground mining operation with a 2,500 tonne per day floatation mill for processing, resulting in a 12.5-year mine life. Concentrates would be trucked to Nexa’s Cajamarquilla zinc smelter facility in Lima, Peru.
The terrain at Florida Canyon is steep and previous project access supporting surface and underground work programs was conducted by helicopter. The lack of road access restricted the scope of field activities to further advance the project. During 2019 and 2020 limited work was undertaken on road access to the project, and Nexa expects to continue to work on completing the road access during 2021. During 2019, Nexa completed the Drilling Program and several significant drill intercepts were encountered. Solitario reported the results of the drill intercepts in February 2021.
Nexa is currently working on two new drilling permits that will greatly expand the area available for exploration drilling. One of the permits would allow for 84 new drilling platforms and associated interconnecting roads scattered over an area approximately six kilometers by five kilometers. These proposed platforms are located immediately south, east and southeast of the current Florida Canyon drilling footprint. In addition, Nexa plans to conduct additional road construction in 2021 to access the mineralized areas of the project as well as local communities as part of their social commitment to these communities.
Solitario’s payments of $1,580,000 related to the Drilling Program were expensed as incurred, however the payments will be treated as an advance on Solitario’s commitment to fund 30% of any future development of Florida Canyon under the original joint venture agreement between Solitario and Nexa. Accordingly, in the event Florida Canyon is developed, which cannot be assured at this time, the funds paid to Nexa related to the Drilling Program will reduce the amount of Solitario’s obligation to fund 30% of future development costs, and / or repay any loans from Nexa for future development costs at Florida Canyon.
Lik project
The Lik project is an advanced-staged high-grade zinc project. The project is held in a joint venture between Teck (50%) and Solitario (50%).
Zazu completed a PEA in 2014 that incorporated a variety of prefeasibility studies into the analysis. These studies included resource estimation, mining and processing recovery estimates, a preliminary mining and processing plan, infrastructure layout, environmental considerations and an economic analysis based on the base case parameters. The PEA envisioned an open pit mining operation with a 5,500 ton per day floatation mill for processing resulting in a nine-year mine life. Concentrates would be handled through the DMTS road and port system that currently handles all concentrate produced by the nearby Red Dog zinc mine of Teck. The PEA analyzed the Lik project as a stand-alone operation building its own independent processing, tailings and port facilities.
Solitario and Teck are in discussions to jointly fund a 2021 exploration program with Teck acting as project manager. The program, if approved, consists of drilling four-to-five core holes totaling approximately 1,000 meters. Drill targets under consideration are extensions to the currently defined Lik deposit on the northeast, northwest and southern limits of the deposit, including one-hole testing for stacked mineralized horizons. Drilling is expected to begin during the 2021 summer field season. Besides drilling, a rigorous soil sampling program of up to 500 samples and an eight-line-kilometer induced polarization geophysical program is planned for an area northeast of the Lik deposit where there are indications of a second mineralized zone where no drilling has been conducted. We expect to reach a final decision on this program before the end of the first quarter of 2021. Teck will manage the 2021 exploration program as the designated operator during 2021, although Solitario will remain the operator of the joint venture in subsequent years.
Other Properties
Chambara
The project has been on care and maintenance in recent years. Significant geochemical anomalies and outcropping mineralization have been identified at several locations on the Chambara property. Nexa is responsible for maintaining the property in good standing and making all concession payments to the Peruvian government. Although concession costs in 2021 to be paid by Nexa are estimated to be $462,000, Solitario is fully carried and has no funding requirement at Chambara.
Gold Coin
We are currently evaluating the Gold Coin project exploration activities for 2021 and do not expect to have significant exploration expenditures for 2021, pending the results of our evaluation, and / or the availability of permits for drilling or other field activities. Our 2021 concession costs are estimated to be approximately $4,000.
2021 Planned Expenditures
Our 2021 total exploration and development budget is approximately $921,000 for our planned exploration expenditures. This amount includes a limited drilling program and evaluation of the Lik project, where we are responsible for 50% of the exploration expenditures. This amount does not include any significant expenditures for our Florida Canyon project where our joint venture partner, Nexa, is responsible for 100% of exploration costs, nor does it include any significant expenditures, such as drilling, at our newly acquired Gold Coin project, as we are evaluating planned exploration activities for 2021 at Gold Coin. We will continue the evaluation of potential new acquisitions of properties primarily in Peru and in other regions of North and South America. We expect to carry out our exploration activities during 2021 utilizing Teck at Lik, Nexa at Florida Canyon, and our own employees and contract geologists on our other projects.
(h). Discontinued Projects
During 2020 we recorded $6,000 of mineral property impairment related to our decision to abandon the La Promesa project in Peru. We had no mineral property impairments during 2019. We did sell certain royalty properties in the Royalty Sale during 2019.
