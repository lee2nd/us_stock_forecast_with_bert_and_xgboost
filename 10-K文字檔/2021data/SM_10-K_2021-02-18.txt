ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion includes forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements section of this report for important information about these types of statements.
Overview of the Company
General Overview
Our purpose is to make people’s lives better by responsibly producing energy supplies, contributing to domestic energy security and prosperity, and having a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. Our short-term operational and financial goals include generating positive cash flows while strengthening our balance sheet through absolute debt reduction and improved leverage metrics, and increasing the value of our capital project inventory through exploration and development optimization. Our long-term vision is to sustainably grow value for all of our stakeholders. We believe that in order to accomplish this vision, we must be a premier operator of top tier assets. Our investment portfolio is comprised of oil and gas producing assets in the state of Texas, specifically in the Midland Basin of West Texas and in the Maverick Basin of South Texas.
The Pandemic and associated macroeconomic events have had a significant impact on supply and demand for oil, gas, and NGLs, and affected the realized prices we received for our production throughout 2020. These impacts continue to be unpredictable, and given the dynamic nature of the Pandemic, we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of time that the related market conditions will exist or the extent to which they will continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, or the timing of any further recovery. Future infection rate surges or outbreaks could have further negative impacts, and as a result, we may be required to adjust our business plan. For additional detail, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
The safety of our employees, contractors, and the communities where we work remains our first priority as we continue to operate during the Pandemic. While our core business operations require certain individuals to be physically present at well site locations, substantially all of our office-based employees have continued working remotely in order to limit physical interactions and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and will continue to do so well into 2021. For individuals who are unable to perform their jobs remotely, we maintain and continually assess procedures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing and enhanced sanitization measures, and we continue to communicate to and train all of our employees regarding best practices for maintaining a healthy and safe work environment. We believe that we meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidelines related to the prevention of the transmission of COVID-19. Since these measures were initially implemented in the first quarter of 2020, we have continued to operate without significant disruptions to our business operations. Our pre-existing control environment and internal controls continue to be effective and we continue to address new risks directly related to the Pandemic as we identify them.
Despite continuing negative impacts and future uncertainty, we expect to maintain our ability to sustain strong operational performance and financial stability while maximizing returns, improving leverage metrics, and increasing the value of our top tier Midland Basin and South Texas assets. Our financial risk management program significantly reduced the impact of substantially lower oil prices in 2020, and as a result of this program, we recorded a net oil derivative settlement gain of $14.40 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our realized oil price before the effects of derivative settlements was $37.08 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020. In response to the economic environment during 2020, we renegotiated certain contracts resulting in realized and future cost savings that directly support our objective of maximizing cash flows. As a result of these cost saving measures and improving operational efficiencies, average well costs for 2020 were lower than our preliminary expectations for the year. We entered 2020 with a total capital program budget between $825 million and $850 million. However, given the impacts of the Pandemic and the related circumstances discussed above, we reduced our 2020 capital program by more than 25 percent. Please refer to the caption Costs Incurred below for additional discussion.
Our vision to sustainably grow value for all of our stakeholders includes near-term operational and financial goals of generating positive cash flows while strengthening our balance sheet through absolute debt reduction and improved leverage metrics. Our long-term plan is to deliver cash flow growth that is supported by our high-quality asset base and ability to generate favorable returns. We remain committed to exceptional safety, health, and environmental stewardship; supporting the professional development of a diverse and thriving team of employees; making a positive difference in the communities where we live and work; and transparency in reporting on our progress in these areas. The Environmental, Social and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees, among other things, the development and implementation of the Company’s environmental, social and governance policies, programs and initiatives, and reports to our Board of Directors regarding such matters. Further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable operations, compensation for our executives and employees under our short-term and long-term incentive plans is calculated based on metrics that include environmental, health, and safety measures. Please refer to our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed within 120 days from December 31, 2020, for additional discussion.
2020 Financial and Operational Highlights
We remain focused on maximizing returns and increasing the value of our top tier Midland Basin and South Texas assets. We expect to do this through continued development optimization of our Midland Basin assets and through further development of our Austin Chalk formation in South Texas. We believe our assets provide strong returns and are capable of providing for growth of
internally generated cash flows while allowing for flexibility of production levels, which aligns with our priorities of improving leverage metrics and maintaining strong financial flexibility.
The financial results and operational activities discussed throughout this report reflect the impacts of the Pandemic during 2020, and the misalignment of supply and demand caused by competition among oil producing nations for crude oil market share during the first half of 2020. We will continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment and maintain flexibility to adjust our financial and operational plans as warranted.
Financial and Operational Results. Average net daily production for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 126.9 MBOE, compared with 132.3 MBOE for 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a 21 percent decrease in daily production volumes from our South Texas assets, partially offset by a 10 percent increase in daily production volumes from our Midland Basin assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with 2019, net daily production volumes decreased four percent as a result of proactive measures taken to respond to the lower commodity price environment experienced in 2020 compared with 2019. This included voluntary production curtailments and less costs incurred as a result of intentionally reducing the number of new wells completed and brought on production. Realized prices before the effects of derivative settlements for oil, gas, and NGLs decreased 31 percent, 25 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. As a result of decreased realized prices, oil, gas, and NGL production revenue decreased 29 percent to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $1.6 billion for 2019. We recorded a net derivative gain of $161.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net derivative loss of $97.5 million for 2019. These amounts include derivative settlement gains of $351.3 million and $39.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Overall financial and operational activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulted in the following:
•a net loss of $764.6 million, or $6.72 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with a net loss of $187.0 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, for 2019. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by impairment expense of $1.0 billion, partially offset by a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $280.1 million, and a net derivative gain of $161.6 million. Please refer to Comparison of Financial Results and Trends Between 2020 and 2019 and Between 2019 and 2018 below for additional discussion regarding the components of net income (loss) for each period presented;
•a $492.1 million decrease in the principal balance of our total outstanding long-term debt from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the Exchange Offers and open market repurchases of certain of our senior notes at a discount and net cash provided by operating activities of $790.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was in excess of net cash used in investing activities of $555.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to Analysis of Cash Flow Changes Between 2020 and 2019 and Between 2019 and 2018 and to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report below for additional discussion including the definition of Exchange Offers;
•adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the year ended December 31, 2020, of $975.4 million, compared with $993.4 million for 2019, primarily resulted from decreased revenue resulting from depressed commodity prices during the year ended December 31, 2020, largely offset by increased derivative settlement gains, combined with lower operating costs during 2020. Please refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for additional discussion, including our definition of adjusted EBITDAX and reconciliations to our net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities; and
•total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2020, decreased 12 percent from December 31, 2019, to 404.6 MMBOE, of which, 57 percent were liquids (oil and NGLs) and 57 percent were characterized as proved developed. The decrease in total proved reserves primarily related to 46.4 MMBOE produced during 2020 and 32.6 MMBOE removed as a result of lower commodity prices experienced in 2020 compared with 2019, using pricing estimates determined in accordance with SEC rules. Our proved reserve life index decreased to 8.7 years as of December 31, 2020, compared with 9.6 years as of December 31, 2019. Please refer to Reserves in Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this report for additional discussion. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, which was a decrease of 35 percent year-over-year. Please refer to Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Operational Activities. The performance of the RockStar area of our Midland Basin position continues to exceed our pre-acquisition expectations and was key to driving significant growth in our operating margin and cash flows from operations in 2020 due to the high percentage of oil that wells in this area produce. Our operational execution and development strategy in this area have resulted in strong well performance due to enhanced completion designs and our ability to drill long laterals given the increasingly contiguous nature of our acreage position as a result of successful infill leasing and acreage trades. Efficiency and optimization in completions and operations continued in 2020. A large portion of our water transportation and disposal needs continue to be satisfied by the water facilities we operate in a core area of our RockStar acreage, and strong partnerships with our key service providers allowed us to maintain continuity of operations during the lower commodity price environment and the Pandemic.
Our Midland Basin program averaged four drilling rigs and two completion crews during 2020. We completed 80 gross (73 net) operated wells during 2020 and increased production volumes year-over-year by 11 percent to 29.1 MMBOE, 73 percent of which
was oil production. 80 percent of our total 2020 costs incurred related to our Midland Basin program. Drilling and completion activities within our RockStar and Sweetie Peck positions in the Midland Basin continue to focus primarily on delineating and developing the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations.
Our South Texas program averaged one drilling rig and operated one completion crew at times during 2020. We completed 4 gross (4 net) wells during 2020. Total production for 2020 was 17.3 MMBOE, a 21 percent decrease from 2019. 13 percent of our total 2020 costs incurred related to our South Texas program. Drilling and completion activities in South Texas during 2020 primarily focused on delineating and developing the Austin Chalk formation.
The table below provides a summary of changes in our drilled but not completed well count and current year drilling and completion activity in our operated programs for the year ended December 31, 2020:
____________________________________________
(1) Includes adjustments related to normal business activities, including working interest changes for existing drilled but not completed wells. Working interest changes can result from divestitures, joint development agreements, farmouts, and other activities.
(2) The South Texas drilled but not completed well count as of December 31, 2020, includes 13 gross (13 net) wells that are not included in our five-year development plan, 12 of which are in the Eagle Ford shale.
Costs Incurred. Costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration, and development activities, whether capitalized or expensed, are summarized as follows:
____________________________________________
Note: Total may not calculate due to rounding.
(1) Please refer to the caption Costs Incurred in Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The majority of our development and exploration costs were incurred in our Midland Basin and South Texas programs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Of these costs, $454.5 million was incurred in the development of our Midland Basin assets, which resulted in 84 net wells drilled and 73 net wells completed, while $75.0 million was incurred in the development of our South Texas assets, which resulted in 14 net wells drilled and 4 net wells completed. Costs incurred for acquisitions during the year related to transactions in the Midland Basin, as well as payments made to extend certain lease terms and to acquire new leases. Please refer to Operational Activities above and Acquisition Activity below for additional information.
Production Results. The table below presents the disaggregation of our production by product type for each of our programs for the year ended December 31, 2020:
____________________________________________
Note: Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.
Production decreased four percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a 21 percent decrease in production volumes from our South Texas assets, partially offset by an 11 percent increase in production volumes from our Midland Basin assets for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. Please refer to A Year-to-Year Overview of Selected Production and Financial Information, Including Trends and Comparison of Financial Results and Trends Between 2020 and 2019 and Between 2019 and 2018 below for additional discussion on production.
Acquisition Activity. During 2020, we completed a non-monetary acreage trade of primarily undeveloped properties located in Upton County, Texas, as well as acreage acquisitions in Martin County, Texas, in order to continue maximizing our operational efficiencies in our Midland Basin program. Please refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Oil, Gas, and NGL Prices
Our financial condition and the results of our operations are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our oil, gas, and NGL production, which can fluctuate dramatically. When we refer to realized oil, gas, and NGL prices below, the disclosed price represents the average price for the respective period, before the effects of derivative settlements, unless otherwise indicated. While quoted NYMEX oil and gas and OPIS NGL prices are generally used as a basis for comparison within our industry, the prices we receive are affected by quality, energy content, location and transportation differentials, and contracted pricing benchmarks for these products.
The following table summarizes commodity price data, as well as the effects of derivative settlements, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
____________________________________________
(1) Average OPIS prices per barrel of NGL, historical or strip, assumes a composite barrel product mix of 37% Ethane, 32% Propane, 6% Isobutane, 11% Normal Butane, and 14% Natural Gasoline for all periods presented. This product mix represents the industry standard composite barrel and does not necessarily represent our product mix for NGL production. Realized prices reflect our actual product mix.
During 2020, benchmark prices for oil were impacted by the misalignment of supply and demand caused by the Pandemic and other macroeconomic events. In addition to supply and demand fundamentals, as a global commodity, the price of oil is affected by real or perceived geopolitical risks in various regions of the world as well as the relative strength of the United States dollar compared to other currencies. We expect future benchmark prices for oil, gas, and NGLs to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Our realized prices at local sales points may also be affected by infrastructure capacity in the area of our operations and beyond.
The following table summarizes 12-month strip prices for NYMEX WTI oil, NYMEX Henry Hub gas, and OPIS NGLs as of February 4, 2021, and December 31, 2020:
We use financial derivative instruments as part of our financial risk management program. We have a financial risk management policy governing our use of derivatives, and decisions regarding entering into commodity derivative contracts are overseen by a financial risk management committee consisting of senior executive officers and finance personnel. The amount of our production covered by derivatives is driven by the amount of debt on our balance sheet, the level of capital commitments and long-term obligations we have in place, and our ability to enter into favorable commodity derivative contracts. With our current commodity derivative contracts, we believe we have partially reduced our exposure to volatility in commodity prices and basis differentials in the near term. Our use of costless collars for a portion of our derivatives allows us to participate in some of the upward movements in oil and gas prices while also setting a price floor for a portion of our oil and gas production. Please refer to Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report and to Commodity Price Risk in Overview of Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information regarding our oil, gas, and NGL derivatives.
Outlook
Our total 2021 capital program is budgeted between $650.0 million and $675.0 million, which we expect to fund with cash flows from operations. We expect to focus our 2021 capital program on highly economic oil development projects in both our Midland Basin assets and our South Texas assets. In South Texas, we intend to primarily target the Austin Chalk formation. None of these assets are located on federal lands, and therefore our operations will not be impacted by the recent suspension of the issuance of federal drilling permits.

A Year-to-Year Overview of Selected Production and Financial Information, Including Trends
____________________________________________
(1) Amounts and percentage changes may not calculate due to rounding.
(2) Derivative settlements for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, are included within the net derivative (gain) loss line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (“accompanying statements of operations”).
Average net daily equivalent production for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased four percent compared with 2019, as a result of proactive measures taken to respond to the lower commodity price environment experienced in 2020 compared with 2019. This included voluntary production curtailments and less costs incurred as a result of intentionally reducing the number of new wells completed and brought on production. The decrease in average net daily equivalent production volumes was primarily driven by a 21 percent decrease in daily production volumes from our South Texas assets, partially offset by a 10 percent increase in daily production volumes from our Midland Basin assets. We expect both total production volumes and oil volumes as a percentage of our total production mix to increase in 2021 compared with 2020. Please refer to Comparison of Financial Results and Trends Between 2020 and 2019 and Between 2019 and 2018 below for additional discussion.
We present certain information on a per BOE basis in order to evaluate our performance relative to our peers and to identify and measure trends we believe may require additional analysis and discussion.
Our realized price before the effect of derivative settlements on a per BOE basis decreased $8.58 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019, primarily driven by lower benchmark commodity prices for oil, gas, and NGLs resulting from the Pandemic and other macroeconomic events. Regional pricing differentials in the Midland Basin negatively affected our realized prices in 2020 and 2019. The negative impacts on revenue associated with the decrease in our realized price before the effect of derivative settlements on a per BOE basis was partially offset by an increase in the gain we recognized on the settlement of our derivative contracts of $6.76 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. Benchmark commodity prices improved toward the end of 2020 and into early 2021, however, negative impacts on our realized pricing resulting from the Pandemic and associated macroeconomic events could occur during 2021.
Lease operating expense (“LOE”) on a per BOE basis decreased 15 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced costs, reduced workover activity, and increased operational efficiencies during 2020. For 2021, we expect LOE on a per BOE basis to be relatively flat, compared with 2020, as we expect the benefit received from our cost reduction efforts and operational efficiencies to be offset by the expected increase in oil volumes as a percentage of our 2021 total production mix.
Transportation costs on a per BOE basis decreased 21 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. This decrease was driven by a 21 percent reduction in production volumes from our South Texas assets, which incur the majority of our transportation costs, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. We expect total transportation costs to fluctuate relative to changes in production from our South Texas assets. On a per BOE basis, we expect transportation costs to decrease in 2021, compared with 2020, as production from our Midland Basin assets, which is sold at or near the wellhead and incurs minimal transportation costs, continues to become a larger portion of our total production. Further, we anticipate natural declines in production from our Eagle Ford shale wells in South Texas, which incur higher transportation costs on a per BOE basis, and we intend to focus on new wells with higher liquids content in the Austin Chalk, which have lower transportation costs on a per BOE basis. In addition, we expect to benefit from certain transportation contract cost reductions which are expected to further reduce our transportation expense per BOE in 2021.
Production taxes on a per BOE basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased 27 percent compared with 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in realized prices. Our overall production tax rate for both of the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, was 4.1 percent. We expect our total production tax expense to increase in 2021, compared with 2020, as we expect oil, gas, and NGL production revenue to increase due to higher expected pricing based on 12-month strip prices as of February 4, 2021, and increased volumes. We generally expect production tax expense to correlate with oil, gas, and NGL production revenue on an absolute and per BOE basis. Product mix, the location of production, and incentives to encourage oil and gas development can also impact the amount of production tax we recognize.
Ad valorem tax expense on a per BOE basis decreased 15 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to changes in the assessed values of our producing properties recognized by respective tax authorities in 2020. We anticipate volatility in ad valorem tax expense on a per BOE and absolute basis as the valuation of our producing properties change.
Depletion, depreciation, amortization, and asset retirement obligation liability accretion (“DD&A”) expense on a per BOE basis remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. During 2020, decreases in DD&A expense, which were driven by the reduction in the depletable cost basis of our South Texas proved oil and gas properties as a result of proved property impairments recognized during the first quarter of 2020, were partially offset by higher production volumes from our oil producing Midland Basin assets as these assets have higher depletion rates than our primarily gas and NGL producing South Texas assets. Our DD&A rate fluctuates as a result of impairments, divestiture activity, carrying cost funding and sharing arrangements with third parties, changes in our production mix, and changes in our total estimated proved reserve volumes. In general, we expect the DD&A rate for 2021 to be relatively flat compared with 2020 and DD&A expense on an absolute basis to be higher compared with 2020, primarily as a result of anticipated higher production volumes.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expense on a per BOE basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased 22 percent, compared with 2019. This decrease was primarily due to reduced overhead costs resulting from the reorganization of certain functions in the fourth quarter of 2019 that eliminated duplicative regional operational functions, as well as actions taken to reduce costs
as a result of the Pandemic. For 2021, we expect G&A expense to remain relatively flat on an absolute basis and to decrease on a per BOE basis, compared with 2020.
Please refer to Comparison of Financial Results and Trends Between 2020 and 2019 and Between 2019 and 2018 for additional discussion of operating expenses.
Please refer to Note 9 - Earnings Per Share in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion on the types of shares included in our basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share calculations. We recorded a net loss for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019. Consequently, all potentially dilutive shares were anti-dilutive and were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net income and thus, considered dilutive shares in the calculation of diluted net income per common share.
Comparison of Financial Results and Trends Between 2020 and 2019 and Between 2019 and 2018
Please refer to Comparison of Financial Results and Trends Between 2019 and 2018 and Between 2018 and 2017 in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020, for a detailed discussion of certain comparisons of our financial results and trends for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with the year ended December 31, 2018.
Net equivalent production, production revenue, and production expense
The following table presents the changes in our net equivalent production, production revenue, and production expense, by area, between the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019:
____________________________________________
Note: Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.
Average net daily equivalent production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased four percent compared with 2019. Realized prices before the effects of derivative settlements for oil, gas, and NGLs decreased 31 percent, 25 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. As a result of the decreases in production and pricing, oil, gas, and NGL production revenue decreased 29 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. Total production expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased 22 percent, compared with 2019. Please refer to A Year-to-Year Overview of Selected Production and Financial Information, Including Trends for additional discussion of the components of production expense.
The following table presents the changes in our net equivalent production, production revenue, and production expense, by area, between the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018:
____________________________________________
Note: Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.
(1) We divested all remaining producing assets in the Rocky Mountain region in the first half of 2018. As a result, there have been no production volumes from this region after the second quarter of 2018.
Average net daily equivalent production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 10 percent compared with 2018, primarily as a result of increased production from our Midland Basin assets. As a result of increased Midland Basin production, oil production as a percentage of our overall product mix increased from 43 percent in 2018, to 45 percent in 2019. Oil, gas, and NGL production revenues decreased three percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018, as a result of lower
commodity pricing and the divestiture in the first half of 2018 of our remaining producing assets in the Rocky Mountain region. Total production expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased three percent compared with 2018, due to increased LOE and ad valorem tax expense, partially offset by decreased production taxes and transportation costs. Production expense on a per BOE basis decreased six percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to increased production volumes, decreased transportation costs, and decreased production taxes resulting from lower oil, gas, and NGL production revenues.
Net gain on divestiture activity
No material divestitures occurred during 2020 or 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a total net gain of $410.6 million for the divestiture of our Powder River Basin assets (the “PRB Divestiture”), and a combined total net gain of $15.4 million for the completed divestitures of our remaining assets in the Williston Basin located in Divide County, North Dakota (the “Divide County Divestiture”) and our Halff East assets in the Midland Basin (the “Halff East Divestiture”). Please refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Depletion, depreciation, amortization, and asset retirement obligation liability accretion
DD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased five percent compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in the depletable cost basis of our South Texas proved oil and gas properties as a result of proved property impairments recognized during the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by higher production volumes from our oil producing Midland Basin assets as these assets have higher depletion rates than our primarily gas and NGL producing South Texas assets. DD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 24 percent compared with 2018, primarily driven by a 25 percent increase in production volumes from our Midland Basin assets during the same period. Please refer to A Year-to-Year Overview of Selected Production and Financial Information, Including Trends above for discussion of DD&A expense on a per BOE basis.
Exploration
Exploration expense decreased 20 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by the reorganization of certain functions in the fourth quarter of 2019 that eliminated duplicative regional operational functions and reduced overhead costs. Exploration expense is impacted by actual geological and geophysical studies we perform and the potential for exploratory dry hole expense.
Impairment
As a result of the decrease in commodity price forecasts at the end of the first quarter of 2020, specifically decreases in oil and NGL prices, we recorded impairment expense related to our South Texas proved oil and gas properties and related support facilities. There were no proved oil and gas property impairments recorded in 2019, and 2018. Unproved property abandonments and impairments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, related to actual and anticipated lease expirations, as well as actual and anticipated losses of acreage due to title defects, changes in development plans, and other inherent acreage risks.
We expect proved property impairments to occur more frequently in periods of declining or depressed commodity prices, and that the frequency of unproved property abandonments and impairments will fluctuate with the timing of lease expirations or title defects, and changing economics associated with decreases in commodity prices. Additionally, changes in drilling plans, unsuccessful exploration activities, and downward engineering revisions may result in proved and unproved property impairments.
Reserve estimates and related impairments of proved and unproved properties are difficult to predict in a volatile price environment. If commodity prices for the products we produce decline as a result of supply and demand fundamentals associated with the Pandemic or other macroeconomic events, we may experience additional proved and unproved property impairments in the future. Future impairments of proved and unproved properties are difficult to predict; however, based on our commodity price assumptions as of February 4, 2021, we do not expect any material oil and gas property impairments in the first quarter of 2021 resulting from commodity price impacts.
Please refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional discussion.
General and administrative
G&A expense decreased 25 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. Please refer to A Year-to-Year Overview of Selected Production and Financial Information, Including Trends above for discussion of G&A expense.
Net derivative (gain) loss
We recognized a net derivative gain of $161.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The gain was primarily driven by gains on the settlement of derivative contracts of $351.3 million offset by $189.7 million in downward mark-to-market adjustments due to the strengthening of commodity prices towards the end of 2020.
We recognized a net derivative loss of $97.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss was primarily driven by $136.7 million in downward mark-to-market adjustments offset by gains on the settlement of derivative contracts of $39.2 million.
We recognized a net derivative gain of $161.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The gain was primarily driven by upward mark-to market adjustments of $297.6 million offset by losses on the settlement of derivative contracts of $135.8 million.
Please refer to Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Interest expense
Interest expense increased three percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to an increase in interest expense associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and a decrease in interest expense capitalized to wells. We expect interest expense related to our Senior Notes to be relatively flat in 2021 compared with 2020 as the increase related to the higher interest rate on the 2025 Senior Secured Notes will be mostly offset by the decreased interest associated with the reduction in the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes resulting from exchanges and redemptions in 2020. Total interest expense is impacted by, and can vary based on, the timing and amount of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Please refer to Overview of Liquidity and Capital Resources below, and to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion, including the definitions of 2025 Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes.
Net gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt
The Exchange Offers executed during the second quarter of 2020 resulted in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $227.3 million, which was primarily comprised of the gain on the partial principal redemption of Old Notes and the debt discount associated with the issuance of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased certain of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (“2022 Senior Notes”) and 5.0% Senior Notes due 2024 (“2024 Senior Notes”) in open market transactions, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $52.8 million, $15.5 million of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion, including the definitions of Exchange Offers and Old Notes.
Income tax (expense) benefit
The increase in the effective tax benefit rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019, was primarily due to the differing effects of permanent items on the loss before income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019. The valuation allowance recorded on our deferred tax assets combined with the effects of excess tax deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards, limits on expensing of certain covered individuals’ compensation, and other permanent expense items decreased the tax benefit rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. This decrease was partially offset by state permanent items reflecting state planning strategies which increased the tax benefit rate for the year ended December 31, 2020. Changes to the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) could eliminate or reduce certain oil and gas industry deductions and could increase the overall corporate income tax rate.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018, was primarily due to the differing effects of permanent items on the loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the impact of these items on income before income taxes for 2018. Excess tax deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards, limits on expensing of certain covered individual’s compensation, and other permanent expense items reduced the tax benefit rate for the year ended December 31, 2019. These same items increased the tax expense rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The reduction in the tax expense rate also reflects a cumulative effect in 2018 from divestitures, and the impact of a correlative change to our state apportionment rate.
Please refer to Overview of Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below as well as Note 4 - Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion.
Overview of Liquidity and Capital Resources
Based on the current commodity price environment, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to execute our business plan while continuing to meet our current financial obligations in a challenging commodity price environment. We continue to manage the duration and level of our drilling and completion service commitments in order to maintain flexibility with regard to our activity level and capital expenditures, and we have successfully renegotiated certain contracts allowing us to realize cost savings that directly support our objective of maximizing cash flows.
Sources of Cash
We expect our 2021 capital program to be funded by cash flows from operations. Although we expect cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our expected 2021 capital program, we may also use borrowings under our revolving credit facility or may elect to raise funds through new debt or equity offerings or from other sources of financing. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders could be diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders and bondholders. Additionally, we may enter into carrying cost and sharing arrangements with third parties for certain exploration or development programs. All of our sources of liquidity can be affected by the general conditions of the broader economy, force majeure events, fluctuations in commodity prices, operating costs, tax law changes and volumes produced, all of which affect us and our industry.
As a result of the current macroeconomic environment, our credit ratings were downgraded during 2020 by three major credit rating agencies. These downgrades and any future downgrades in our credit ratings could make it more difficult or expensive for us to borrow additional funds.
We have no control over the market prices for oil, gas, or NGLs, although we may be able to influence the amount of our realized revenues from our oil, gas, and NGL sales through the use of derivative contracts as part of our commodity price risk management program. Commodity derivative contracts may limit the prices we receive for our oil, gas, and NGL sales if oil, gas, or NGL prices rise substantially over the price established by the commodity derivative contract. Please refer to Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about our oil, gas, and NGL derivative contracts currently in place and the timing of settlement of those contracts.
Credit Agreement
Our Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maximum loan amount of $2.5 billion, and a borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments of $1.1 billion. The borrowing base under the Credit Agreement is subject to regular, semi-annual redetermination, and considers the value of both our (a) proved oil and gas properties reflected in the most recent reserve report provided to our lenders under the Credit Agreement; and (b) commodity derivative contracts, each as determined by our lender group. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed the fall semi-annual borrowing base redetermination with our lenders, and entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which among other items, reaffirmed the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments at existing levels and extended the date through which we may incur Permitted Second Lien Debt, as defined in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2020, we had $380.8 million of Permitted Second Lien Debt capacity available until the next scheduled redetermination date of April 1, 2021, provided that all principal amounts of such debt are used to redeem unsecured senior debt of the Company for less than or equal to 80% of par value. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement provided $965.0 million in liquidity. Our borrowing base can be adjusted as a result of changes in commodity prices, acquisitions or divestitures of proved properties, or financing activities, all as provided for in the Credit Agreement. No individual bank participating in our Credit Agreement represents more than 10 percent of the lender commitments under the Credit Agreement. Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion as well as the presentation of the outstanding balance, total amount of letters of credit, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement as of February 4, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.
We must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants under the terms of the Credit Agreement, including covenants limiting dividend payments and requiring that we maintain certain financial ratios, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2020, and through the filing of this report. Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Our daily weighted-average revolving credit facility debt balance was approximately $145.6 million and $115.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Cash flows provided by our operating activities, proceeds received from divestitures of properties, capital markets activities, including open market debt repurchases, repayment of scheduled debt maturities, and our capital expenditures, including acquisitions, all impact the amount we borrow under our revolving credit facility.
Under our Credit Agreement, borrowings in the form of Eurodollar loans accrue interest based on LIBOR. The use of LIBOR as a global reference rate is expected to be discontinued after 2021. Our Credit Agreement specifies that if LIBOR is no longer a widely used benchmark rate, or if it is no longer used for determining interest rates for loans in the United States, a replacement interest rate that fairly reflects the cost to the lenders of funding loans shall be established by the Administrative Agent, as defined in the Credit Agreement, in consultation with us. We currently do not expect the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact on interest expense
or borrowing activities under the Credit Agreement, or to otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this report for discussion of FASB ASU 2020-04 which provides guidance related to reference rate reform.
Weighted-Average Interest and Weighted-Average Borrowing Rates
Our weighted-average interest rate includes paid and accrued interest, fees on the unused portion of the aggregate commitment amount under the Credit Agreement, letter of credit fees, the non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs, and the non-cash amortization of the discounts related to the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and 2021 Senior Secured Convertible Notes, each as defined in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our weighted-average borrowing rate includes paid and accrued interest only.
The following table presents our weighted-average interest rates and our weighted-average borrowing rates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
Our weighted-average interest rates and weighted-average borrowing rates are impacted by the timing of long-term debt issuances and redemptions and the average outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. Additionally, our weighted-average interest rates are impacted by the fees paid on the unused portion of our aggregate lender commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our weighted-average interest rate and our weighted-average borrowing rate increased, compared with 2019, primarily as a result of the higher interest rate on our 2025 Senior Secured Notes issued during the second quarter of 2020. The rates disclosed in the above table do not reflect amounts associated with the early redemption of certain of our Old Notes, such as the acceleration of unamortized deferred financing costs, as these amounts are netted against the associated gain or loss on extinguishment of debt. Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion including the definition of Old Notes.
Uses of Cash
We use cash for the development, exploration, and acquisition of oil and gas properties and for the payment of operating and general and administrative costs, income taxes, dividends, and debt obligations, including interest. Expenditures for the development, exploration, and acquisition of oil and gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. During 2020, we spent approximately $555.7 million on capital expenditures and on acquiring proved and unproved oil and gas properties. This amount differs from the costs incurred amount of $585.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as costs incurred is an accrual-based amount that also includes asset retirement obligations, geological and geophysical expenses, and exploration overhead amounts. Please refer to Costs Incurred in Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
The amount and allocation of our future capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors, including our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, our ability to execute our development program, and the number and size of acquisitions. In addition, the impact of oil, gas, and NGL prices on investment opportunities, the availability of capital, tax law changes, and the timing and results of our exploration and development activities may lead to changes in funding requirements for future development. We periodically review our capital expenditure budget to assess if changes are necessary based on current and projected cash flows, acquisition and divestiture activities, debt requirements, and other factors. The macroeconomic events discussed throughout this report impacted our capital program in 2020. We are unable to reasonably estimate the period of time that these market conditions will exist, the extent of the impact they will have on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition, or the timing of any subsequent recovery.
Changes to the IRC could increase the corporate income tax rate and could eliminate or reduce current tax deductions for intangible drilling costs, depreciation of equipment costs, and other deductions which currently reduce our taxable income. Future legislation regarding these issues could reduce our net cash provided by operating activities over time, and could therefore result in a reduction of funding available for the items discussed above.
We may from time to time repurchase or redeem all or portions of our outstanding debt securities for cash, through exchanges for other securities, or a combination of both. Such repurchases or redemptions may be made in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Any such repurchases or redemptions will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, compliance with securities laws, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transaction may be material. During 2020, we completed the Exchange Offers, as defined in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report, and we repurchased certain of our 2022 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in open market transactions.
The balance of our revolving credit facility decreased $29.5 million from $122.5 million at December 31, 2019, to $93.0 million at December 31, 2020, notwithstanding repurchases of $243.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Unsecured Notes, as defined in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report, and 2021 Senior Convertible Notes for $190.0 million in cash during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion. As part of our strategy for 2021, we will continue to focus on improving our debt metrics, which may include reducing the amount of our outstanding debt.
As of the filing of this report, we could repurchase up to 3,072,184 shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors, including certain provisions of our Credit Agreement, the indentures governing each series of our outstanding Senior Notes, as defined in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report, compliance with securities laws, and the terms and provisions of our stock repurchase program. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews this program as part of the allocation of our capital. During 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock, and we currently do not plan to repurchase any outstanding shares of our common stock during 2021.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we paid $2.3 million, $11.3 million, and $11.2 million, respectively, in dividends to our stockholders. These amounts reflect a dividend of $0.02 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a dividend of $0.10 per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018. Our current intention is to continue to make dividend payments for the foreseeable future, subject to our future earnings, our financial condition, covenants under our Credit Agreement and indentures governing each series of our outstanding Senior Notes, other covenants, and other factors that could arise. The payment and amount of future dividends remains at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
Analysis of Cash Flow Changes Between 2020 and 2019 and Between 2019 and 2018
The following tables present changes in cash flows between the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, for our operating, investing, and financing activities. The analysis following each table should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows (“accompanying statements of cash flows”) in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the same period in 2019 primarily due to a $316.9 million decrease in cash received from oil, gas, and NGL production revenues, net of transportation costs and production taxes, offset by an increase in cash received from settled derivative trades of $290.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is affected by working capital changes and the timing of cash receipts and disbursements.
Derivative settlements increased $202.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018. This increase was partially offset by decreased cash received from oil, gas, and NGL production revenues, net of transportation costs and production taxes of $73.4 million, and increased cash paid for LOE and ad valorem taxes of $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018. Cash paid for interest decreased $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018, due to the redemption and repurchase of certain senior notes in the third quarter of 2018, partially offset by increased interest paid on our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2027 (“2027 Senior Notes”) and interest paid on revolving credit facility borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the same period in 2019, primarily due to reduced capital expenditures of $476.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, was funded by net cash provided by operating activities.
Net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018. Proceeds received from the sale of oil and gas properties were $735.5 million lower in 2019 than in 2018 as no material divestitures occurred during 2019. This was partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $279.4 million and less cash paid to acquire proved and unproved oil and gas properties of $30.7 million.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $136.5 million to repurchase certain of our 2022 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in open market transactions, and we paid $53.5 million to certain holders of the 2021 Senior Convertible Notes in connection with the Private Exchange. Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion and definitions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net repayments to our revolving credit facility of $29.5 million, compared to net borrowings of $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid approximately $845.0 million, including premiums, to redeem or repurchase certain of our senior notes, and we received net proceeds of $492.1 million upon the issuance of our 2027 Senior Notes, as defined in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report. There were no such debt transactions during 2019. Net borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with no borrowings on our revolving credit facility during 2018.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rate associated with any outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had a $93.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility. Our Credit Agreement allows us to fix the interest rate for all or a portion of the principal balance of our revolving credit facility for a period up to six months. To the extent that the interest rate is fixed, interest rate changes will affect the revolving credit facility’s fair value but will not impact results of operations or cash flows. Conversely, for the portion of the revolving credit facility that has a floating interest rate, interest rate changes will not affect the fair value but will impact future results of operations and cash flows. Changes in interest rates do not impact the amount of interest we pay on our fixed-rate Senior Unsecured Notes or fixed-rate Senior Secured Notes but can impact their fair values. As of December 31, 2020, our outstanding principal amount of fixed-rate debt totaled $2.2 billion and our floating-rate debt outstanding totaled $93.0 million. Please refer to Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion on the fair values of our Senior Notes.
Commodity Price Risk
The prices we receive for our oil, gas, and NGL production directly impact our revenue, profitability, access to capital, and future rate of growth. Oil, gas, and NGL prices are subject to unpredictable fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including changes in supply and demand and the macroeconomic environment, all of which are typically beyond our control. The markets for oil, gas, and NGLs have been volatile, especially over the last several years. During the first half of 2020, oil, gas, and NGL prices weakened to historic lows as a result of the Pandemic and other macroeconomic events and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The realized prices we receive for our production also depend on numerous factors that are typically beyond our control. Based on our 2020 production, a 10 percent decrease in our average realized oil, gas, and NGL prices, before the effects of derivative settlements, would have reduced our oil, gas, and NGL production revenues by approximately $85.4 million, $18.7 million, and $8.5 million, respectively. If commodity prices had been 10 percent lower, our net derivative settlements for the year ended December 31, 2020, would have offset the declines in oil, gas, and NGL production revenue by approximately $85.2 million.
We enter into commodity derivative contracts in order to reduce the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices. The fair value of our commodity derivative contracts is largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices. As of December 31, 2020, a 10 percent increase or decrease in the forward curves associated with our oil, gas, and NGL commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net derivative positions for these products by approximately $135.3 million, $28.0 million, and $7.5 million, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
We evaluate our transactions to determine if any variable interest entities exist. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, that entity is consolidated into our consolidated financial statements. We have not been involved in any unconsolidated SPE transactions during 2020 or 2019, or through the filing of this report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have outlined below, those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment.
Successful Efforts Method of Accounting. GAAP provides two alternative methods for the oil and gas industry to use in accounting for oil and gas producing activities. These two methods are generally known in our industry as the full cost method and the successful efforts method. Both methods are widely used. The methods are different enough that in many circumstances the same set of facts will provide materially different financial statement results within a given year. We have chosen the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. A more detailed description is included in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities. Our estimated proved reserve quantities and future net cash flows are critical to understanding the value of our business. They are used in comparative financial ratios and are the basis for significant accounting estimates in our consolidated financial statements, including the calculations of DD&A expense, impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, and asset retirement obligations. Please refer to Oil and Gas Producing Activities in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion on our accounting policies impacted by estimated reserve quantities.
Future cash inflows and future production and development costs are determined by applying prices and costs, including transportation, quality differentials, and basis differentials, applicable to each period to the estimated quantities of proved reserves remaining to be produced as of the end of that period. Expected cash flows are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. For example, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows calculation requires that a 10 percent discount rate be applied. Although reserve estimates are inherently imprecise, and estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than those of established producing oil and gas properties, we make a considerable effort in estimating our reserves. We engage Ryder Scott, an independent reservoir evaluation consulting firm, to audit at least 80 percent of our total calculated proved reserve PV-10. We expect proved reserve estimates will change as additional information becomes available and as commodity prices and operating and capital costs change. We evaluate and estimate our proved reserves each year end. It should not be assumed that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (GAAP) or PV-10 (non-GAAP) as of December 31, 2020, is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based these measures on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price of each month within the trailing 12-month period ended December 31, 2020. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimates. Please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense will increase, which would reduce future net income. Changes in DD&A rate calculations caused by changes in reserve quantities are made prospectively. In addition, a decline in reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of proved and unproved properties for impairment. Impairments are recorded in the period in which they are identified.
The following table presents information about proved reserve changes from period to period due to items we do not control, such as price, and from changes due to production history and well performance. These changes do not require a capital expenditure on our part, but may have resulted from capital expenditures we incurred to develop other estimated proved reserves.
____________________________________________
Note: Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.
As previously noted, commodity prices are volatile and estimates of reserves are inherently imprecise. Consequently, we expect to continue experiencing these types of changes.
We cannot reasonably predict future commodity prices, although we believe that together, the below analyses provide reasonable information regarding the impact of changes in pricing and trends on total estimated proved reserves. The following table reflects the estimated MMBOE change and percentage change to our total reported estimated proved reserve volumes from the described hypothetical changes:
____________________________________________
(1) The change solely reflects the impact of a 10 percent decrease in SEC pricing to the total reported estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2020, and does not include additional impacts to our estimated proved reserves that may result from our internal intent to drill hurdles or changes in future service or equipment costs.
(2) The change solely reflects the impact of replacing SEC pricing with the five-year average NYMEX strip pricing as of December 31, 2020, and does not include additional impacts to our estimated proved reserves that may result from our internal intent to drill hurdles or changes in future service or equipment costs. As of December 31, 2020, SEC pricing was $39.57 per Bbl for oil, $1.99 per MMBtu for gas, and $17.64 per Bbl for NGLs, and five-year average NYMEX strip pricing was $46.16 per Bbl for oil, $2.54 per MMBtu for gas, and $20.45 per Bbl for NGLs.
(3) The change solely reflects a 10 percent decrease in proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020, and does not include any additional impacts to our estimated proved reserves.
Additional reserve information can be found in Reserves in Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this report, and in Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. Proved oil and gas properties are evaluated for impairment on a pool-by-pool basis and reduced to fair value when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. We estimate the expected future cash flows of our proved oil and gas properties and compare these undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will write down the carrying amount of the proved oil and gas properties to fair value (or discounted future cash flows). Management estimates future cash flows from all proved reserves and risk adjusted probable and possible reserves using various factors, which are subject to our judgment and expertise, and include, but are not limited to, commodity price forecasts, estimated future operating and capital costs, development plans, and discount rates to incorporate the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows.
Unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair value when there is an indication that the carrying costs may not be recoverable. Lease acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated by asset group and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive prior to lease expiration are amortized over the appropriate period. The estimate of what could be nonproductive is based on historical trends or other information, including current drilling plans and our intent to renew leases. We estimate the fair value of unproved properties using a market approach, which takes into account the following significant assumptions: remaining lease terms, future development plans, risk weighted potential resource recovery, estimated reserve
values, and estimated acreage value based on price(s) received for similar, recent acreage transactions by us or other market participants.
We cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded because of the uncertainty in the factors discussed above. Despite any amount of future impairment being difficult to predict, based on our commodity price assumptions as of February 4, 2021, we do not expect any material oil and gas property impairments in the first quarter of 2021 resulting from commodity price impacts.
Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for discussion of impairments of oil and gas properties recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Fair Value of the Debt Exchange Transactions. The Exchange Offers executed in the second quarter of 2020 required significant judgment in evaluating the application of the applicable accounting guidance, and significant assumptions were made in estimating the fair value of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and warrants issued. Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion and definitions.
Revenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, our revenue recognition policy was updated to reflect the adoption of new accounting guidance. Our revenue recognition policy is a critical accounting policy because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and our forward-looking statements contained in our analysis of liquidity and capital resources. Our primary source of revenue is derived by the sale of produced oil, gas, and NGLs. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when custody and title (“control”) of the product, as defined by contractual terms, transfers to the purchaser. Payment for these sales is typically received between 30 and 90 days after the date of production. At the end of each month, we make estimates of the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price we will receive. We use our knowledge of our properties, contractual arrangements, historical performance, NYMEX, local spot market, and OPIS prices, and other factors as the basis for these estimates. Variances between our estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded in the month payment is received. A 10 percent change in our revenue accrual at year end 2020 would have impacted total operating revenues by approximately $10.9 million in 2020. Please refer to Note 2 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Derivative Financial Instruments. We periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil, gas, and NGL price volatility and location differentials. We recognize all gains and losses from changes in commodity derivative fair values immediately in earnings rather than deferring any such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The estimated fair value of our derivative instruments requires substantial judgment. These values are based upon, among other things, option pricing models, futures prices, volatility, time to maturity, and credit risk. The values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Income Taxes. We account for deferred income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts on the consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured using currently enacted tax rates. These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled, respectively. Considerable judgment is required in predicting when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not. We record deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances, when appropriate, to reflect amounts more likely than not to be realized based upon Company analysis. Additionally, our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period, as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits, and net operating and capital loss carryforwards and carrybacks. Adjustments related to differences between the estimates we use and actual amounts we report are recorded in the periods in which we file our income tax returns. These adjustments and changes in our estimates of asset recovery and liability settlement as well as significant enacted tax rate changes could have an impact on our results of operations. A one percent change in our effective tax rate would have changed our calculated income tax benefit by approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 - Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion.
Accounting Matters
Please refer to Recently Issued Accounting Standards in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information on new authoritative accounting guidance.
Environmental
We believe we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations and do not currently anticipate that material future expenditures will be required under the existing regulatory framework. However, environmental laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes, and we are unable to predict the impact that compliance with future laws or regulations, such as those currently being considered as discussed below, may have on future capital expenditures, liquidity, and results of operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. For additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, please refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Oil and Gas Operations and the Industry - Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.
Climate Change. In June 2013, President Obama announced a Climate Action Plan designed to further reduce GHG emissions and prepare the nation for the physical effects that may occur as a result of climate change. The Climate Action Plan targeted methane reductions from the oil and gas sector as part of a comprehensive interagency methane strategy. As part of the Climate Action Plan, on May 12, 2016, the EPA issued final regulations that amend and expand 2012 regulations for the oil and gas sector by setting emission limits for VOCs and methane, a GHG, and added requirements for previously unregulated sources. The 2016 NSPS requires reduction of methane and VOCs from certain activities in oil and gas production, processing, transmission and storage and applies to facilities constructed, modified, or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. The regulation requires, among other things, GHG and VOC emission limits for certain equipment, such as centrifugal compressors and reciprocating compressors; semi-annual leak detection and repair for well sites and quarterly boosting and garnering compressor stations and gas transmission compressor stations; control requirements and emission limits for pneumatic pumps; and additional requirements for control of GHGs and VOCs from well completions. On September 14, and 15, 2020, the EPA finalized amendments to the 2012 and 2016 NSPS that removed transmission and storage infrastructure from regulation of methane emissions and other VOCs, as well as removed methane control requirements. The Biden administration has directed the EPA to review and consider revising or rescinding these 2020 amendments, which could result in reinstatement of the previously adopted regulations or potentially more stringent requirements. On November 16, 2016, the BLM finalized regulations to address methane emissions from oil and gas operations on federal and tribal lands, as part of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan. The regulations were intended to reduce the waste of gas from flaring, venting, and leaks by oil and gas production. The rule included requirements that prohibits venting of gas except in limited circumstances and limits flaring of gas and includes requirements for leak detection and repair. The rule also increased royalty payments for “waste” gas that is released in contravention of the rule requirements. After continuous court challenges, the BLM issued a final rule in September 2018 that rescinded most of the 2016 rule, including most of the methane control requirements. The 2016 rule was vacated by the District Court for the District of Wyoming. Any future regulations requiring similar capture standards may increase our operational costs, or restrict our production, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
In August of 2015, the EPA finalized existing source performance standards as stringent state emission “goals” for utilities to reduce GHG emissions. The proposed standards focus on re-dispatching electricity from coal-fired units to gas combined cycle plants and renewables. In February 2016, however, the Supreme Court stayed these rules pending judicial review. The Trump EPA proposed a repeal of the rule based on a new legal interpretation of the EPA’s authority. The Trump EPA also proposed a replacement rule, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, in August 2018 and finalized the rule in June 2019. The D.C. Circuit struck down the Affordable Clean Energy Rule in January 2021.
The United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and many of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal. In addition, there have been international conventions and efforts to establish standards for the reduction of GHGs globally, including the Paris accords in December 2015. The conditions for entry into force of the Paris accords were met on October 5, 2016 and the Agreement went into force 30 days later on November 4, 2016. On November 4, 2019, President Trump formally notified the United Nations that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The November 4, 2019 formal notice triggered the start of a year-long withdrawal process. However, President Biden has signed a document pledging the United States’ entry back into the agreement.
The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Judicial challenges to new regulatory measures are likely and we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges. New regulatory suspensions, revisions, or rescissions and conflicting state and federal regulatory mandates may inhibit our ability to accurately forecast the costs associated with future regulatory compliance. Finally, scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere produce climate changes that likely have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events. Such effects could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
In terms of opportunities, the regulation of GHG emissions and the introduction of alternative incentives, such as enhanced oil recovery, carbon sequestration, and low carbon fuel standards, could benefit us in a variety of ways. For example, although federal regulation and climate change legislation could reduce the overall demand for the oil and gas that we produce, the relative demand for gas may increase because the burning of gas produces lower levels of emissions than other readily available fossil fuels such as oil and coal. In addition, if renewable resources, such as wind or solar power become more prevalent, gas-fired electric plants may provide an
alternative backup to maintain consistent electricity supply. Also, if states adopt low-carbon fuel standards, gas may become a more attractive transportation fuel. Approximately 37 percent and 38 percent of our production on a BOE basis in 2020 and 2019, respectively, was gas. Market-based incentives for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide in underground reservoirs, particularly in oil and gas reservoirs, could also benefit us through the potential to obtain GHG emission allowances or offsets from or government incentives for the sequestration of carbon dioxide.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDAX represents net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, amortization and asset retirement obligation liability accretion expense, exploration expense, property abandonment and impairment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, derivative gains and losses net of settlements, gains and losses on divestitures, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, and certain other items. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that we believe provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of our ability to internally generate funds for exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt. We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Agreement based on adjusted EBITDAX ratios as further described in the Credit Agreement section in Overview of Liquidity and Capital Resources above. In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or other profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. Our revolving credit facility provides a material source of liquidity for us. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, if we failed to comply with the covenants that establish a maximum permitted ratio of total funded debt, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to adjusted EBITDAX, we would be in default, an event that would prevent us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility and would therefore materially limit a significant source of our liquidity. In addition, if we are in default under our revolving credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver of that default from our lenders, lenders under the revolving credit facility and under the indentures governing each series of our outstanding Senior Notes, as defined in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this report, would be entitled to exercise all of their remedies for default.
The following table provides reconciliations of our net income (loss) (GAAP) and net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to adjusted EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods presented:
____________________________________________
(1) Stock-based compensation expense is a component of the exploration expense and general and administrative expense line items on the accompanying statements of operations. Therefore, the exploration line items shown in the reconciliation above will vary from the amount shown on the accompanying statements of operations for the component of stock-based compensation expense recorded to exploration expense.
