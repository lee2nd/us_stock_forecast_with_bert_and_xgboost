Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And
Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
This Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management’s beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “result” and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors, that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. We caution you that while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the factors listed and described at Item 1A “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K discussed above, which investors should review.
Other sections of this report may also include suggested factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in an extremely competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such matters; nor can we assess the impact of all such matters on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8-K or otherwise.
Oil and Gas Properties
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized in cost centers on a country-by-country basis. For each cost center, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, shall not exceed an amount (the cost center ceiling) equal to the sum of:
a) The present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices of oil and natural gas reserves (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of ten percent and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions; plus
b) The cost of properties not being amortized; plus
c) The lower of cost or estimated fair market value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; less
d) Income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties.
If unamortized costs capitalized within a cost center, less related deferred income taxes, exceed the cost center ceiling (as defined), the excess is charged to expense and separately disclosed during the period in which the excess occurs. Amounts required to be written off will not be reinstated for any subsequent increase in the cost center ceiling. All the Company’s oil and gas properties are located within the United States and are accounted for in one cost center.
In order to test the cost center ceiling, the Company prepares a “Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves (Unaudited)” as of the end of each calendar year (“the Reserve Report”). The Company prepared its annual Reserve Report as of December 31, 2020.
Reserve estimates are prepared in accordance with standard Security and Exchange Commission guidelines. The estimated net future net cash flows for 2020, 2019, and 2018, were computed using a 12-month average price, calculated as the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first day-of-the month price for each month of the year. Lease operating costs, compression, dehydration, transportation, ad valorem taxes, severance taxes, and federal income taxes were deducted. Costs and prices were held constant and were not escalated over the life of the properties. No deductions were made for interest. The annual discount of estimated future cash flows is defined, for use herein, as future cash flows discounted at 10% per year, over the expected period of realization.
These Reserve Reports do not purport to present the fair market value of a company's oil and gas properties. An estimate of such value should consider, among other factors, anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas, the probability of recoveries in excess of existing proved reserves, the value of probable reserves and acreage prospects, and perhaps different discount rates.
It should be noted that estimates of reserve quantities, especially from new discoveries, are inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision. Accordingly, the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available. It is reasonably possible that, because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of these reserve estimates, that the estimates of future cash inflows, future gross revenues, the amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the remaining estimated lives of the oil and natural gas properties, or any combination of the above may be increased or reduced in the near term. If reduced, the carrying amount of capitalized oil and gas properties may be reduced materially in the near term.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, average quarterly crude oil prices per bbl for the Company were $45.26, $23.46, $36.48, and $44.94. During the year ended December 31, 2019, average quarterly crude oil prices per bbl for the Company were $48.27, $54.67, $54.84, and $51.42 respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, average quarterly crude oil prices per bbl for the Company were $51.95, $65.00, $57.61, and $52.48 respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, average quarterly natural gas prices per mcf for the Company were $1.26, $1.06, $1.88, and $2.20. During the year ended December 31, 2019, average quarterly natural gas prices per mcf for the Company were $2.64, $2.10, $1.62, and $2.07 respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, average quarterly natural gas prices per mcf for the Company were $3.03, $2.55, $2.74, and $2.93 respectively.
The increases or decreases in the Company’s product prices have a direct effect on its cash flow, profits, projected development and drilling schedules, and the estimated net present value of its proved reserves. Prolonged, substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and could further limit the Company's access to liquidity and credit and could hinder its ability to satisfy its capital requirements.
We may incur impairments to our crude oil and natural gas properties in 2021 if prices do not increase. The possibility and amount of any future impairment is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future crude oil and natural gas prices to be utilized in the ceiling test, estimates of proved reserves and future capital expenditures and operating costs. We cannot assure you that we will not experience write-downs in the future. If commodity prices decline or if any of our proved reserves are revised downward, a write-down of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may be required.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's operating capital needs, as well as its capital spending program, are generally funded from cash flow generated by operations. Because future cash flow is subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production and the sales price of oil and natural gas, the Company can provide no assurance that its operations will provide cash sufficient to maintain current levels of capital spending. Substantial decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and could further limit the Company's access to liquidity and credit and could hinder its ability to satisfy its capital requirements. Accordingly, the Company may be required to seek additional financing from third parties to fund its exploration and development programs.
As noted in our Results of Operations discussion below, the Company has focused on lowering costs through headcount reduction by attrition and spending only on essential general and administrative expenditures. To raise additional revenue, the Company is pursuing the acquisition of new operated and non-operated reserves through acquisitions of producing properties and drilling ventures. The Company believes that it is well positioned to take advantage of the declining prices for existing wells with its cash reserves and ability to borrow to effect any acquisition.
Results of Operations
2020 Compared to 2019
Oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2,924,000 compared to $4,631,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,707,000 or 36.9%.
Oil revenue for 2020 was approximately $1,552,000 compared to $2,726,000 for 2019, a decrease of approximately $1,174,000 or 43.1%. Oil prices decreased to an average of $41.71 per barrel in 2020 from an average of $55.76 per barrel in 2019, a decrease of $14.05 per barrel or 25.2%. Oil sales decreased to 30,900 barrels from approximately 41,919 barrels in 2019, a decrease of 11,019 barrels or 26.29%.
Natural gas revenue for 2020 was approximately $1,372,000 compared to $1,905,000 for 2019, a decrease of approximately $533,000 or 28.0%. Natural gas sales decreased to approximately 743,000 mcf in 2020 from approximately 916,000 mcf in 2019, a decrease of approximately 173,000 mcf or 18.9%. Natural gas prices decreased to an average of $1.84 per mcf in 2020 a decrease of $0.24 or 11.54% from an average of $2.08 per mcf in 2019.
The decrease in oil revenue is due to a decrease in crude oil prices and a decrease in volumes sold during 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in natural gas revenue during 2020 is due to the decrease in natural gas prices received. Natural gas volumes sold decreased during 2020 compared to 2019. A portion of the decrease was due to the Company’s decision to shut-in some of its wells during a period of time when natural gas prices fell to a level which would not cover the operating expenses.
Revenue from lease operations was approximately $233,000 for 2020, compared to approximately $315,000 in 2019, a decrease of approximately $82,000 or 26.0%. Revenue from lease operations results from field supervision charges on operated wells as well as administrative overhead billed to working interest owners.
Revenues from gas gathering, compression, and equipment rental for 2020 were approximately $89,000, a decrease of $36,000 or 28.8% from approximately $125,000 in 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in natural gas volume sold through PPC as wells were shut in due to low natural gas pricing. Equipment rental revenue also decreased as wells were shut in during 2020.
Real estate rental revenue for 2020 was approximately $272,000, an increase of $24,000 or 9.7% from approximately $248,000 in 2019. The increase was due to new office leases signed during the year.
Interest income for 2020 was approximately $216,000, an increase of $23,000 from approximately $193,000 in 2019 or 11.92%. The increase in interest income is due to the Company investing its funds in both long-term and short-term certificates of deposit and depository accounts paying higher rates of interest than those received in money market accounts.
Debt forgiveness income. On May 1, 2020, the Company received funding of a loan pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, enacted March 27, 2020 in the amount of $403,573. In December 2020, the Company received notification that the Small Business Administration has authorized full forgiveness of the PPP loan. The amount of the loan which was fully forgiven is recorded as debt forgiveness income.
Other revenue for 2020 was $42,000, as compared to $75,000 in 2019, a decrease of $33,000 or 44.0%.
Lease operating expenses 2020 were $1,324,000 as compared to $1,754,000 in 2019, a net decrease of approximately $430,000, or 24.5%. There were both increases and decreases within different segment categories of lease operating expenses. Amounts billed by third-party operators as operating expenses on non-operated properties decreased by approximately $65,000. The remaining decrease of $365,000 represents net increases and decreases on various operated properties due to general price fluctuations and levels of operation activity. A number of both operated and non-operated wells were shut-in during 2020 due to low oil and gas prices.
Production taxes, gathering, and marketing expenses for 2020 were approximately $675,000 compared to $828,000 in 2019, a decrease of approximately $153,000, or 18.5%. This decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas production and revenues.
Pipeline and rental expenses for 2020 were $9,000 compared to $32,000 for 2019, a decrease of $23,000, or 71.9%. The decrease is primarily due substantially to non-recurring repair and maintenance expenses in 2019 as compared to 2020.
Real estate expenses in 2020 were approximately $174,000 compared to $179,000 during the same period in 2019, a decrease of approximately $5,000 or 2.8%.
Depreciation and amortization expense for 2020 was $452,000 compared to $456,000 for 2019, a decrease of approximately $4,000 or 0.9%. Amortization of the full cost pool of oil and natural gas assets for 2020 was $393,000 compared to $394,000 for the year ended 2019, a decrease of approximately $1,000 or 0.3%. The Company re-evaluated its proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2020 and decreased its estimated total proved reserves by approximately 352,000 BOE to 630,000 BOE at the end of 2020 compared to 982,000 BOE at the end of 2019, a decrease of approximately 35.9%. Sales of oil and natural gas products during 2020 decreased by approximately 40,000 BOE from approximately 195,000 BOE in 2019 to approximately 155,000 BOE in 2020, a decrease of 20.5 %. (See Footnote 18 to the Financial Statements). This resulted in an increase in the depletion rate factor from 16.543% in 2019 on an unamortized full cost pool base of $2,381,000 to a depletion rate factor of 19.722% on an unamortized full cost pool base of $1,994,000 in 2020. The net decrease in the unamortized full cost pool base of $388,000 is due mainly to a depletion charge of $394,000 from 2019.
Asset Retirement Obligation (“ARO”) accretion expense for 2020 was $139,000 up from $120,000 in 2019, an increase of $19,000 or 15.8%. The ARO calculation is based on the Company’s annual reserve report and takes into consideration the changes between years of the Company’s estimated obligation to plug its interests in existing wells. This estimated future cost is discounted using a 10% discount factor based on the estimated life of each property. Changes are incorporated as applicable into the full cost pool and the carrying value of the liability. Accretion expense measures and incorporates changes due to the passage of time into the carrying amount of the liability.
General and administrative expenses for 2020 were approximately $2,640,000 as compared to approximately $2,967,000 for 2019, a decrease of approximately $327,000 or 11.0%. The decrease is from reduced salary, wages, other personnel costs, and reduced office, computer and other expenses.
2019 Compared to 2018
Oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $4,631,000 compared to $5,848,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,217,000 or 20.8%.
Oil revenue for 2019 was approximately $2,726,000 compared to $3,350,000 for 2018, a decrease of approximately $624,000 or 18.6%. Oil prices decreased to an average of $55.76 per barrel in 2019 from an average of $62.09 per barrel in 2018, a decrease of $6.33 per barrel or 10.2%. Oil sales decreased to 41,919 barrels from approximately 43,136 barrels in 2018, a decrease of 1,217 barrels or 2.8%.
Natural gas revenue for 2019 was approximately $1,905,000 compared to $2,498,000 for 2018, a decrease of approximately $593,000 or 23.7%. Natural gas sales increased to approximately 916,000 mcf in 2019 from approximately 875,000 mcf in 2018, an increase of approximately 41,000 mcf or 4.7%. Natural gas prices decreased to an average of $2.08 per mcf in 2019, a decrease of $0.78 or 27.3% from an average of $2.86 per mcf in 2018.
The decrease in oil revenue is due to a decrease in crude oil prices and a decrease in volumes sold during 2019 compared to 2018. Oil production from operated properties increased slightly during 2019 but decreases in oil production on non- operated properties contributed to the overall production decrease. The decrease in natural gas revenue during 2019 is due to the decrease in natural gas pricing. Natural gas volumes sold increased during 2019 compared to 2018; however, the 27% decrease in pricing resulted in an overall decrease in natural gas revenue.
Revenue from lease operations was approximately $315,000 for 2019, compared to approximately $258,000 in 2018, an increase of approximately $57,000 or 22.1%. Revenue from lease operations results from field supervision charges on operated wells as well as administrative overhead billed to working interest owners.
Revenues from gas gathering, compression, and equipment rental for 2019 were approximately $125,000, a decrease of $11,000 or 8.1% from approximately $136,000 in 2018. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in natural gas volume sold through PPC as wells were shut in due to low natural gas pricing. Equipment rental revenue also decreased as wells were shut in during 2019.
Real estate rental revenue for 2019 was approximately $248,000, an increase of $16,000 or 6.9% from approximately $232,000 in 2018. The increase was due to scheduled tenant rent increases at the Company’s corporate office building.
Interest income for 2019 was approximately $193,000, an increase of $12,000 from approximately $181,000 in 2018 or 6.6%. The increase in interest income was due to the Company investing its funds in both long-term and short-term certificates of deposit and depository accounts paying higher rates of interest than those received in prior years.
Other revenue for 2019 was $75,000, as compared to $79,000 in 2018, a decrease of $4,000 or 5.1%.
Lease operating expenses 2019 were $1,754,000 as compared to $1,656,000 in 2018, a net increase of approximately $98,000, or 5.9%. There were both increases and decreases within different segment categories of lease operating expenses. Amounts billed by third-party operators as operating expenses on non-operated properties increased by approximately $77,000 due to large workovers and unitization expenses. The remaining increase of $21,000 represents net increases and decreases on various properties due to general price fluctuations and levels of operation activity.
Production taxes, gathering, and marketing expenses for 2019 were approximately $828,000 compared to $835,000 in 2018, a decrease of approximately $7,000, or 0.8%. This decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas production and revenues.
Pipeline and rental expenses for 2019 were $32,000 compared to $49,000 for 2018, a decrease of $17,000, or 34.7%. The decrease is primarily due to substantially lower levels of compressor repairs in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Real estate expenses in 2019 were approximately $179,000 compared to $196,000 during the same period in 2018, a decrease of approximately $17,000 or 8.7%. The decrease is primarily due to lower property taxes and utilities in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expense for 2019 was $456,000 compared to $499,000 for 2018, a decrease of $43,000 or 8.6%. Amortization of the full cost pool of oil and natural gas assets for 2019 was $394,000 compared to $439,000 for the year ended 2018, a decrease of $45,000 or 10.3%. The Company re-evaluated its proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2019 and decreased its estimated total proved reserves by approximately 421,000 BOE to 982,000 BOE at the end of 2019 compared to 1,403,000 BOE at the end of 2018, a decrease of approximately 30.0%. Sales of oil and natural gas products during 2019 increased by approximately 6,000 BOE from approximately 195,000 BOE in 2019 to approximately 189,000 BOE in 2018, an increase of 3.2 %. (See Footnote 18 to the Financial Statements). This resulted in an increase in the depletion rate factor from 11.868% in 2018 on an unamortized full cost pool base of $3,700,000 to a depletion rate factor of 16.543% on an unamortized full cost pool base of $2,382,000 in 2019. The net decrease in the unamortized full cost pool base of $1,318,000 was due in part to accumulated depletion of $439,000 from 2018. In addition, $918,000 of proceeds from sales of properties was credited to the full cost pool in accordance with GAAP.
Asset Retirement Obligation (“ARO”) accretion expense for 2019 was $120,000 down from $189,000 in 2018, a decrease of $69,000 or 36.5%. The ARO calculation is based on the Company’s annual reserve report and takes into consideration the changes between years of the Company’s estimated obligation to plug its interests in existing wells. This estimated future cost is discounted using a 10% discount factor based on the estimated life of each property. Changes are incorporated as applicable into the full cost pool and the carrying value of the liability. Accretion expense measures and incorporates changes due to the passage of time into the carrying amount of the liability.
General and administrative expenses for 2019 were approximately $2,967,000 as compared to approximately $2,943,000 for 2018, an increase of approximately $24,000 or 0.8%.
