ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Since April 2016, the Company has been engaged in the identification of suitable opportunities for a business transaction. As per Note 8 below, the Company has entered into a non-binding letter of intent with CBD Brand Partners. Pursuant to the letter of intent, the Company filed a proxy statement to allow it to take the steps required to complete the transaction contemplated. Specifically, the Company amended and restated its articles of incorporation and created three (3) series of preferred stock. We will not engage in any substantive commercial business activities unless and until we consummate a business transaction, which may never occur.
Our management has broad discretion with respect to identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. There are numerous risks in connection with our current and proposed business plans, including that any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential growth companies. In addition, we may affect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
We expect that in connection with any business transaction, we will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock (equal to at least 80% of the total number of shares outstanding after giving effect to the transaction and likely, a significantly higher percentage), in order to ensure that such transaction qualifies as a “tax free” transaction under federal tax laws). The issuance of additional shares of our capital stock will significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders as of the date of the transaction and will likely result in the resignation or removal of our management as of the date of the transaction.
Our management anticipates that the Company likely will be able to affect only one business transaction, due primarily to our financial resources and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will concentrate the chance for our success into a single business and not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against potential gains from another.
Management anticipates that the selection of a target business and the consummation of a business transaction will be complex and extremely risky and cannot assure investors that the Company ever will enter into such a transaction or that if we do consummate of a business transaction that the Company will achieve long-term or immediate short-term earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020 the Company current assets of $450,711 and total assets of $3,193,657. As of December 31, 2019 the Company current assets of $1,045 and total assets of $1,045.

The Company has funded its operations from contributions made by management. The Company has no present sources of capital or liquidity.
At present, the Company has no business operations and no cash resources other than as are provided by management. We are dependent upon interim funding provided by management to pay professional fees and expenses. Our management has agreed to provide funding as may be required to pay for professional fees and other administrative expenses of the Company until the Company enters into a business transaction. The Company would be unable to continue as a going concern without interim financing provided by management. If we require additional financing, we cannot predict whether equity or debt financing will become available at terms acceptable to us, if at all. The Company depends upon services provided by management to fulfill its filing obligations under the Exchange Act. At present, the Company has no financial resources to pay for such services and may be required to issue restricted shares in lieu of cash or, in the alternative, issue debt instruments evidencing financial obligations if and when they arise. Any funds advanced by management will be advanced as loans that will bear interest at the rate of 8% per year and which shall mature on the closing of a business transaction.
Over the next twelve months, we expect to incur costs and expenses related to:
·
maintaining our corporate existence, such as annual fees due to the State of Nevada;
·
filing periodic reports under the Exchange Act including filing accounting and legal fees;
·
investigating and analyzing targets and possibly consummating a business transaction.
These costs are difficult to quantify given the multitude of variables associated with such activities. Our ongoing expenses will result in continued net operating losses that will increase until we can consummate a business transaction with a profitable target business, if ever. We estimate that these costs will be in the range of to six to eight thousand dollars per year, and that we will be able to meet these costs as necessary, to be advanced to us by management.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
Going Concern
Our lack of revenues, continuing operating losses and lack of operating capital create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain capital from our affiliates to fund our operations, generate cash from the sale of its securities and attain future profitable operations. Management’s plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund its capital requirement and ongoing operations; however, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Contractual Obligations
As a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.
