All references to “Hess Midstream LP,” “the Company,” “us,” “our,” “we” or similar terms, when referring to periods subsequent to December 16, 2019, refer to Hess Midstream LP, including its consolidated subsidiaries.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented, limited partnership formed by Hess Infrastructure Partners GP LLC (“HIP GP LLC”) and our general partner to own, operate, develop and acquire a diverse set of midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers. We are managed and controlled by Hess Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of our general partner. Our assets are primarily located in the Bakken and Three Forks shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota, which we collectively refer to as the Bakken.
On January 25, 2018, we entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. (“Targa”) to construct a new 200 MMcf/d gas processing plant called Little Missouri 4 (“LM4”). LM4 was placed in service in the third quarter of 2019. Targa is the operator of the plant.
On March 1, 2019, Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (“HIP”) acquired 100% of the membership interest in Hess’ Bakken water services business (“Hess Water Services”) for cash consideration of $225.0 million.
On March 22, 2019, we acquired the crude oil, gas and water gathering assets of Summit Midstream Partners’ Tioga Gathering System for cash consideration of $89.2 million, with the potential for additional contingent payments in future periods subject to certain future performance metrics. As of December 31, 2020, the contingent liability was $7.0 million.
On April 25, 2019, we announced plans to expand natural gas processing capacity at the Tioga Gas Plant by 150 MMcf/d for total processing capacity of 400 MMcf/d. As of December 31, 2020, the facility construction is complete. Incremental gas processing capacity is expected to be available in 2021 upon completion of a scheduled plant maintenance turnaround in the third quarter, during which the expansion and residue and NGL takeaway pipelines will be tied into the Tioga Gas Plant.
On December 16, 2019, the Company and the Partnership completed the transactions (the “Restructuring”) contemplated by the Partnership Restructuring Agreement, dated October 3, 2019, by and among the Company, the Partnership and the other parties thereto. As a result of the Restructuring, the Company was delegated control of the Partnership and replaced the Partnership as its publicly traded successor. Prior to the Restructuring, the Company and the Partnership were indirectly controlled by HIP GP LLC, the general partner of HIP. HIP was originally formed as a joint venture between Hess and GIP (together, the “Sponsors”) and owned an 80% economic interest in certain of the Partnership’s existing assets (the “Joint Interest Assets”), a 100% interest in certain other businesses, including Hess Water Services and a 100% interest in Hess Midstream Partners GP LP (“MLP GP LP”), which held all of the Partnership’s outstanding incentive distribution rights and the general partner interest in the Partnership, and controlled the Partnership.
Pursuant to the Restructuring, the Partnership acquired HIP, including HIP’s 80% interest in the Joint Interest Assets, 100% interest in Hess Water Services and the outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in the Partnership. The Partnership’s organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an “Up-C” structure in which the Partnership’s public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares (“Class A Shares”) in Hess Midstream LP in a one-for-one exchange. The Partnership changed its name to “Hess Midstream Operations LP” and became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. After consummation of the Restructuring, the Sponsors and their affiliates received an aggregate of 898,000 Class A Shares in the Company, 266,416,928 Class B units representing noncontrolling limited partner interests in the Partnership and received aggregate cash consideration of $601.8 million. The Sponsors own 100% interest in the general partner of the Company and, through their ownership of the general partner, continue to have the right to elect the entire board of directors.
The acquisition of HIP by the Partnership, including its 80% economic interest in the Joint Interest Assets and 100% interest in Hess Water Services, was accounted for as an acquisition of a business under common control. Accordingly, our results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are presented as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period.
Our principal business objective is to grow our business and distributable cash flow supported by fee-based contracts and disciplined financial strategy. We expect to achieve this objective through the following business strategies:
•
Focus on Cash Flow Stability and Growth Supported by Long-Term, Fee-Based Contracts and a Disciplined Financial Strategy. We seek to grow our distributable cash flow to be able to fund our expansion capital and growing distributions while maintaining balance sheet strength. Our commercial agreements include dedications covering substantially all of Hess’ existing and future owned or controlled production in the Bakken, minimum volume commitments, inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, all of which are intended to provide us with cash flow stability and downside risk protection.
•
Capitalize on Hess’ Bakken Production Growth. Our midstream infrastructure footprint services Hess’ leading acreage position in the Bakken. We believe our volumes and investment opportunities will continue to expand as Hess drills new wells in the Bakken. We intend to invest additional capital to continue extending and expanding our strategically positioned infrastructure, including additional gas capture capabilities, to meet Hess’ current and future production growth and enable Hess to continue to meet or exceed North Dakota’s well head gas capture targets.
•
Leverage Core Asset Base to Attract Additional Third-Party Business. We currently handle volumes from third-party producers and midstream companies under our commercial agreements with Hess, and we are pursuing both additional projects and strategic relationships with third-party customers with operations in the Bakken in order to maximize our utilization rates.
•
Grow Through Accretive Acquisitions from Our Sponsors and Third Parties. We plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary midstream assets from our Sponsors as well as from third parties.
Our assets and operations are organized into the following three reportable segments: (i) gathering, (ii) processing and storage and (iii) terminaling and export.
Gathering
Our gathering segment includes Hess North Dakota Pipeline Operations LP, or Gathering Opco, and Hess Water Services Holdings LLC, which own the following assets:
•
Natural Gas Gathering and Compression. A natural gas gathering and compression system located primarily in McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota connecting Hess and third-party owned or operated wells to the Tioga Gas Plant, Little Missouri 4 gas processing plant and third-party pipeline facilities. The system also includes the Hawkeye Gas Facility.
•
Crude Oil Gathering. A crude oil gathering system located primarily in McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota, connecting Hess and third-party owned or operated wells to the Ramberg Terminal Facility, the Tioga Rail Terminal and the Johnson’s Corner Header System. The system also includes the Hawkeye Oil Facility.
•
Produced Water Gathering and Disposal. A produced water gathering system and disposal facilities located primarily in Williams and Mountrail counties, North Dakota.
Processing and Storage
Our processing and storage segment includes Hess TGP Operations LP, or HTGP Opco, and Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC, or Mentor Holdings, which own the following assets, respectively:
•
Tioga Gas Plant (“TGP”). A natural gas processing and fractionation plant located in Tioga, North Dakota.
•
Equity Investment in Little Missouri 4 (“LM4”) Joint Venture. A 50% equity method investment in LM4 joint venture that owns a natural gas processing plant located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, that was placed in service in the third quarter of 2019.
•
Mentor Storage Terminal. A propane storage cavern and rail and truck loading and unloading facility located in Mentor, Minnesota.
Terminaling and Export
Our terminaling and export segment includes Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP, or Logistics Opco, which owns each of the following assets:
•
Ramberg Terminal Facility. A crude oil pipeline and truck receipt terminal located in Williams County, North Dakota that is capable of delivering crude oil into an interconnecting pipeline for transportation to the Tioga Rail Terminal and to multiple third-party pipelines and storage facilities.
•
Tioga Rail Terminal. A crude oil and NGL rail loading terminal in Tioga, North Dakota that is connected to the Tioga Gas Plant, the Ramberg Terminal Facility and our crude oil gathering system.
•
Crude Oil Rail Cars. A total of 550 crude oil rail cars, constructed to DOT-117 safety standards, which we operate as unit trains consisting of approximately 100 to 110 crude oil rail cars.
•
Johnson’s Corner Header System. An approximately six-mile crude oil pipeline header system located in McKenzie County, North Dakota that receives crude oil by pipeline from Hess and third parties and delivers crude oil to third-party interstate pipeline systems.
Our Ongoing Response to Global Pandemic and Market Conditions
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic continues to have a profound impact on society and industry. The Company’s first priority in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the health and safety of the Company’s workforce and local communities. A multidisciplinary emergency response team has been established in coordination with Hess that has been overseeing plans and precautions to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in the work environment while maintaining business continuity based on the most current recommendations by government and public health agencies. The Company and Hess have implemented a variety of health and safety measures including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices such as travel restrictions, health screenings, reduced personnel at work sites wherever this can be done safely, and remote working arrangements for office workers.
In addition to the global health concerns of COVID-19, the pandemic has severely impacted demand for oil. In response to the resulting sharp decline in oil prices, Hess reduced its rig count in the Bakken from 6 rigs to 1 rig during the second quarter of 2020. In addition, third parties in the Bakken also curtailed production and reduced drilling activity. Our contract structure has largely offset and is expected to continue to offset the impact of the reduction in volumes on our financial performance metrics through the Initial Term of our commercial agreements, as our minimum volume commitments provide minimum levels of cash flows and the fee recalculation mechanisms under our agreements support our cash flow stability. See “Other Factors Expected to Significantly Affect Our Future Results.”
Consistent with Hess’ reduced activity and our focus on preserving balance sheet strength, we reduced our 2020 expansion capital program, primarily due to fewer well connects and the deferral or cancellation of certain gas compression activities. In order to preserve long-term sustainability and financial strength, in 2020 we also lowered our targeted annualized distribution growth rate per share from 15% to 5%. We also deferred the planned maintenance turnaround at TGP originally scheduled for the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 to ensure safe and timely execution in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Significant 2020 Financial and Operating Results
Significant financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 include:
•
Implemented COVID-19 plans and precautions to protect the health and safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate and maintain business continuity.

•
Throughput volumes increased across all segments, compared with the prior year, including 18% for gas processing and 11% for crude oil terminaling, driven by higher Hess production and increased gas capture by Hess Midstream LP.
For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see “How We Evaluate Our Operations” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
How We Generate Revenues
We generate substantially all of our revenues by charging fees for gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGLs; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; storing and terminaling propane; and gathering and disposing of produced water. We have entered into long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Hess dated effective January 1, 2014, for oil and gas services agreements, and effective January 1, 2019, for water services agreements. In addition, in 2018, Hess Water Services had documented intercompany arrangements with a subsidiary of Hess pursuant to which it provided produced water gathering and disposal services and charged agreed-upon fees per barrel for the services performed.
Except for the water services agreements and except for a certain gathering sub-system, as described below, each of our commercial agreements with Hess has an initial 10-year term and we have the unilateral right to renew each of these agreements for one additional 10-year term. In September 2018, we amended our gas gathering and gas processing and fractionation agreements to enable us to provide certain services to Hess in respect of volumes to be delivered to and processed at the LM4 plant. The amended and restated gas gathering agreement also extends the initial term of the gathering agreement with respect to a certain gathering sub-system by 5 years to provide for a 15-year initial term and decreases the secondary term for that gathering sub-system by 5 years to provide for a 5-year secondary term. Initial term for the water services agreements is 14 years and the secondary term is 10 years. On December 30, 2020, we exercised our renewal options to extend the terms of certain crude oil gathering, terminaling, storage, gas processing and gas gathering commercial agreements with Hess for the Secondary Term through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options. For the remaining water gathering and disposal agreements as well as the remaining gas gathering agreement, we have the sole option to renew these agreements for an additional term that is exercisable at a later date.
These agreements include dedications covering substantially all of Hess’ existing and future owned or controlled production in the Bakken, minimum volume commitments, inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, all of which are intended to provide us with cash flow stability and growth, as well as downside risk protection. In particular, Hess’ minimum volume commitments under our commercial agreements provide minimum levels of cash flows and the fee recalculation mechanisms under the agreements allow fees to be adjusted annually to provide us with cash flow stability during the initial term of the agreements. During the secondary term of the agreements, the fee recalculation model will be replaced by an inflation-based fee structure. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note 4, Related Party Transactions for additional description of our commercial agreements.
Our revenues also include revenues from third-party volumes contracted with Hess and delivered to us under these commercial agreements with Hess, as well as pass-through third-party rail transportation costs, third-party produced water trucking and disposal costs and electricity fees for which we recognize revenues in an amount equal to the costs. Together with Hess, we are pursuing strategic relationships with third-party producers and other midstream companies with operations in the Bakken in order to maximize our utilization rates.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our operating results and profitability. These metrics include (i) volumes, (ii) operating and maintenance expenses, (iii) Adjusted EBITDA, and (iv) distributable cash flow.
Volumes. The amount of revenues we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and produced water that we handle at our gathering, processing, terminaling, storage and disposal facilities. These volumes are affected primarily by the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets, including changes in crude oil prices, which may further affect volumes delivered by Hess. Although Hess has committed to minimum volumes under our commercial agreements described above, our results of operations will be impacted by our ability to:
•
utilize the remaining uncommitted capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our existing assets, and optimize our existing assets;
•
identify and execute expansion projects, and capture incremental throughput volumes from Hess and third parties for these expanded facilities;
•
increase throughput volumes at our Ramberg Terminal Facility, Tioga Rail Terminal and the Johnson’s Corner Header System by interconnecting with new or existing third-party gathering pipelines; and
•
increase gas processing throughput volumes by interconnecting with new or existing third-party gathering pipelines.
Operating and Maintenance Expenses. Our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses are comprised primarily of costs charged to us under our omnibus agreement and employee secondment agreement, third-party contractor costs, utility costs, insurance premiums, third-party service provider costs, related property taxes and other non-income taxes and maintenance expenses, such as expenditures to repair, refurbish and replace storage facilities and to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of substantial expenses, such as gas plant turnarounds. We seek to manage our maintenance expenditures by scheduling periodic maintenance on our assets in order to minimize significant variability in these expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow.
Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization and our proportional share of depreciation of our equity affiliates, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, such as transaction costs, other income and other non-cash, non-recurring items, if applicable. We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less net interest, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, cash paid for federal and state income taxes and maintenance capital expenditures. Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. We use Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to analyze our performance and liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:
•
our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;
•
the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our shareholders;
•
our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
•
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.
We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
Results of Operations
The following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The results of operations are discussed in further detail following this overview (in millions, unless otherwise noted).
Year ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Gathering
Revenues increased $139.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019, of which $56.1 million is attributable to higher gas gathering and compression volumes and $16.1 million is attributable to higher crude oil gathering volumes driven by higher Hess production, higher gas capture and increasing minimum volume commitment levels. In addition, $44.8 million of the increase in revenues is attributable to higher tariff rates, $17.1 million is attributable to higher operated water services revenue and $4.9 million is attributable to higher pass-through electricity fees and produced water trucking and disposal revenue.
Operating and maintenance expenses increased $12.0 million, of which $4.9 million is attributable to higher pass-through electricity and produced water pass-through trucking and disposal fees, $4.6 million is attributable to higher maintenance costs on our expanded infrastructure, and $2.5 million is attributable to higher insurance and property taxes due to additional assets placed in service. Depreciation expense increased $14.4 million due to new compressors, produced water disposal facilities and other new gathering assets being brought into service, as well as due to gathering assets acquired from Summit Midstream Partners, LP at the end of the first quarter of 2019. General and administrative expenses decreased $2.0 million primarily attributable to lower charges from Hess under our omnibus and employee secondment agreements.
Processing and Storage
Revenues and other income increased $75.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019, of which $46.2 million is attributable to higher volumes driven by higher Hess production, higher gas capture and LM4 being in service for the full year in 2020. Additionally, $28.0 million of the increase in revenues is attributable to higher tariff rates and $1.1 million is attributable to higher pass-through electricity fees. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $37.8 million, of which $19.3 million is attributable to LM4 processing fees, $8.8 million is attributable to higher employee costs allocated to us under our omnibus and employee secondment agreements, $7.1 million is attributable to higher maintenance activity due to TGP turnaround, $1.5 million is attributable to higher insurance and property tax and $1.1 million is attributable to higher pass-through electricity fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.7 million is primarily attributable to higher charges from Hess under our omnibus and employee secondment agreements.
Terminaling and Export
Revenues and other income increased $29.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019, of which $10.5 million is attributable to higher rail transportation pass-through revenues. In addition, $9.9 million of the increase is attributable to higher tariff rates and $8.9 million of the increase is attributable to higher throughput volumes at our terminals driven by higher Hess production and increasing minimum volume commitment levels. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $10.8 million primarily attributable to higher rail transportation pass-through cost.
Interest and Other
General and administrative expenses decreased $30.9 million, primarily due to costs associated with the Restructuring. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased $32.3 million primarily attributable to the $550 million 5.125% fixed-rate senior notes issued in connection with the Restructuring and higher borrowings under our credit facilities. Income tax expense increased $7.4 million as a result of being a separate taxable entity for the full year in 2020.
Year ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Gathering
Revenues increased $47.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018, of which $21.2 million is attributable to higher third-party produced water trucking and disposal pass-through revenues and $3.9 million is attributable to pass-through electricity fees. In addition, $6.1 million of the increase is attributable to higher gas gathering and compression volumes, $5.8 million is attributable to higher water gathering volumes and $5.4 million is attributable to higher crude oil gathering volumes relative to 2018 minimum volume commitment levels driven by growing Hess production and additional third-party volumes contracted with Hess and delivered to us. The remaining $5.3 million of the increase in revenues is attributable to higher tariff rates. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $41.9 million, of which $21.2 million is attributable to higher third-party produced water trucking and disposal pass-through costs driven by growing Hess production, $14.1 million is attributable to higher maintenance activity on our expanded infrastructure, $3.9 million is attributable to pass-through electricity costs due to additional compressors coming online, and $2.7 million is attributable to higher property taxes due to additional assets acquired and placed into service. Depreciation expense increased $14.4 million due to gathering assets acquired from Summit Midstream Partners, LP at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and other new assets being brought into service. General and administrative expenses increased $5.0 million primarily attributable to higher charges from Hess under our omnibus and employee secondment agreements.
Processing and Storage
Revenues and other income increased $43.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, of which $27.0 million is attributable to higher volumes, driven by LM4 ramp-up, which was placed into service in the third quarter of 2019, and continued backfilling of TGP with third-party volumes contracted with Hess and delivered to us. In addition, $15.2 million of the increase is attributable to higher tariff rates. The remaining $1.1 million of the increase in revenues is attributable to higher pass-through electricity fees and $0.6 million other income. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $17.0 million, of which $9.6 million is attributable to higher maintenance activity, including initial work on the TGP turnaround, which was initially planned for 2020, $6.3 million is attributable to LM4 processing fees and $1.1 million is attributable to pass-through electricity costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $2.2 million is primarily attributable to higher charges from Hess under our omnibus and employee secondment agreements.
Terminaling and Export
Revenues and other income increased $44.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018, of which $23.4 million is attributable to higher rail transportation pass-through revenues. In addition, $10.5 million of the increase is attributable to higher tariff rates and $10.1 million is attributable to higher crude oil throughput volumes at our terminals, driven by growing Hess production and increased third-party volumes contracted with Hess and delivered to us. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $24.4 million primarily attributable to higher rail transportation pass-through costs.
Interest and Other
General and administrative expenses increased $30.6 million, of which $26.2 million is attributable to transaction costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the Restructuring and $4.4 million of the increase is attributable to higher other professional fees. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased $9.1 million primarily driven by borrowings on HIP revolving credit facility prior to the Restructuring and additional interest expense on newly issued $550 million of 5.125% fixed-rate senior notes.
Other Factors Expected to Significantly Affect Our Future Results
We currently generate substantially all of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Hess, including third parties contracted with affiliates of Hess. These contracts provide cash flow stability and minimize our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations, since we generally do not own any of the crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs that we handle and do not engage in the trading of crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs. However, commodity price fluctuations indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term, since they can affect production rates and investments by Hess and third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. The markets for oil and natural gas are volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. In the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the sharp decline in crude oil prices, Hess reduced its rig count from 6 rigs to 1 rig in the Bakken. In addition, third parties in the Bakken also curtailed production and reduced their drilling activities. Our contract structure has largely offset and is expected to continue to offset potential impact of the reduction in volumes on our financial performance metrics through the initial term of our commercial agreements, as our minimum volume commitments provide minimum levels of cash flows and the fee recalculation mechanisms under our agreements support our cash flow stability. While the second term of our commercial agreements includes continuing minimum volume commitments, the fees change to an inflation-based fixed fee structure, which may provide greater exposure to price volatility. To the extent our plans include revenues for volumes, including third-party volumes contracted through Hess, above currently established minimum volume commitment levels, such revenues could decline to the minimum volume commitment levels as a result of market volatility. Hess announced that in 2021 it plans to add an additional rig in the Bakken and we expect to be above minimum volume commitment levels in 2023.
The throughput volumes at our facilities depend primarily on the volumes of crude oil and natural gas produced by Hess in the Bakken, which, in turn, is ultimately dependent on Hess’ exploration and production margins. Exploration and production margins depend on the price of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. These prices are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our or Hess’ control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. During the first quarter of 2020, worldwide crude oil prices declined significantly due in part to reduced global demand stemming from the COVID-19 global pandemic. Sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas could materially and adversely affect the quantities of oil and natural gas that Hess can economically produce. The commodities trading markets, as well as global and regional supply and demand factors, may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Furthermore, our ability to execute our growth strategy in the Bakken, including attracting third-party volumes, will depend on crude oil and natural gas production in that area, which is also affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.
(1)
Represents cash interest paid, net, attributable to controlling interest prior to the Restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash interest paid was largely offset by interest received.
(2)
Distributable cash flow prior to the Restructuring is calculated net of any amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest. Distributable cash flow prior to the Restructuring for 2019 represents a period of nine months ended September 30, 2019, during which distributions were paid under the old structure. Subsequent to the Restructuring, we make cash distributions to holders of Class A Shares, including to our general partner as holder of an aggregate of 898,000 Class A Shares, and the Partnership makes cash distributions to holders of units of the Partnership, including to the Sponsors as holders of an aggregate of 266,416,928 Class B Units, pro rata. Therefore, distributable cash flow subsequent to the Restructuring includes amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest. Distributable cash flow subsequent to the Restructuring for 2019 represents a period of three months ended December 31, 2019.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include:
•
cash on hand;
•
cash generated from operations;
•
borrowings under our revolving credit facility;
•
issuances of additional debt securities; and
•
issuances of additional equity securities.
We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, our planned capital expenditures, debt service requirements, our quarterly cash distribution requirements, future internal growth projects or potential acquisitions.
Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made distributions of $31.6 million, to the holders of our equity securities representing limited partner interests in us. In addition, the Partnership made distributions of $462.1 million to the Sponsors as holders of an aggregate of 266,416,928 Class B Units of the Partnership. On January 25, 2021, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4471 per Class A Share that was paid on February 12, 2021 to shareholders of record on February 4, 2021, and the Partnership made distributions of $0.4471 per Class B Unit of the Partnership to the Sponsors.
Fixed-Rate Senior Notes
In December 2019, in connection with the Restructuring, the Partnership, assumed $800.0 million of 5.625% outstanding fixed-rate senior notes of HIP in a par-for-par exchange for newly issued 5.625% senior notes due 2026 of the Partnership and paid approximately $2.0 million of exchange consent fees. The notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Partnership. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15.
In December 2019, the Partnership issued $550.0 million of 5.125% fixed-rate senior notes due 2028 to qualified institutional investors. The notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Partnership. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. The Partnership used the net proceeds to finance the acquisition of HIP, including to repay borrowings under HIP’s credit facilities, and pay related fees and expenses.
Each of the indentures for the 2026 and 2028 senior notes contains customary covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any other restricted payments; (ii) transfer or sell assets or subsidiary stock; (iii) incur additional debt; or (iv) make restricted investments, unless, at the time of and immediately after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payments and any related incurrence of indebtedness or other transactions, no default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such restricted payment and if the leverage ratio does not exceed 4.25 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the indentures.
In addition, the covenants included in the indentures governing the senior notes contain provisions that allow the Company to satisfy the Partnership’s reporting obligations under the indenture, as long as any such financial information of the Company contains information reasonably sufficient to identify the material differences, if any, between the financial information of the Company, on the one hand, and the Partnership and its subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand and the Company does not directly own capital stock of any person other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries, or material business operations that would not be consolidated with the financial results of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Company is a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Other than the interest in the Partnership and the effect of federal and state income taxes that are recognized at the Company level, there are no material differences between the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Credit Facilities
In December 2019, the Partnership entered into senior secured syndicated credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”) consisting of a $1,000.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400.0 million 5-year Term Loan A facility. Facility fees accrue on the total capacity of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest rate margins are based on the Partnership’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities). If the Partnership obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on the Partnership’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. At December 31, 2020, borrowings of $184.0 million were drawn under the Partnership’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400.0 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under the Partnership’s Term Loan A facility.
The Credit Facilities can be used for borrowings and letters of credit for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by each direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiary of the Partnership, and are secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all of the presently owned and after-acquired assets of the Partnership and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. The Credit Facilities contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that the Partnership considers to be customary for an agreement of this type, including a covenant that requires the Partnership to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to the Partnership obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership was in compliance with these financial covenants.
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows (in millions):
Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $171.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The change in operating cash flows resulted from an increase in revenues and other income of $243.6 million and distributions from equity investments of $9.7 million, offset by an increase in expenses, other than depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation and other non-cash gains and losses of $55.7 million and a decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital of $26.6 million.
Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $3.8 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The change in operating cash flows resulted from an increase in revenues and other income of $135.6 million and an increase in cash provided by changes in working capital of $2.7 million, offset by an increase in expenses, other than depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation and other non-cash gains and losses of $134.5 million.
Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased $196.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in investing cash outflows resulted from the acquisition of Summit Midstream Partners’ Tioga Gathering System in 2019 for $89.2 million, net of cash acquired, the acquisition of Hess Water Services in 2019 for $225 million, of which $68.9 million was included in cash outflows from investing activities, lower payments for our investment in LM4 of $33.0 million, lower payments for capital expenditures of $5.3 million, and proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment of $0.1 million.
Cash flows used in investing activities increased $189.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in investing cash outflows resulted from the acquisition of Summit Midstream Partners’ Tioga Gathering System of $89.2 million, net of cash acquired, the acquisition of $68.9 million of net assets in connection with the Hess Water Services acquisition, an increase in payments for capital expenditures of $64.5 million and a decrease in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment of $1.6 million. These cash outflows were offset by a decrease in our payments for our equity investment in LM4 of $34.3 million.
Financing Activities. Cash flows used in financing activities increased $262.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decrease in borrowings of $613.4 million and an increase in distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest of $408.3 million. The remaining change resulted from payments of cash consideration related to the Restructuring of $601.8 million and acquisition of Hess Water Services for $225 million, as described above, of which $156.1 million was included in the cash outflows from financing activities as a distribution to Hess in 2019, partially offset by the final settlement amount of $1.6 million received from Hess in 2020.
Cash flows used in financing activities decreased $326.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of increased net borrowings of $767.6 million, net of any changes in financing costs, a decrease in distributions to Hess, GIP and our limited partners and other distributions of $160.7 million, offset by cash consideration paid related to the Restructuring of $601.8 million.
Capital Expenditures
Our operations can be capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, upgrade, maintain or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our partnership agreement requires that we distinguish between maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to maintain, over the long term, our operating capacity, operating income or revenue. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to repair, refurbish or replace existing assets, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. In contrast, expansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating capacity, operating income or revenue over the long term. Examples of expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of equipment, construction, development or acquisition of additional capacity, or expenditures for connecting additional wells to our gathering systems, to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to expand our long-term operating capacity, operating income or revenue.
The following table sets forth a summary of maintenance and expansion capital expenditures and reconciles capital expenditures on an accrual basis to additions to property, plant and equipment on a cash basis:
In 2020, we completed construction and preservation activities for the 150 MMcf/d expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant. Capital expenditures in 2020 also relate to continued expansion of our compression capacity and gas capture capabilities to meet Hess’ and third parties’ current and future production growth and enable Hess to continue to meet or exceed North Dakota’s well head gas capture targets. Capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 are primarily attributable to continued expansion of our gathering and compression capacity, as well as amounts attributable to engineering, procurement, civil construction and fabrication activities for the Tioga Gas Plant expansion that began in 2019. Additionally, in 2019, we acquired Hess Water Services for cash consideration of $225.0 million, of which $68.9 million was recognized as additions to property, plant, and equipment and $156.1 million was recognized as a distribution to Hess. In 2019, we also acquired Summit Midstream Partners’ Tioga Gathering System for cash consideration of $89.2 million, with the potential for additional payments in future periods subject to certain future performance metrics. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note 3, Acquisitions.
Contractual Obligations
A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. The accounting methods used can affect net income, partners’ capital and various financial statement ratios. However, the accounting methods generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation, subject to the results of impairment testing. We capitalize all construction-related direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect construction costs. Indirect construction costs include general engineering, taxes and the cost of funds used during construction of material projects. Costs, including complete asset replacements and enhancements or upgrades that increase the original efficiency, productivity or capacity of property, plant and equipment, are also capitalized. The costs of repairs, minor replacements and other projects, which do not increase the original efficiency, productivity or capacity of property, plant and equipment, are expensed as incurred. The determination of cost componentization and related estimated useful lives is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations. The estimates affect depreciation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the net book values of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ net book value. Undiscounted cash flows are based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If impairment occurs, a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and net book value. Such fair value is generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market-based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. Factors that indicate potential impairment include a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset, and a significant change in the asset’s physical condition or use. As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the economic slowdown from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed our long-lived assets for impairment at March 31, 2020, and concluded that there was no impairment. No impairments of long-lived assets were recorded during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The determination of impairments could be a significant element in arriving at the results of operations. Impairment charges would impact total costs and expenses and net Property, Plant & Equipment in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.
Depreciation Expense
We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives after considering salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. Depreciation lives related to our significant assets primarily range between 12 to 35 years. However, factors such as maintenance levels, economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental requirements could cause us to change our estimates, and impact our future calculation of depreciation. The determination of estimated useful lives is a significant element in arriving at depreciation expense. The estimates affect depreciation expense and cost componentization in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.
Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, we may become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be probable or possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable. Costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed. Contingent liabilities are recorded when probable and reasonably estimable. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of any such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Estimates related to contingencies affect operating expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and liabilities in our balance sheets.
