Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8 of this report.
Recent Developments
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our financial performance, primarily through unrealized losses on commercial loans previously originated for sale which we have now decided to retain. Our net income of $80.1 million in 2020 reflected pre-tax charges of approximately $5.6 million for such losses, substantially all unrealized, on our commercial loans held at fair value which were primarily related to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Additional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic included an approximate $1.1 million increase in the provision for credit losses in 2020 related to economic factors. These charges were recognized primarily in the first quarter of 2020. As a result of the potentially unique impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have added new loan tables under “Financial Condition-Loan Portfolio”, which detail diversification by loan type, collateral and other characteristics. The $67.8 million of hotel loans in our $1.57 billion commercial loans held at fair value portfolio may represent an elevated risk. Of that $1.57 billion, $50.2 million, with a weighted average origination loan-to-value of 57%, are in deferral with respect to principal and interest payments. The loans in deferral consist of four hotel loans totaling $40.4 million and one retail property loan (a movie complex) of $9.8 million. However, $1.43 billion of that $1.57 billion portfolio are multi-family loans (apartments), which have an updated expected Covid-19 pandemic cumulative loss rate of 1.2% based on an analysis by a nationally recognized analytics firm. Substantially all of these loans are recorded on the balance sheet at a 1% discount, which largely offsets those projected cumulative Covid-19 pandemic losses. Our next largest $1.55 billion loan portfolio is comprised of securities-backed lines of credit (“SBLOC”), and insurance policy cash value-backed lines of credit (“ IBLOC") loans which have not incurred credit losses, notwithstanding the recent historic declines in equity markets. Over half of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan portfolio is U.S. government guaranteed, and the U.S. government paid principal and interest on those loans for a six month period in 2020. The six months of principal and interest payments funded by the U.S. government were made on SBA 7a loans pursuant to The CARES Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”) and were largely completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, became law in December 2020 and provided for at least an additional two months of principal and interest payments on SBA 7a loans, with up to five months of payments for hotel, restaurant and other more highly impacted loans. Unlike the six months of CARES Act payments, these additional payments are capped at $9,000 per month. The portions of SBA 7a loans not guaranteed by the U.S. government may also have an elevated risk, but are diversified with respect to loan type. That diversification is detailed in tables appearing later in this section including a table illustrating diversification for the non-guaranteed portions of 7a loans in deferral. The majority of the balance of SBA loans consists of commercial mortgages with 50% to 60% origination date loan-to-value. For leases which experience credit issues, we have recourse to the leased vehicles. While there is uncertainty related to the future, we believe these are positive characteristics of our loan portfolio which demonstrate lower risk than other forms of lending.
U.S. government efforts to address the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic include several actions which have and will directly impact us as follows:
Under the Cares Act, the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) provided for our making loans as an SBA lender which are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government to allow businesses to continue funding their payrolls and related costs. We originated approximately 1,250 PPP loans, totaling in excess of $200 million, which we expect will net approximately $5.5 million of fees and interest. The average loan size was approximately $165,000, with over 90% of the loans under $350,000. While it was originally anticipated that these fees would be recognized earlier, new legislation and rulemaking have resulted in their estimated recognition over approximately eleven months beginning April 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 provides for additional PPP loans and we are planning to lend within that program. As that new legislation includes lost revenue thresholds for participation, we believe that loan volume and fees will likely be less than for the first PPP.
The SBA began, in April 2020, to make six months of principal and interest payments on SBA 7a loans, which are generally 75% guaranteed by the U.S. government. As of December 31, 2020, we had $337.9 million of related guaranteed balances, and additionally had $167.7 million of PPP loans which were also guaranteed. The majority of the six months of support expired in the fourth quarter of 2020, and we began approving Covid-19 pandemic-related deferrals for principal and interest payments as requested by borrowers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, became law in December 2020 and provided for at least an additional two months of payments on SBA 7a loans, and up to five months of such payments for hotel, restaurant and other more highly impacted loans. Unlike the Cares Act, these payments are capped at $9,000 per month. Additionally, we have and are granting monthly principal and interest deferrals for certain other loans, as shown in the table summarizing loan payment deferrals below.
Per section 4013 of the CARES Act, accounting and banking regulators have determined that loans with Covid-19 pandemic-related deferrals of principal and interest payments will not, during the deferral period, be classified as delinquent, non-accrual or restructured. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, extended that treatment for deferrals through the earlier of December 31, 2021, or the end of the national emergency.
In the third quarter of 2020, we decided to retain the existing portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaling $1.57 billion which had been originated for sale or securitization. Further, we are not currently planning any future securitizations. The portfolio is mostly comprised of multi-family loans, specifically apartment buildings, and comprises the majority of the commercial loans at fair value on our balance sheet, with the balance of that category comprised of the government guaranteed portion of SBA loans.

In the table above, the total loan balance deferrals for SBL categories are comprised of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans. The CARES Act provided SBA 7a borrowers six months of principal and interest payments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, became law in December 2020 and provided for at least two additional months of payments on SBA 7a loans which begin on February 1, 2021. Hotel, restaurant and other loans more highly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic will receive up to five additional months of payments made for them. Unlike the CARES Act, these payments will be capped at $9,000 per month. Accordingly, we expect deferrals to decrease when those payments are reinstituted at that date. In addition to the payments being made on these loans by the U.S. government, the following table details the diversification of the non-guaranteed portions of SBA 7a loans in deferral, which we believe is a mitigant to potential losses. Additional diversification tables by geography and loan size are also presented under “Financial Condition-Loan Portfolio”. The unguaranteed portions of SBA 7a loans total $101.5 million and may represent an elevated risk. The following table details the loan types for the $14.8 million of the unguaranteed portions of 7a deferrals which are included in the table above.

* At December 31, 2020, SBA 7a loans, included in SBL, totaled $439.0 million of which $101.5 million was not U.S. government guaranteed. The CARES Act provided SBA 7a borrowers six months of principal and interest payments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, became law in December 2020 and provided for an additional two months of payments on SBA 7a loans which begin on February 1, 2021, with up to five months for hotel and restaurant loans. Accordingly, we expect deferrals to decrease when those payments are reinstituted at that date.
Key Performance Indicators
We use a number of key performance indicators to measure our overall financial performance. We describe how we calculate and use a number of these performance indicators and analyze their results below.
Return on assets and return on equity. Two performance indicators we believe are commonly used within the banking industry to measure overall financial performance are return on assets and return on equity. Return on assets measures the amount of earnings compared to the level of assets utilized to generate those earnings. It is derived by dividing net income by average assets. Return on equity measures the amount of earnings compared to the equity utilized to generate those earnings. It is derived by dividing net income by average shareholders’ equity.
Net interest margin and credit losses. The largest component of our earnings is net interest income, or the difference between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets consisting of loans and investments, less the interest on our funding, consisting primarily of deposits. The key performance indicator for net interest income is net interest margin, derived by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Higher levels of earnings and net interest income, on lower levels of assets, equity and interest-earning assets are generally desirable. However, these indicators must be considered in light of regulatory capital requirements which impact equity, and credit risk inherent in loans. Accordingly, the magnitude of credit losses is an additional key performance indicator.
Other performance indicators. Other performance indicators we use include loan growth, non-interest income growth and the level of non-interest expense.
Results of performance indicators. In the five year period ended December 31, 2020, we have transitioned from a balance sheet which was significantly comprised of local Philadelphia commercial real estate loans, to other types of lending which we believe are lower risk. These include: multi-family (apartment) loans in selected national regions; loans collateralized by securities (“SBLOC”) and the cash value of life insurance (“IBLOC”); SBA loans, a significant portion of which are government guaranteed or must have loan-to-value ratios lower than other forms of lending; and leasing to which we have access to underlying vehicles. These loan categories have grown significantly which we believe has contributed to improved financial performance over the past five years.
Our most recent improved financial performance is reflected in a number of these performance indicators. In 2020, return on assets and return on equity amounted to 1.34% and 15.08%, respectively, compared to 1.09% and 11.57% in the prior year. Net interest margin increased over that period, to 3.45% in 2020 compared to 3.32% in 2019. Deposit accounts generated by our payments business has resulted in a cost of funds lower than other forms of funding which contributed to that increase. The payments business contributed to increases in non-interest income, as fees earned from transactions on these accounts increased 14.3% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, the increase in net interest income more than offset the elimination of gains on loan securitization sales realized in 2019, which resulted from a decision to hold certain loans instead of securitizing them. Non-interest expense between those years also decreased. Please see Item 6. Selected Financial Data for a five year summary of financial results.
Overview
In 2020, we recorded net income of $80.1 million compared to $51.6 million in 2019, with pre-tax income from continuing operations increasing to $108.3 million from $72.5 million. The increases resulted primarily from net interest income, which increased $53.6 million between those periods. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from an increase in average loans and leases to $3.94 billion from $2.42 billion in 2019. The increase in average loans reflected growth in small business (primarily SBA), leases, SBLOC and IBLOC and commercial loans, at fair value. Commercial loans, at fair value were previously generated for sale or securitization but we decided in 2020 to retain those loans on the balance sheet. The aforementioned $53.6 million increase in net interest income more than offset a $19.5 million reduction in non-interest income. That reduction primarily reflected gains on securitizations in 2019 which were absent in 2020. In 2020, we recorded unrealized losses of $5.6 million related to loans previously generated for securitizations, resulting primarily from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Those losses compared to gains of $24.1 million related to securitizations in 2019. As a result of historic Federal Reserve rate reductions in first quarter 2020, our interest expense in 2020 decreased by $22.4 million compared to the prior year. Non-interest expense, after
excluding $8.9 million of civil money penalties in 2019, increased $5.2 million year over year and the primary component of that increase was salaries and employee benefits.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting and reporting policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the determination of our allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and securities, our determination of the fair value of financial instruments and the level in which an instrument is placed within the valuation hierarchy, and income taxes involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than our other significant accounting policies.
We determine our allowance for credit losses with the objective of maintaining an allowance level we believe to be sufficient to absorb our estimated current and future expected credit losses. We base our determination of the adequacy of the allowance on periodic evaluations of our loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, expected default probabilities, the amount of loss we may incur on a defaulted loan, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and historical loss experience. We also evaluate economic conditions and uncertainties in estimating losses and other risks in our loan portfolio. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, we may need additional provisions for credit losses. Any such additional provisions for credit losses will be a direct charge to our earnings. See “Allowance for Credit Losses.”
The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. Our valuation methods and inputs consider factors such as types of underlying assets or liabilities, rates of estimated credit losses, interest rate or discount rate and collateral. Our best estimate of fair value involves assumptions including, but not limited to, various performance indicators, such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios and the possibility of obligor refinancing. One significant input is that $1.43 billion of commercial real estate at fair value are multi-family loans (apartments). Multi-family loans have an updated expected Covid-19 pandemic cumulative loss rate of 1.2% based on an analysis by a nationally recognized analytics firm.To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, subsequent adjustments to the financial statements may be required.
At the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period.
We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses on securities result from credit, based on evaluations of the creditworthiness of the issuers or guarantors, and underlying collateral, as applicable. In addition, we consider the continuing performance of the securities. We recognize credit losses through the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If management believes market value losses are not credit related, we recognize the reduction in other comprehensive income, through equity. We evaluate whether a credit loss exists by considering primarily the following factors: (a) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (d) changes in the financial condition of the security’s underlying collateral and (e) the payment structure of the security. If a credit loss is determined, we estimate expected future cash flows to estimate the credit loss amount with a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources and internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the security.
We account for our stock-based compensation plans based on the fair value of the awards made, which include stock options, restricted stock, and performance based shares. To assess the fair value of the awards made, management makes assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture rates and dividend rates. All of these estimates and assumptions may be susceptible to significant change that may impact earnings in future periods.
We account for income taxes under the liability method whereby we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the carrying values on our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Results of Operations
Overview: Net interest income continued its upward trend in 2020, increasing $53.6 million over the prior year, primarily as a result of higher balances of loans in all major loan categories, including commercial loans previously originated for sale. We decided to retain those loans, which are now shown as commercial loans, at fair value on the balance sheet. Accordingly, average balances for those loans grew 153%, to $1.43 billion, in 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of our decision to retain them. The increase in net interest income also reflected increases in other loan categories. From year end 2019 to year end 2020, SBA and leasing balances grew 14% and 6%, respectively. Net interest income additionally benefited from a lower cost of funds, resulting primarily from historic Federal Reserve rate reductions in first quarter 2020. For 2020, funding costs were 62 basis points lower than 2019 compared to a 44 basis point decrease in yield on interest earning assets. The provision for credit losses increased $2.0 million to $6.4 million in 2020. Non-interest income in 2020 decreased by $19.5 million compared to the prior year. That reduction reflected $24.1 million of gains related to securitizations in 2019. In 2020 there were no securitizations, and net losses of $3.9 million were recognized on that portfolio primarily as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are currently not planning any future securitizations. We instead plan to continue to hold the $1.57 billion of related loans on our balance sheet as interest-earning assets. In 2017 through 2019, we sponsored six securitizations, approximately six months apart, which resulted in gains on sale in the quarter of securitization. Future gains on sale will not occur with the retention of the portfolio of loans which would otherwise have been securitized. The loans will continue to be fair valued, which may result in income or loss. While gains on sale will not occur, interest income will be earned for the lives of these loans, which are generally recorded at 1% discounts and which have exit and prepayment fees which may vary.
In 2020, total non-interest expense decreased $3.7 million to $164.8 million, reflecting a $7.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $2.8 million increase in FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by $8.9 million of civil money penalties in 2019. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflected increases in incentive compensation, compliance, risk management and IT expense. The increase in FDIC insurance expense reflected balance sheet growth. We have targeted control over non-interest expense as a key strategic goal.
At December 31, 2020, our total loans, including commercial loans, at fair value, amounted to $4.46 billion, an increase of $1.46 billion, or 48.5%, over the $3.0 billion balance at December 31, 2019, reflecting growth in all major categories of loans and the decision to retain loans which were originally generated for sale or securitization. Our investment securities available-for-sale decreased $114.5 million to $1.21 billion from $1.32 billion between those respective dates as prepayments of higher yielding securities accelerated after the Federal Reserve rate reductions in first quarter 2020.
Net Income: 2020 compared to 2019. Net income from continuing operations was $80.6 million in 2020 compared to $51.3 million in 2019 while income before taxes was, respectively, $108.3 million and $72.5 million, an increase of $35.8 million. In 2020, net interest income grew by $53.6 million while non-interest income decreased $19.5 million. The $53.6 million, or 37.9%, increase in 2020 net interest income over 2019 resulted primarily from higher balances of loans previously originated for sale or securitization, and higher SBA and leasing balances. The reduction in non-interest income reflected $24.1 million of gains related to securitizations in 2019. In 2020 there were no securitizations, and net losses of $3.9 million on loans previously generated for sale or securitization were recognized primarily as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 compared to 2019, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid, debit and related fees, increased 14.3% to $74.5 million. The increase reflected increased volumes of transactions including volume increases from new relationships.
In 2020, total non-interest expense decreased $3.7 million to $164.8 million, reflecting a $7.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $2.8 million increase in FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by $8.9 million of civil money penalties in 2019. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflected increases in incentive compensation, compliance, risk management and IT expense. The increase in FDIC insurance expense reflected balance sheet growth.
A 21% federal corporate tax rate was effective for 2020 and 2019. The combined federal and state income tax rate was 26% in 2020. It was lower than the 29% rate in 2019 primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of the $8.9 million of civil penalties in 2019.
Reflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $80.6 million in 2020 compared to $51.3 million in 2019, or continuing operations earnings per diluted share of $1.38 compared to $0.89 in 2019. Net loss from discontinued operations was $512,000 for 2020 compared to net income of $291,000 for 2019. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $1.37 for 2020 compared to $0.90 for 2019 on net income of $80.1 million and $51.6 million, respectively.
Net Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Net income from continuing operations was $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018 while income before taxes was, respectively, $72.5 million and $119.8 million, a decrease of $47.3 million. In 2019, net interest income grew by $20.4 million and non-interest income decreased $49.7 million. The $20.4 million, or 16.9%, increase in 2019 net interest income over 2018 resulted primarily from higher balances of commercial loans originated for sale. Net interest income also benefited from increases in other loan categories. From year end 2018 to year end 2019, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing balances grew 30%, 22% and 10%, respectively. The $49.7 million decrease in non-interest income reflected a $65.0 million gain on sale of the Safe Harbor Individual Retirement Account (“SHIRA”) portfolio in 2018 and a $10.5 million increase in prepaid, debit card and related fees in 2019.
In 2019 compared to 2018, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid, debit and related fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased 17.8% to $74.5 million. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million to $24.1 million which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019. Additionally, in 2018, $3.7 million of charges resulted from the investment in unconsolidated entity while we had no such charges in 2019. That investment resulted from the sale of certain discontinued loans into a securitization in 2014. See Note W to the financial statements. In 2019, total non-interest expense increased $17.2 million to $168.5 million, reflecting a $14.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and $8.9 million in civil money penalties which were partially offset by decreases of $2.5 million in legal fees, $1.8 million in FDIC expense and $1.3 million in data processing expense. Salary and benefits expense increased by $14.4 million reflecting higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher information technology and loan and payments infrastructure expense. In 2019, non-interest expense included $8.9 million of expense for a $1.4 million Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) civil money penalty and a $7.5 million FDIC civil money penalty. FDIC insurance expense decreased $1.8 million in 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance rate applicable to the Bank.
Reflecting these changes, net income from continuing operations amounted to $51.3 million in 2019 compared to $87.5 million in 2018, or continuing operations earnings per diluted share of $0.89 compared to $1.53 in 2018. Net income from discontinued operations was $291,000 for 2019 compared to $1.1 million for 2018. Including discontinued operations, diluted income per share was $0.90 for 2019 compared to $1.55 for 2018 on net income of $51.6 million and $88.7 million, respectively.
Net Interest Income: 2020 compared to 2019. Our net interest income for 2020 increased to $194.9 million, an increase of $53.6 million, or 37.9%, from $141.3 million for 2019, reflecting a $31.2 million, or 17.4%, increase in interest income to $210.8 million from $179.6 million for 2019. The increase in interest income reflected the impact of loan growth, including the impact of the decision to retain loans previously generated for sale or securitization. Our average loans and leases increased 63.0% to $3.94 billion in 2020 from $2.42 billion for 2019, while related interest income increased $43.7 million on a tax equivalent basis. The largest increase in average loans and leases was in commercial loans previously originated for sale, now retained on the balance sheet, which increased $864.1 million. Related interest income increased $36.4 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. Small business loan (primarily SBA) and leasing interest income respectively increased $8.1 million and $1.6 million. Notwithstanding significant increases in balances, SBLOC and IBLOC interest decreased by $1.8 million as a result of the Federal Reserve rate reductions. Our average investment securities were $1.32 billion for 2020 compared to $1.41 billion for 2019, while related interest income decreased $4.5 million on a tax equivalent basis primarily as a result of Federal Reserve rate reductions. Those rate reductions also contributed to the increase in net interest income as they were reflected in a decrease in interest expense of $22.4 million or 58.4% to $15.9 million, from $38.3 million in 2019.
Our net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets) for 2020 increased 13 basis points to 3.45% from 3.32% for 2019, as the decrease in cost of funds was greater than the decrease in the yield on earning assets. The average yield on our interest earning assets decreased to 3.74% from 4.18% for 2019, a decrease of 44 basis points, while the cost of total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.30% for 2020 from 0.92% for 2019, a decrease of 62 basis points. The net interest margin increase reflected the impact of weighted average 4.8% floors on an average $1.4 billion portfolio of commercial real estate variable rate apartment loans, which were previously originated for sale or securitization, which significantly offset lower rates in the similarly sized SBLOC and IBLOC portfolio. That SBLOC and IBLOC portfolio yield decreased to approximately 2.5% after the Federal Reserve rate reductions. However, that portfolio, due to the nature of the collateral, has not experienced losses. The net interest margin also reflected the impact of growth in higher yielding SBA loans and leases, which have
yielded in the 5% to 6% range.The yield on loans in total decreased to 4.34% from 5.25%, a decrease of 91 basis points. The yield on the investment portfolio decreased less, 14 basis points, but further decreases may occur in that and the loan portfolio as maturities reprice to a lower rate environment. In 2020, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $4.86 billion, compared to $3.82 billion in 2019, an increase of 27.4%, reflecting growth in debit and prepaid card account balances. The yield on those deposits decreased to 0.23% in 2020 compared to 0.80% in 2019. Savings and money market balances averaged $291.2 million in 2020 compared to $37.7 million in 2019 with an average 0.15% rate in 2020 compared to 0.48% in 2019. The $253.5 million increase in savings and money market between these respective periods reflected growth in interest-bearing accounts offered by our affinity group clients to prepaid and debit card account customers. The lower rates on these deposit categories also reflected the impact of Federal Reserve rate reductions.
Net Interest Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Our net interest income for 2019 increased to $141.3 million, an increase of $20.4 million, or 16.9%, from $120.8 million for 2018, reflecting a $31.6 million, or 21.4%, increase in interest income to $179.6 million from $148.0 million for 2018. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the impact of higher balances of commercial real estate loans held-for-sale and other loan growth and higher loan yields resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases in 2018. The impact of the prior year rate increases was partially offset by Federal Reserve rate decreases in the latter part of 2019. Our average loans and leases increased 24.9% to $2.42 billion in 2019 from $1.94 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $31.8 million on a tax equivalent basis. The largest increases in average loans and leases and related interest income was in commercial loans originated for sale, which respectively increased $300.2 million and $17.6 million. Small business loan, SBLOC and IBLOC and leasing interest income respectively increased $6.3 million, $6.1 million and $2.4 million. Our average investment securities were $1.41 billion for 2019 compared to $1.38 billion for 2018, while related interest income increased $245,000 on a tax equivalent basis.
Our net interest margin (calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets) for 2019 increased 13 basis points to 3.32% from 3.19% for 2018. The increase reflected higher yields on variable rate loans resulting from the aforementioned Federal Reserve increases, partially offset by decreased yields on taxable investment securities. While the yield on loans increased to 5.25% from 4.92%, the yield on taxable investment securities decreased to 3.01% from 3.05%. The decrease reflected higher premium amortization resulting from prepayments. The average yield on our interest earning assets increased to 4.18% from 3.86% for 2018, an increase of 32 basis points, while the cost of total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.92% for 2019 from 0.70% for 2018, an increase of 22 basis points. While variable rate loans and securities adjusted more fully to Federal Reserve rate changes, deposits adjusted only partially to the Federal Reserve changes. In 2019, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $3.82 billion, compared to $3.50 billion in 2018, an increase of 9.1%. The yield on those deposits increased to 0.80% in 2019 compared to 0.66% in 2018. Savings and money market balances averaged $37.7 million in 2019 compared to $362.3 million in 2018 with an average 0.48% rate in 2019 compared to 0.79% in 2018. The decrease reflected the SHIRA sale.

In 2020 compared to 2019, average interest earning assets increased to $5.64 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion, or 31.2%, from 2019. The increase reflected a $1.52 billion, or 63.0%, increase in average loans and leases. The increase resulted primarily from higher balances of loans previously originated for sale into securitizations and loan growth in SBLOC and IBLOC, small business (primarily SBA) and leasing. Average balances of investment securities decreased $91.3 million, or 6.5%, as prepayments of higher yielding securities accelerated after the Federal Reserve rate reductions in first quarter 2020. In 2020, average demand and interest checking deposits amounted to $4.86 billion, compared to $3.82 billion in 2019, an increase of 27.4%, reflecting growth in debit and prepaid card account balances. In 2019 compared to 2018, average interest earning assets increased to $4.30 billion, an increase of $463.3 million, or 12.1%, from 2018. The increase reflected a $482.2 million, or 24.9%, increase in average loans and leases. The increase resulted primarily from higher balances of retained loans previously originated for sale into securitizations, SBLOC and IBLOC, SBA and leasing. Average balances of investment securities increased $28.6 million, or 2.1%, as reinvestments were accelerated when long term rates increased. Average demand and interest checking deposits increased $317.9 million, or 9.1%.
Volume and Rate Analysis. The following table sets forth the changes in net interest income attributable to either changes in volume (average balances) or to changes in average rates from 2018 through 2020 on a tax equivalent basis. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.

Provision for Credit Losses. Our provision for credit losses was $6.4 million for 2020, $4.4 million for 2019 and $3.6 million for 2018. Provisions are based on our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, particularly in light of current economic conditions and the estimated impact of charge-offs. The provision for credit losses in 2020 increased $2.0 million over the prior year, as the provision for leasing was increased $2.1 million, reflecting a $1.7 million increase in leasing charge-offs. The increase in the 2019 provision over 2018 reflected decreases in provisions for small business loans and leasing which were more than offset by a $1.0 million provision for a consumer line of credit, for which remaining loans now have minimal balances and are no longer offered. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses amounted to $16.1 million, or 0.61%, of total loans. Effective January 1, 2020, we implemented current and future expected credit loss accounting guidance which differs from prior guidance. Accordingly, provisions between these years lack comparability. We believe that our allowance is adequate to cover current and future expected losses, consistent with the newly implemented guidance. For more information about our provision and allowance for credit losses and our loss experience see “-Financial Condition-Allowance for Credit Losses” and “-Summary of Loan and Lease Loss Experience,” below.
Non-Interest Income: 2020 compared to 2019. Non-interest income was $84.6 million for 2020 compared to $104.1 million for 2019. The $19.5 million, or 18.7%, reduction resulted primarily from the $27.9 million change in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commercial loans previously originated for sale or securitization which was partially offset by an increase in prepaid and debit card and related fees. Prepaid and debit card and related fees increased $9.3 million, or 14.3%, to $74.5 million for 2020 from $65.1 million for 2019. The increase reflected higher transactional volume including increases from new relationships. Related fees in this category include income related to the use of cash in ATMs for prepaid payroll cardholders. Automated Clearing House (“ACH”), card and other payment processing fees decreased $2.3 million, or 24.3%, to $7.1 million for 2020 compared to $9.4 million for 2019. The decrease relected the exit of higher risk ACH customers and the exit of a relationship with an ownership change. Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commercial loans originated for sale reflected a loss of $3.9 million in 2020 resulting primarily from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, compared to a gain of $24.1 million in the prior year. In 2019 the vast majority of the $24.1 million gain was realized upon the closing of two securitizations, while the $3.9 million 2020 loss resulted from fair value adjustments to our portfolio of commercial loans held at fair value, including losses on related hedges. Total fair value adjustments related to the previously securitized loans now held on the balance sheet were $5.6 million, but were partially offset by $1.7 million of exit fees on loan payoffs in that portfolio. We are planning to hold the loans which were originated for securitizations in our portfolio
and are not currently planning any further securitizations. Leasing related income was comparable, increasing $51,000, or 1.6%, to $3.3 million for 2020 from $3.2 million for 2019. Other non-interest income increased $1.4 million, or 64.2%, to $3.6 million in 2020 from $2.2 million in 2019. The increase refected the recovery of certain prepaid fees which were written off in prior years and other legal settlements.
Non-Interest Income: 2019 compared to 2018. Non-interest income was $104.1 million for 2019, compared to $153.8 million for 2018. The $49.7 million decrease reflected a $65.0 million gain on the sale of the SHIRA portfolio in 2018. In 2019 compared to 2018, the primary drivers of fee income, prepaid, debit and related fees and fees on ACH, card and other payment processing fees, increased $11.2 million, or 17.8%, to $74.5 million. The majority of the growth resulted from prepaid, debit and related fees which increased $10.5 million, or 19.2%, to $65.1 million, primarily as a result of transaction volume increases from new clients and organic growth from existing clients. ACH, card and other payment processing fees, which increased $723,000, or 8.4%, to $9.4 million reflected increases in payment volume, especially from the rapid funds transfer product. That product allows customers to transfer funds from their bank account to their payee’s account in minutes. Gain on sale of loans increased $3.6 million to $24.1 million, which resulted primarily from a higher volume of loans sold into securitizations in 2019 which more than offset the decrease in market spreads. Any gain or loss is subject to market conditions.
Non-Interest Expense: 2020 compared to 2019. Total non-interest expense in 2020 was $164.8 million, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 2.2%, over the $168.5 million in 2019. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased to $101.7 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 7.9%, from $94.3 million for 2019. Higher salary expense in 2020 reflected higher incentive compensation expense, and higher compliance, risk management and IT expense, which were primarily related to the payments business. Depreciation and amortization decreased $494,000, or 13.4%, to $3.2 million in 2020 from $3.7 million in 2019 which reflected reduced spending on fixed assets and equipment. Rent and occupancy decreased $1.1 million, or 16.4%, to $5.5 million in 2020 from $6.6 million in 2019, reflecting the impact of office relocations. Data processing expense decreased $182,000, or 3.7%, to $4.7 million in 2020 from $4.9 million in 2019. The decrease reflected reduced check clearing and other costs related to non-electronic account processing, as paper based accounts and transactions decreased, while electronic transaction volume increased. Printing and supplies decreased $123,000, or 19.3%, to $514,000 in 2020 from $637,000 in 2019, reflecting decreased levels of paper based accounts and transactions. Audit expense decreased $724,000, or 40.6%, to $1.1 million in 2020 from $1.8 million in 2019 which reflected decreased regulatory and tax compliance audit fees. Legal expense decreased $178,000, or 3.3%, to $5.1 million for 2020 from $5.3 million in 2019, reflecting decreased costs associated with two fact-finding inquiries by the SEC as described in Note O to the financial statements. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $975,000, or 63.7%, to $556,000 for 2020 from $1.5 million for 2019. The reduction reflected the completion of the amortization of our customer list intangible for the Stored Value Solutions purchase from Marshall Bankfirst. FDIC insurance expense increased $2.8 million, or 39.6%, to $9.8 million for 2020 from $7.0 million in 2019, primarily due to an increase in average liabilities, against which insurance rates are applied. Software expense increased $1.3 million, or 10.2%, to $14.0 million in 2020 from $12.7 million in 2019 which reflected increased expenditures for information technology infrastructure to improve efficiency and scalability, especially for SBLOC and IBLOC loans. Insurance expense increased $343,000, or 13.9%, to $2.8 million in 2020 from $2.5 million in 2019, reflecting higher rates and higher coverage limits. Telecom and IT network communications expense increased $130,000, or 8.7%, to $1.6 million in 2020 from $1.5 million in 2019. The increase reflected migration to a new fiber optic network to improve performance and efficiency. Consulting expense decreased $1.9 million, or 58.0%, to $1.4 million in 2020 from $3.2 million in 2019, reflecting decreased BSA and other regulatory consulting. In 2019, civil money penalties were assessed in the amount of $8.9 million, comprised of a $7.5 million FDIC settlement and a $1.4 million SEC settlement. Additionally, lease termination expense amounted to $908,000 in 2019. Other non-interest expense decreased $174,000, or 1.3%, to $12.7 million in 2020 from $12.9 million in 2019 reflecting $2.0 million of decreased travel expense, partially offset by increases of $962,000 in SBA guarantee fees, $548,000 in marketing expense and $367,000 in other operating taxes.
Non-Interest Expense: 2019 compared to 2018. Total non-interest expense in 2019 was $168.5 million, an increase of $17.2 million, or 11.4%, over the $151.3 million in 2018. Salary expense increased $14.4 million to $94.3 million in 2019, an increase of 18.1% over the $79.8 million in 2018. The increase reflected higher incentive compensation for loan, deposit and fee production and higher information technology and loan and payments infrastructure expense. Depreciation and amortization decreased $301,000 to $3.7 million, or 7.5%, from $4.0 million in 2018, which reflected reduced spending on fixed assets and equipment. Rent and occupancy increased $1.2 million to $6.6 million, or 21.1%, from $5.5 million in 2018, which reflected newly leased space for the commercial real estate loan origination department. Data processing expense decreased $1.3 million, or 20.9%, to $4.9 million from $6.2 million in 2018. The decrease reflected the impact of a renegotiated data processing contract and lower account and transaction volume as a result of the planned exit of an affinity program which had changed ownership and the SHIRA sale. Printing and supplies expense decreased $269,000, or 29.7%, to $637,000 from $906,000 in 2018. The decrease reflected a
reduction for SHIRA accounts which were transferred in the third quarter of 2018, in connection with the related sale. Audit expense decreased $217,000, or 10.8%, to $1.8 million from $2.0 million in 2018, which reflected decreased regulatory and tax compliance audit fees. Legal expense decreased $2.5 million, or 32.2%, to $5.3 million from $7.8 million in 2018. The decrease in legal expense reflected lower fees related to regulatory matters including fees associated with an SEC subpoena related to the restatement of the financial statements for 2014 and prior years. Amortization of intangible assets remained consistent at $1.5 million in 2019 and 2018. FDIC insurance decreased $1.8 million, or 20.3%, to $7.0 million from $8.8 million in 2018, which reflected the impact of a decrease in the FDIC assessment rate. Software expense decreased $573,000, or 4.3%, to $12.7 million from $13.3 million in 2018. The decrease reflected reduced expenditures for technology infrastructure to improve efficiency and scalability, including BSA software to satisfy BSA regulatory requirements. Insurance expense decreased $103,000, or 4.0%, to $2.5 million from $2.6 million in 2018. Telecom and information technology network communications expense increased $120,000, or 8.7%, to $1.5 million from $1.4 million in 2018. Securitization and servicing expense decreased $36,000, or 30.8%, to $81,000 from $117,000 in 2018. Consulting expense remained consistent at $3.2 million in 2019 and 2018. Other non-interest expense decreased $394,000, or 3.0%, to $12.9 million from $13.3 million in 2018. The decrease resulted primarily from decreases of $317,000 in credit bureau expense, $280,000 for prepaid and debit deposit account losses, $163,000 for customer identification expense and $100,000 for postage. These decreases were partially offset by a $748,000 increase in travel.
Income Tax Benefit and Expense
Income tax expense for continuing operations was $27.7 million, $21.2 million and $32.2 million, respectively, for 2020, 2019 and 2018. The tax rate of 25.6% in 2020 compared to 29.3% in 2019 and 26.9% in 2018. The higher rate in 2019 resulted primarily from the non-deductibility of $8.9 million of civil money penalties in that year. The difference between those rates and the federal statutory rate of 21% resulted primarily from state income taxes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity defines our ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, satisfy borrowing needs and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Based on our sources of funding and liquidity discussed below, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for our needs in the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. We invest the funds we do not need for daily operations primarily in our interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. Interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, maintained on an overnight basis, averaged $193.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the prior year fourth quarter average of $569.8 million. The reduction reflected loan growth and the Federal Reserve’s temporary suspension of reserve requirements.
Our primary source of funding has been deposits. Average deposits in 2020 increased by $1.21 billion, or 30.0%, to $5.23 billion. While that increase primarily reflected increases in transaction accounts from debit and prepaid card account balances, it also reflected an increase in average savings and money market accounts of $253.5 million between those periods. That growth resulted from interest-bearing accounts offered by our affinity group clients to prepaid and debit card account customers. The increased deposits were primarily utilized to fund loan growth, as securities balances decreased as a result of prepayments which accelerated after the Federal Reserve’s first quarter 2020 rate reductions. Overnight borrowings are also periodically utilized as a funding source to facilitate cash management, but average balances have not generally been significant.
Our primary source of liquidity is available-for-sale securities which amounted to $1.21 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2019. In excess of $700 million of our available-for-sale securities are U.S. government agency securities which are highly liquid and which may be pledged as collateral for our Federal Home Loan Bank line of credit. Loan repayments, also a source of funds, were exceeded by new loan disbursements during 2020. As a result, at December 31, 2020 outstanding loans amounted to $2.65 billion, compared to $1.82 billion at the prior year end, an increase of $828.1 million, which was generally funded by deposits. Commercial loans held at fair value increased to $1.81 billion from $1.18 billion between those respective dates, an increase of $630.3 million. In 2019 and previous years, these loans were originated for sale into securitizations at six month intervals. In 2020, we decided to not pursue additional securitizations and no future securitizations are currently planned. While securitizations resulted in cash inflows, such inflows were generally retained at the Federal Reserve to provide funding for the following securitization. Accordingly, the retention of these loans will not significantly impact our overall liquidity, which is primarily based upon our securities and other U.S. government guaranteed instruments. While gains on sale will be eliminated, the net interest margin benefits from these loans, which have an average rate floor of 4.8%.
While we do not have a traditional branch system, we believe that our core deposits, which include our demand, interest checking, savings and money market accounts, have similar characteristics to those of a bank with a branch system. The majority of our deposit accounts are generated by third parties and as a result are classified as brokered by the FDIC. The FDIC guidance for classification of deposit accounts as brokered is relatively broad, and generally includes accounts which were referred to or “placed” with the institution by other companies. If the Bank ceases to be categorized as “well capitalized” under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits without the consent of the FDIC. In such a case, the FDIC’s refusal to grant consent to our accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits could effectively restrict or eliminate the ability of the Bank to operate its business lines as presently conducted. In December 2020, the FDIC issued a new regulation which should result in certain of our deposits being reclassified from brokered to non-brokered, effective April 1, 2021.
We focus on customer service which we believe has resulted in a history of customer loyalty. Stability, lower cost compared to certain other funding sources and customer loyalty comprise key characteristics of core deposits which we believe are comparable to core deposits of peers with branch systems. Certain components of our deposits do experience seasonality, creating greater excess liquidity at certain times in 2020. The largest deposit inflows have generally occurred in the first quarter of the year when certain of our accounts are credited with tax refund payments from the U.S. Treasury.
While consumer deposit accounts including prepaid and debit card accounts comprise the majority of our funding needs, we maintain secured borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank, or (“the FHLB”), and the Federal Reserve. As of December 31, 2020, we had a line of credit with the Federal Reserve which exceeded one billion dollars, which may be collateralized by various types of loans, but which we generally have not used. To mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve has encouraged banks to utilize their lines to maximize the amount of funding available for credit markets. Accordingly, the Bank has borrowed on its line on an overnight basis and may do so in the future. The amount of loans pledged varies and the collateral may be unpledged at any time to the extent remaining collateral value exceeds advances. Additionally, we have pledged approximately $1.3 billion of multi-family loans to the FHLB. As a result, we have approximately $1.0 billion of availability on our line of credit which we can access at any time. As noted previously, that line may be increased by $700 million by pledging our U.S. government agency securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amount outstanding on the Federal Reserve line or on our FHLB line. We expect to continue to maintain our facilities with the FHLB and Federal Reserve. We actively monitor our positions and contingent funding sources daily. As discussed later in this section, in 2020, we issued $100 million in senior notes, providing additional liquidity to our holding company.
Included in our cash and cash-equivalents at December 31, 2020, were $345.5 million of interest earning deposits, which primarily consisted of deposits with the Federal Reserve. These amounts may vary on a daily basis. Accordingly, the majority of our available liquidity is comprised of the aforementioned available-for-sale securities and lines of credit with the FHLB and Federal Reserve.
In 2020, $233.8 million of securities sales and repayments exceeded purchases of $34.7 million. In 2019, $173.9 million of securities sales and repayments exceeded purchases of $157.5 million. In 2018, $213.2 million of securities sales and repayments exceeded purchases of $134.8 million. As shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash required to fund loans was $836.2 million in 2020, $322.6 million in 2019 and $115.1 million in 2018.
At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding commitments to fund loans, including unused lines of credit, of $2.17 billion, the vast majority of which are SBLOC lines of credit which are variable rate. We attempt to increase such line usage; however, usage percentages have been historically consistent and the majority of these lines of credit have historically not been drawn. The recorded amount of such commitments has, for many accounts, been based on the full amount of collateral in a customer’s investment account. Accordingly, the funding requirements for such commitments occur on a measured basis over time and are expected to be funded by deposit growth. Additionally, these loans are “demand” loans and as such, represent a contingency source of funding.
As a holding company conducting substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries, our near term needs for liquidity consist principally of cash needed to make required interest payments on our trust preferred securities and senior debt, while our liquidity consists primarily of dividends from the Bank to the holding company. In the third quarter of 2020, holding company cash was increased by approximately $98.2 million as a result of the net proceeds of a senior debt offering. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash reserves of approximately $111.3 million at the holding company. The quarterly interest payments on the $100.0 million of senior debt are approximately $1.2 million based on a fixed rate of 4.75%. Current quarterly interest payments on the $13.4 million of subordinated debentures are approximately $118,000 based on a floating rate of 3.25% over LIBOR. The senior debt matures in
August 2025 and the subordinated debentures mature in March 2038. In lieu of repayment of debt from Bank dividends, industry practice includes the issuance of new debt to repay maturing debt.
We must comply with capital adequacy guidelines issued by the FDIC. A bank must, in general, have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% and a ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets of 6.50% to be considered “well capitalized”. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the most recent quarter. “Tier 1 capital” includes common shareholders’ equity, certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles. At December 31, 2020, we were “well capitalized” under banking regulations.

Asset and Liability Management
The management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is essential to controlling interest rate risk and optimizing interest margins. An interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that, within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates. Interest rate sensitivity measures the relative volatility of an institution’s interest margin resulting from changes in market interest rates.
As a financial institution, potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of our market risk. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of our earnings and the market value of our interest earning assets, other than those with short-term maturities. We do not own any trading assets. We used hedging transactions only for fixed rate commercial loans previously originated for sale into secondary securities markets. We no longer originate loans for sale or securitization and no longer engage in new hedging transactions.
We have adopted policies designed to manage net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements. To effectively administer the policies and to monitor our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain an asset/liability committee, consisting of the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and others. This committee meets quarterly to review our financial results, develop strategies to optimize margins and to respond to market conditions. The primary goal of our policies is to optimize margins and manage interest rate risk, subject to overall policy constraints for prudent management of interest rate risk.
We monitor, manage and control interest rate risk through a variety of techniques, including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis (also known as “gap analysis”) and an interest rate risk management model. With the interest rate risk management model, we project future net interest income and then estimate the effect of various changes in interest rates on that projected net interest income. We also use the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios. Traditional gap analysis involves arranging our interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference (or “interest rate sensitivity gap”) between the assets and liabilities that we estimate will reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period.
Both interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Interest rate sensitivity modeling requires, among other things, estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates, future cash flows and discount rates. Gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice, and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at
the same time and in the same amount. Gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, all else equal. During a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely.
The following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing structure of our interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2020. Except as stated below, the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability. The majority of demand and interest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be “core” deposits, or deposits that will generally remain with us regardless of market interest rates. We estimate the repricing characteristics of these deposits based on historical performance, past experience, judgmental predictions and other deposit behavior assumptions. However, we may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates for competitive or other reasons. Additionally, although non-interest-bearing demand accounts are not paid interest, we estimate certain of the balances will reprice as a result of the contractual fees that are paid to the affinity groups which are based upon a rate index, and therefore are included in interest expense. We have adjusted the demand and interest checking balances in the table downward, to better reflect the impact of their partial adjustment to changes in rates. Loans and security balances, which adjust more fully to market rate changes, are based upon actual balances. The vast majority of loans at their interest rate floors are included in commercial loans, at fair value and totaled approximately $1.57 billion at December 31, 2020. The table does not assume any prepayment of fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. The table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing and related behavior of certain categories of assets and liabilities is beyond our control as, for example, prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits. As a result, certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels.

The method used to analyze interest rate sensitivity in this table has a number of limitations. Certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in interest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same or similar time periods. The interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different times than changes in market interest rates, with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates. Additionally, the actual prepayments and withdrawals we experience when interest rates change may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table.
Because of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above, we believe that interest sensitivity modeling may more accurately reflect the effects of our exposure to changes in interest rates, notwithstanding its own limitations. Net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the consolidated balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits. As such, net interest income simulation is designed to address the
probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the consolidated balance sheet to those changes. Market Value of Portfolio Equity (“MVPE”) represents the modeled fair value of the net present portfolio value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items.
We believe that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable; however, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from presumed behavior of various deposit and loan categories. The following table shows the effects of interest rate shocks on our MVPE and net interest income. Rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately and sustain parallel shifts. For interest rate increases or decreases of 100 and 200 basis points, our policy includes a guideline that our MVPE ratio should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively, and that net interest income should not decrease more than 10% and 15%, respectively. As illustrated in the following table, we complied with our asset/liability policy guidelines at December 31, 2020, with the exception of the decrease of 200 basis points in the net interest income scenario, which is discussed in the note below*. While our modeling suggests an increase in market rates of 200 basis points will have a positive impact on margin (as shown in the table below), the actual amount of such increase cannot be determined, and there can be no assurance any increase will be realized.

*The target Fed Funds rate at December 31, 2020 was .25% while the ten year treasury yield was below 1%.; thus, scenarios calculating Present Value of Equity and Net Interest Income at 100 and 200 basis point rate declines must assume negative interest rates. The potential impact of negative rates is difficult or impossible to estimate and the changes shown should be viewed accordingly. While the change in the minus 200 scenario exceeds the guideline, we believe that our bias toward maintaining asset sensitivity is prudent in the long term.
If we should experience a mismatch in our desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in our MVPE subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate, we have a number of options available to remedy such a mismatch. We could restructure our investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes. We could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes, or we could emphasize deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities.
Historically, we have used variable rate loans as the principal means of limiting interest rate risk. The Bank’s SBLOC, IBLOC and SBA loans are primarily variable rate as are the vast majority of commercial loans held at fair value. Additionally, approximately $1.57 billion of commercial loans held at fair value were at their approximate weighted average rate floors of 4.8% at December 31, 2020. Because these loan rates reached their floors, their previous benefit in higher rate environments at December 31, 2019, is now generally reflected in the flat rate modeling, and in net interest income actually being realized. Model projections for down rate scenarios indicate greater reductions in net interest income compared to the prior year-end. However, these down rate projections would require negative interest rate assumptions which we believe are significantly less reliable than higher rate assumptions. We continue to evaluate market conditions and may change our current interest rate strategy in response to changes in those conditions.
Financial Condition
General. Our total assets at December 31, 2020 were $6.28 billion, of which our total loans and commercial loans held at fair value from continuing operations were $4.46 billion and investment securities available-for-sale were $1.21 billion. At December 31, 2019, our total assets were $5.66 billion, of which our total loans and commercial loans held at fair value from continuing operations were $3.00 billion and investment securities available-for-sale were $1.32 billion. The increase in total assets at December 31, 2020 reflected our decision to hold commercial loans held at fair value which were previously originated for securitization on the balance sheet and loan growth in all major loan categories.
Interest Earning Deposits and Federal Funds Sold. At December 31, 2020, we had a total of $339.5 million of interest earning deposits, comprised primarily of balances at the Federal Reserve, which pays interest on such balances. At December 31, 2019, we had $924.5 million of such balances. The decrease reflected the use of excess cash balances at the Federal Reserve primarily to fund loan originations.
Investment Portfolio. For detailed information on the composition and maturity distribution of our investment portfolio, see Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total investment securities available-for-sale decreased to $1.21 billion on December 31, 2020, a decrease of $114.5 million, or 8.7%, from a year earlier. The decrease reflected investment security prepayments resulting from Federal Reserve rate reductions in first quarter 2020.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, requires that debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses unrelated to credit losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Marking an available-for-sale portfolio to market (fair value) results in fluctuations in the level of shareholders’ equity and equity-related financial ratios as market interest rates and market demand for such securities cause the fair value of fixed-rate securities to fluctuate. Debt securities for which we had the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity were classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost as of December 31, 2019. In March 2020, we transferred the four securities comprising our held-to-maturity securities portfolio to available-for-sale. The interest rates for these securities utilize LIBOR as a benchmark and the transfer was made pursuant to a provision of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU” or “Update”) 2020-04, which sought to maximize management and accounting flexibility as a result of the future phase-out of LIBOR.
The four securities transferred to available-for-sale and their values as of December 31, 2020 were as follows: a trust preferred unrated security issued by an insurance company with a book value of $10.0 million and a fair value of $6.8 million; and three securities supported by diversified portfolios of corporate securities with a book value of $75.0 million and a fair value of $75.1 million.
Under the accounting guidance related to current expected credit loss (“CECL”), changes in fair value of securities unrelated to credit losses, continue to be recognized through equity. However, credit-related losses are recognized through an allowance, rather than through a reduction in the amortized cost of the security. The guidance for the new CECL allowance includes a provision for the reversal of credit losses in future periods based on improvements in credit, which was not included in previous guidance. Generally, a security’s credit-related loss is the difference between its amortized cost basis and the best estimate of its expected future cash flows discounted at the security’s effective yield. That difference is recognized through the income statement, as with prior guidance, but is renamed a provision for credit loss. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized no credit-related losses on our portfolio.
The following table presents the book value and the approximate fair value for each major category of our investment securities portfolio. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our investments were categorized as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity (in thousands).

Investments in FHLB and Atlantic Central Bankers Bank stock are recorded at cost and amounted to $1.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $5.3 million at December 31, 2019. Both the FHLB and Atlantic Central Bankers Bank require its correspondent banking institutions to hold stock as a condition of membership. The change in balance resulted from differences in FHLB stock, the amount of which is determined by periodic overnight borrowings, as the $40,000 balance of ACBB stock stayed constant.
In 2020 we began pledging loans against our line of credit at the FHLB and had no securities pledged as of December 31, 2020. At December 31 2019, investment securities with a fair value of approximately $262.0 million were pledged against that line.
As of December 31, 2020 the principal balance of the security we owned issued by CRE-1 was $7.3 million. Repayment is expected from the workout or disposition of commercial real estate collateral, all proceeds of which will first repay our $7.3 million balance. The collateral consists of a hotel in a high-density populated area in a northeastern major metropolitan area. The hotel was valued at over $35 million, based upon a 2020 post-Covid appraisal. As of December 31, 2020 the principal balance of the security we owned issued by CRE-2 was $12.6 million. Repayment is expected from the workout or disposition of commercial real estate collateral, after repayment of more senior tranches. Our $12.6 million security has 27% excess credit support; thus, losses of 27% of remaining security balances would have to be incurred, prior to any loss on our security. Additionally, the commercial real estate collateral was appraised in 2017, with certain of those appraisals updated in 2020 at the direction of the special servicer, for an appraised value of approximately $137 million. The remaining principal to be repaid on all securities is approximately $114.2 million. The excess of the appraised amount over the remaining principal to be repaid on all securities further reduces credit risk, in addition to the 27% credit support within the securitization structure. However, reappraisals for remaining properties could result in further decreases in collateral valuation. While available information indicates that collateral valuation will be adequate to repay our security, there can be no assurance that such valuations will be realized upon loan resolutions, and that deficiencies will not exceed the 27% credit support.

Commercial Loans, at Fair Value. Commercial loans held at fair value are comprised of commercial real estate loans and SBA loans originated for sale or securitization in the secondary market, which are now being held on the balance sheet with no planned future sales or securitizations.The fair value of commercial real estate loans and SBA loans reflects discounted cash flow based on quoted prices for the same or similar loans or other market information. The analysis is performed on an individual loan basis for commercial mortgage loans and a pooled basis for SBA loans. Commercial loans held at fair value increased to $1.81 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.18 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from the decision to hold these loans on the balance sheet instead of selling or securitizing them.
Loan Portfolio. We have developed a detailed credit policy for our lending activities and utilize loan committees to oversee the lending function. SBLOC, IBLOC and other consumer loans, small business loans (“SBL”) and leases each have their own loan committee. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Credit Officer serve on all loan committees. Each committee also includes lenders from that particular type of specialty lending. The Chief Credit Officer is responsible for both regulatory compliance and adherence to our internal credit policy. Key committee members have lengthy experience and certain of them have had similar positions at substantially larger institutions.
We originate substantially all of our portfolio loans, although from time to time we purchase lease pools. If a proposed loan should exceed our lending limit, we would sell a participation in the loan to another financial institution. The following table summarizes our loan portfolio, excluding loans at fair value, by loan category for the periods indicated (in thousands):

* The preceding table shows small business loans and small business loans held at fair value. The small business loans held at fair value are comprised of the government guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans at the dates indicated (in thousands). A reduction in SBL non-real estate from $293.5 million to $255.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted from the commencement of U.S. treasury repayments of PPP loans which totaled $42.1 million in fourth quarter 2020. At December 31, 2020 PPP loans totaled $167.7 million.
** Securities Backed Lines of Credit, or SBLOC, are collateralized by marketable securities, while Insurance Backed Lines of Credit, or IBLOC, are collateralized by the cash surrender value of insurance policies. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, IBLOC loans amounted to $437.2 million and $144.6 million.
*** In 2020, we began originating loans to investment advisors for purposes of debt refinance, acquisition of another firm or internal succession. Maximum loan amounts are subject to loan-to-value ratios of 70%, based on third party business appraisals, but may be increased depending upon the debt service coverage ratio. Personal guarantees and blanket business liens are obtained as appropriate.
**** Included in the table above under other consumer loans are demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loan balances totaling $663,000 and $882,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Estimated overdraft charge-offs and recoveries are reflected in the allowance for credit losses and have been immaterial.

(a)This is the portion of SBA 7a loans (7a) and PPP which have been guaranteed by the U.S. government, and therefore is assumed to have no credit risk.
(b)Substantially all of these loans are made under the SBA 504 Fixed Asset Financing program (504) which dictates origination date loan-to-value percentages (“LTV”), generally 50-60%, to which the bank adheres.
(c)Of the $14 million Construction SBA loans, $11 million are 504 first mortgages with an origination date LTV of 50-60% and $3 million are SBA interim loans with an approved SBA post-construction full takeout/payoff.
(d)The $102 million represents the unguaranteed portion of 7a loans which are 70% or more guaranteed by the U.S. government. 7a loans are not made on the basis of real estate LTV; however, they are subject to SBA's "All Available Collateral" rule which mandates that to the extent a borrower or its 20% or greater principals have available collateral (including personal residences), the collateral must be pledged to fully collateralize the loan, after applying SBA-determined liquidation rates. In addition, all 7a and 504 loans require the personal guaranty of all 20% or greater owners.
(e)The $18 million of non-SBA loans are mainly comprised of approximately 20 conventional coffee/doughnut/carryout franchisee note purchases. The majority of purchased notes were made to multi-unit operators and are considered seasoned and have performed as agreed. A $2 million guaranty by the seller, for an 11% first loss piece, is in place until August 2021.

For SBLOC, we generally lend up to 50% of the value of equities and 80% for investment grade securities. While equities have fallen in excess of 30% in recent periods, the reduction in collateral value of brokerage accounts collateralizing SBLOCs generally has been less, for two reasons. First, many collateral accounts are “balanced” and accordingly, have a component of debt securities, which have either not decreased in value as much as equities, or in some cases may have increased in value. Secondly, many of these accounts have the benefit of professional investment advisors who provided some protection against market downturns, through diversification and other means. Additionally, borrowers often utilize only a portion of collateral value, which lowers the percentage of principal to the market value of collateral.

IBLOC loans are backed by the cash value of life insurance policies which have been assigned to us. We lend up to 100% of such cash value. Our underwriting standards require approval of the insurance companies which carry the policies backing these loans. Currently, seven insurance companies have been approved and, as of August 14, 2020 all were rated Superior (A+ or better) by AM BEST.

Allowance for Credit Losses. We review the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses on at least a quarterly basis to determine a provision for credit losses to maintain our allowance at a level we believe is appropriate to recognize current expected credit losses. Our chief credit officer oversees the loan review department, which measures the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses independently of loan production officers. A description of loan review coverage is summarized in Note E to the financial statements which also provides a description of the methodology by which our quarterly provision for credit losses is determined.

Although we consider our allowance for credit losses to be adequate based on information currently available, future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions, our ongoing loss experience and that of our peers, changes in management’s assumptions as to future delinquencies, recoveries and losses, deterioration of specific credits and management’s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases.
The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses among the types of loans or leases in our portfolio at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

*The ending balance for loans in the unallocated column represents deferred costs and fees.
The following table summarizes select asset quality ratios for each of the periods indicated:
As of or
for the years ended
December 31,
Ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans
0.61%
0.56%
Ratio of the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans (1)
126.39%
113.00%
Ratio of non-performing assets to total assets (1)
0.20%
0.16%
Ratio of net charge-offs to average loans
0.07%
0.12%
(1) Non-performing loans are defined as non-accrual loans and loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest and are both included in our ratios.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans increased to 0.61% at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.56% at December 31, 2019. The higher ratio in 2020 reflected an increase in the allowance which was relatively more than the increase in loan balances. The largest components of the increase in the allowance to $16.1 million at year end 2020 from $10.2 million at year- end 2019 was in direct lease financing and the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans. SBA loans comprise the vast majority of small business (SBL) loans. The allowance on direct lease financing and SBL commercial mortgage loans increased $3.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, between those dates. The increase in the direct lease financing allowance reflected increased net charge-offs in 2020. The increase in the SBL commercial mortgage allowance reflected additional allowance allocations on specific loans individually evaluated for an allowance for credit losses. For the year 2020, the largest segment of the loan portfolio continued to be SBLOC and IBLOC which have historically experienced low levels of credit losses as a result of the collateral against these loans. SBLOC are collateralized by marketable securities and IBLOC are collateralized by the cash value of life insurance (see Item 1. “Business-Lending-SBL Loans”). The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans increased to 126.39% at December 31, 2020 from 113.0% over the prior year end, reflecting the increase in the allowance for credit losses which exceeded the relative increase in non-performing loans. Similarly, the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets increased to 0.20% from 0.16%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans decreased to 0.07% for 2020 compared to 0.12% for the prior year, reflecting loan growth as net charge-offs were comparable in those years.
Net Charge-Offs. Net charge-offs were comparable in 2020 and 2019, respectively, at $2.9 million in 2020 and $2.8 million, compared to $2.0 million in 2018. In 2020, the majority of net charge-offs were in direct lease financing.
Non-accrual Loans, Loans 90 Days Delinquent and Still Accruing, Other Real Estate Owned, and Troubled Debt Restructurings. Loans are considered to be non-performing if they are on a non-accrual basis or they are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. A loan which is past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest remains on accrual status only when it is both adequately secured as to principal and interest, and is in the process of collection. Troubled debt restructurings are loans with terms that have been renegotiated to provide a material reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a weakening in the financial positions of the borrowers. The following tables summarize our non-performing loans, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and our loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest.

We had no commitments to extend credit to loans classified as troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2020.
The Company had three troubled debt restructured loans that had been restructured within the last 12 months that have subsequently defaulted. The largest was for a single borrower who came under financial stress and agreed to an orderly liquidation of vehicles collateralizing their $15.3 million loan balance at March 31, 2020, which was reflected in the direct lease financing balance and in troubled debt restructurings at that date. The borrower subsequently filed for bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court gave the Company permission to sell the vehicles which were transferred to other assets as of June 30, 2020. Subsequent vehicle sales have repaid substantially all of the balance which has been reduced to $57,000.
The following table summarizes the other two loans that were restructured within the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 that have subsequently defaulted (in thousands).

We had $12.2 million of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020, compared to $5.8 million of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2019. The $6.4 million increase reflected $15.1 million of loans placed on non-accrual status, partially offset by $1.8 million of charge-offs and $6.9 million of loan payments. Loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest amounted to
$497,000 and $3.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The $2.8 million decrease reflected $1.9 million of additions, partially offset by $1.7 million of loan payments, $1.0 million of charge-offs, $1.0 million of transfers to repossessed assets and $1.0 million of transfers to non-accrual. We had no OREO in continuing operations at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and no activity during the year.
We evaluate loans under an internal loan risk rating system as a means of identifying problem loans. The following table provides information by credit risk rating indicator for each segment of the loan portfolio excluding loans at fair value Decemer 31, 2019 (in thousands). In 2020 loans accordingly classified were segregated by year of origination and are shown in Note E to the financial statements.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entity. On December 30, 2014, the Bank sold a portion of its discontinued commercial loan portfolio. The purchaser of the loan portfolio was a newly formed entity, Walnut Street 2014-1 Issuer, LLC or Walnut Street. The price paid to the Bank for the loan portfolio with a face value of approximately $267.6 million was approximately $209.6 million, of which approximately $193.6 million was in the form of two notes issued by Walnut Street to the Bank; a senior note in the principal amount of approximately $178.2 million bearing interest at 1.5% per year and maturing in December 2024 and a subordinate note in the principal amount of approximately $15.4 million, bearing interest at 10.0% per year and maturing in December 2024. At December 31, 2020, a balance of $31.3 million remained on the consolidated balance sheet, representing the remaining balances of these notes. Interest is not being accrued on this investment and changes in its value, determined by discounting estimated future cash flows, are recorded in the income statement under “change in value of investment in unconsolidated entity”. In 2020, there was a $45,000 net decrease in value, compared to no net decrease in value in 2019. A $30.0 million credit, collateralized by a commercial retail property with multiple tenants, is comprised of a $17.0 million loan which had been sold to Walnut Street, and $13.0 million loan which is included in commercial loans, at fair value. The underlying collateral consists of a multi-tenant shopping center and the loan value had been previously written down as a result of a decreased occupancy rate. By December 31, 2020 the center had been substantially all leased and previous write-downs had been reversed. On March 13, 2019, we renewed this loan for four years and reduced the interest rate to the following: LIBOR plus 2% in year one, increasing 0.5% each year until the fourth year when the rate will be LIBOR plus 3.5% which will also be the rate for a one year extension, if exercised. The loan is performing in accordance with those restructured terms.
Assets Held-for-Sale from Discontinued Operations. Assets held-for-sale as a result of discontinued operations, primarily commercial, commercial mortgage and construction loans, amounted to $113.6 million at December 31, 2020 and were comprised of $91.3 million of net loans and $22.3 million of other real estate owned. The balance of other real estate owned includes a Florida mall, which has been written down to $15.0 million. We expect to continue our efforts to dispose of the mall, which was appraised in June 2020 for $17.5 million. At December 31, 2019, discontinued assets of $140.7 million were comprised of $115.9 million of net loans and $24.8 million of other real estate owned. We continue our efforts to transfer the loans to other financial institutions, and dispose of the other real estate owned.
Deposits. Our primary source of funding is deposit acquisition. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including prepaid and debit card and demand, savings and money market accounts. The majority of deposit balances are comprised of accounts generated by third parties. At December 31, 2020, we had total deposits of $5.46 billion compared to $5.05 billion at December 31, 2019, which reflected an increase of $410.0 million, or 8.1%, between 2020 and 2019. The increase in deposits reflects growth in prepaid and debit card accounts and daily balance variances. A diversified group of prepaid and debit card accounts, which have an established history of stability and lower cost than certain other types of funding, comprise the majority of our deposits. Prepaid accounts include general purpose reloadable, debit, medical spending, payroll, gift, commercial, incentive plan and other accounts. The following table presents the average balance and rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated (in thousands):

Short-Term Borrowings. We had no outstanding advances from the FHLB or Federal Reserve at December 31, 2020 on our lines of credit with them. We discuss these lines in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. We had no outstanding amounts borrowed on the Bank’s lines of credit at December 31, 2020. We do not have any policy prohibiting us from incurring debt. Tables showing information for securities sold under repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings are as follows.

We do not have any policy prohibiting us from incurring debt. We have issued senior debt at the holding company, which may be used for various corporate purposes including stock repurchases, or in the future for common stock dividends, although we historically have not paid such dividends. Those funds may also be downstreamed to the Bank, where for purposes of the Bank only, they would constitute tier one capital. Additionally, we have issued subordinated debentures which are grandfathered to also constitute tier one capital, but only at the Bank level. Those instruments are described below.
Senior debt. On August 13, 2020, we issued $100.0 million of senior debt with a maturity date of August 15, 2025, and a 4.75% interest rate, with interest paid semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. The Senior Notes are our direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in priority with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. When these instruments mature in 2025, in lieu of repayment from Bank dividends, industry practice includes the issuance of new debt to repay maturing debt.
Subordinated debentures. As of December 31, 2020, we had two established statutory business trusts: The Bancorp Capital Trust II and The Bancorp Capital Trust III, which we refer to as (“the Trusts”). In each case, we own all the common securities of the Trusts. These trusts issued preferred capital securities to investors and invested the proceeds in us through the purchase of junior subordinated debentures issued by us. These debentures are the sole assets of the trusts. The $10.3 million of debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust II and the $3.1 million of debentures issued to The Bancorp Capital Trust III were both issued on November 28, 2007, mature on March 15, 2038 and bear interest equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.25%.
Long-term Borrowings. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had long term borrowings of $40.3 million and $41.0 million respectively, which consisted of sold loans which were accounted for as a secured borrowing, because they did not qualify for true sale accounting.
Shareholders’ Equity. At December 31, 2020, we had $581.2 million in shareholders’ equity compared to $484.5 million at the prior year end. The increase primarily reflected 2020 net income. The increase also reflected the increase in the market value of securities resulting from the decrease in longer term interest rates.
Off-balance Sheet Commitments
We are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.
Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk for us at December 31, 2020, were our unused commitments to extend credit, which were approximately $2.16 billion, and standby letters of credit, which were approximately $1.8 million, at December 31, 2020. The vast majority of commitments reflect SBLOC commitments, which are variable rate, and connected to lines of credit collateralized by marketable securities. The amount of the line is generally based upon the value of the collateral, and not expected usage. The majority of these available lines have not been drawn upon, and SBLOC loans are “demand” loans and can be called at any time.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Since we expect that many of the commitments or letters of credit we issue will not be fully drawn upon, the total commitment or letter of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. We base the amount of collateral we obtain when we extend credit on our credit evaluation of the customer. SBLOC commitments are limited to a percentage of the collateral value, which varies for equities and fixed income securities. For IBLOC, the commitment may as high as the cash value of the applicable insurance policy. Collateral for other loan commitments varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.

Impact of Inflation
The primary impact of inflation on our operations is on our operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.
