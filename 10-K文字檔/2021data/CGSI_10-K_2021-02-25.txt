As at April 30, 2018, we had total liabilities of $170,601 compared with $119,967 as at April 30, 2017. The increase in total liabilities was attributed to $62,651 of additional funding from related parties to support our ongoing operating activities offset by a decrease of
$12,017 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities relating to timing differences between the payment of outstanding obligations as they become due.
As at April 30, 2018, we had a working capital deficit of $170,601 compared with a working capital deficit of $119,967 as at April 30, 2017. The increase in working capital deficit was due to operating expenditures incurred during the year which were funded by financing from related parties.

During the year ended April 30, 2018, we used $62,651 of cash for operating activities as compared to $19,379 during the year ended April 30, 2017. The increase is due to the fact that the Company received more funding from related parties during the period to support an increase in operating activity.
Cashflow from Financing Activities

Trends
We are in the pre-development stage, have not generated any revenue and have no prospects of generating any revenue in the foreseeable future. We are unaware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our business or income, either in the long term of short term.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.
Inflation
The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting which conforms to US GAAP.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We are required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.
