ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This discussion and analysis reflects our financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the audited financial statements, which appear beginning on page of this annual report. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding the Company and the Bank provided in this annual report.
General
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) had spread world-wide, led to severe unemployment, and is impacting individuals, households and businesses in a multitude of ways. We have been deemed an essential service and exempted from the shutdowns across the country. We continue to operate while keeping the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and the communities we serve as our top priority. We continue to meet customers’ needs and have tried to minimize any inconvenience to our customers. Our offices remain open, with drive-thru facilities fully operational, while lobby access is by appointment only.
Across our workforce, approximately 30% transitioned to working remotely starting in March 2020, relying on our technology infrastructure and systems that we have designed for resilience and security. All employees returned to working in their respective offices by mid-June 2020. We have been able to continue serving customers and communities, successfully managing critical functions and keeping our lines of business operating while supporting our employees. We have maintained social distancing measures for our employees working in our offices, have restricted lobby access, conducted sterilization cleanings of certain of our locations on an as needed basis, and provided appropriate facemasks and other sanitizing supplies to
protect employees, customers and our communities. We continue to monitor new information from governmental authorities and provide timely communications to our employees.
The Federal and state governments have been diligently working to contain COVID-19’s spread. The result of these containment strategies has had an enormous impact on the economy and will have a negative impact on borrowers’ ability to make timely loan payments as many businesses are forced to temporarily shut down or reduce capacity. The Federal Reserve Board along with the other various regulatory agencies have issued joint guidance to financial institutions who are working with borrowers affected by the coronavirus. The Company is working with borrowers, and instituted a loan deferment program whereby short-term deferrals of payments were provided. The deferred payments will be collected at the original maturity date or at the time the loan is ultimately paid off. As of December 31, 2020, all of the loans modified by us have resumed normal monthly payments. We will not report these loans as delinquent and we continued to recognize interest income during the deferral period. We increased the qualitative factors in our calculation of the allowance for loan losses for loans to borrowers that took advantage of the deferment program until normal monthly payments resumed. No increase in the allowance was deemed necessary due to the increase in the qualitative factors. These loans will be closely monitored to determine collectability and accrual and delinquency status will be updated as deemed appropriate.
Under Section 4013 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then suspend the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”), and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Financial institutions wishing to utilize this authority were required to make a policy election, which applies to any COVID-19 modification made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of either December 31, 2020 or the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. Similarly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs. Lastly, prior to the enactment of the CARES Act, the banking regulatory agencies provided guidance as to how certain short-term modifications would not be considered TDRs, and have subsequently confirmed that such guidance could be applicable for loans that do not qualify for favorable accounting treatment under Section 4013 of the CARES Act. Based on this guidance, the Company does not believe that TDRs will significantly change as a result of the modifications granted. The full impact on our lending and other business activities as a result of new government and regulatory policies, programs and guidelines, as well as regulators’ reaction to such activities, remains uncertain.
Overview
Our business consists primarily of taking deposits and securing borrowings and investing those funds, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, including non-owner-occupied properties, construction loans for owner-occupied, one- to four-family residential real estate and home equity loans. To a lesser extent, we also originate multifamily, commercial real estate and consumer loans. At December 31, 2020, $66.1 million, or 95.0% of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, $13.6 million of which were non-owner-occupied loans, $1.2 million of which were construction loans and $586,000 of which were home equity loans.
The significant majority of loans we originate are conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and in the low interest rate environment in recent years, almost all of these loans have been long-term, fixed rate loans. In order to address our interest rate risk, in recent years we have sold a significant
portion of these conforming, fixed-rate, long-term loans on an industry-standard, servicing-released basis, as well as increasing the percentage of adjustable rate residential loans in portfolio.
We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including savings accounts (passbook and money market) and certificates of deposit. We utilize advances from the FHLB for funding and asset/liability management purposes. At December 31, 2020, we had $19.4 million in advances outstanding with the FHLB.
We do not offer checking accounts which may impact our ability to attract and grow core deposits. We have always been dependent, in part, on retail certificates of deposit as a funding source for our loans, and in recent years we have accepted jumbo certificates of deposit through an online service, as well as municipal certificates of deposit. We have used these non-retail funding sources, as well as advances from the FHLB, to fund our loan growth. Pursuant to our business strategy, we are seeking to increase our core deposits, which we consider our savings and money market accounts and our retail certificates of deposit, by more aggressively marketing and pricing our deposit products.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 we had a net loss of $103,000 compared to a net loss of $61,000 for 2019. The increase in the net loss resulted primarily from a decrease in net interest income of $466,000, and an increase in noninterest expense of $119,000, offset, in part, by an increase of $234,000 in noninterest income and a decrease in income tax expense of $316,000.
Eureka Homestead is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by its primary federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).
Our executive and administrative office is located at 1922 Veterans Memorial Boulevard, Metairie, Louisiana 70005, and our telephone number at this address is (504) 834-0242.

Business Strategy
Our principal objective is to build long-term value for our stockholders by operating a profitable community-oriented financial institution dedicated to meeting the banking needs of our customers by emphasizing personalized and efficient customer service. Highlights of our current business strategy include:
● Continuing to focus on one- to four-family residential real estate lending, including our practice of originating for retention in our portfolio, non-owner-occupied real estate loans. We have been, and will continue to be, primarily a one- to four-family residential real estate lender for borrowers in our market area. As of December 31, 2020, $66.1 million, or 95.0% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, including $13.6 million, or 19.5% of our total loan portfolio, of non-owner-occupied real estate loans. We expect that one- to four-family residential real estate lending will remain our primary lending activity.
● Maintaining our strong asset quality through conservative loan underwriting. We intend to maintain strict, quality-oriented loan underwriting and credit monitoring processes. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no nonperforming assets, or 0.0% of total assets.
● Attracting and retaining customers in our market area and increasing our “core” deposits consisting of savings accounts and retail certificates of deposit. We intend to increase the emphasis of our savings and money market accounts and retail certificates of deposits by more aggressively marketing and pricing these products, thereby decreasing our dependence on non-retail certificates of deposit.
● Remaining a community-oriented institution and relying on high quality service to maintain and build a loyal local customer base. We were established in 1884 and have been operating continuously in the New Orleans metropolitan area since that time. Through the goodwill we have developed over years of providing timely, efficient banking services, we believe that we have been able to attract a solid base of local retail customers on which we hope to continue to build our banking business.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
The following represent our critical accounting policies:
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies.
Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.
The analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value
of the collateral, adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan’s carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results.
Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Bank can be found in Note 18 of the Financial Statements, “Fair Values of Financial Instruments.”
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Total Assets. Total assets decreased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, to $99.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $106.0 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease resulted primarily from decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $7.9 million and net loans of $8.9 million, offset in part by increases in interest-bearing deposits in banks of $7.7 million, investment securities available-for-sale of $730,000 and loans held-for-sale of $2.0 million.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $7.9 million, or 66.7%, to $4.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $11.9 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was principally due to converting low-yielding cash and cash equivalents into higher-yielding certificates of deposit in banks.
Net Loans. Net loans decreased $8.9 million, or 11.3%, to $69.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $78.8 million at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, one- to four-family residential real estate loans decreased $7.4 million, or 10.1%, to $66.1 million from $73.6 million at December 31, 2019, multifamily loans decreased $690,000, or 19.3%, to $2.9 million from $3.6 million at December 31, 2019, commercial real estate loans decreased $753,000, or 67.4%, to $364,000 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2019 and consumer loans increased $5,000, or 2.4%, to $214,000 from $209,000 at December 31, 2019. Decreases in our loan balances reflected our strategy to manage interest rate risk in 2020 by selling most of our conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loan originations which bore lower interest rates.
The reduction in net loans was due primarily to the large amount of refinance activity in the residential loan portfolio. This activity was stimulated by historically low interest rates available on 30-year fixed- rate home loans. The prevailing rates were such that, at the time, we chose to sell most the refinanced loans rather than keep them in portfolio. The decrease in multifamily loans was principally due to a principal
paydown of $300,000 on one loan and a payoff of one loan of $281,000. The decrease in commercial real estate loans was principally due to the payoffs of two loans totaling $704,000.
Securities Available-for Sale. Investment securities available-for-sale, consisting of government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities and SBA 7a Pools backed by real estate and equipment loans, increased $730,000, or 13.7%, to $6.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $5.3 million at December 31, 2019 as a result of securities purchases of $1.9 million exceeding proceeds from sales and principal repayments of $1.2 million during the year.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance. At December 31, 2020, our investment in bank owned life insurance was $4.1 million, an increase of $93,000, or 2.3%, from $4.0 million at December 31, 2019. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding offset for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. Federal regulations generally limit our investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses. Our investment in bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2020 was 20.7% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses.
Deposits. Deposits decreased $1.6 million, or 2.8%, to $56.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $58.0 million at December 31, 2019. Savings accounts and money market accounts increased $54,000, or 1.9%, to $2.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $2.8 million at December 31, 2019. Certificates of deposit decreased $1.7 million, or 3.0%, to $53.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $55.2 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in certificates of deposit resulted from the decision not to renew some maturing retail certificates of deposit at higher local market interest rates. We also utilize non-retail funding sources, such as deposits derived from an online service and from municipalities, to fund our loan origination and growth. Deposits from municipalities decreased significantly during 2020 due to the lower interest rate environment, while we were able to increase deposits from the online service at relatively low interest rates.
Borrowings. Borrowings, consisting entirely of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, decreased $2.1 million or 9.9% to $19.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $21.6 million at December 31 2019 due to maturities not renewed as liquidity was still available from the proceeds of the stock conversion.
Total Equity. Total equity decreased $2.3 million, or 9.7%, to $21.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $24.3 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease resulted primarily from the repurchase of 219,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the year and the net loss of $103,000 in 2020.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
General. We had a net loss of ($103,000) for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of ($61,000) for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $42,000. The increase in the net loss resulted from a decreases in net interest income of $466,000 and benefit for loan losses of $7,000 and an increase in noninterest expense of $119,000, offset, in part, by increases of $234,000 in noninterest income and income tax benefit of $316,000.
Interest Income. Interest income decreased $813,000, or 21.4%, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $657,000 decrease in interest on loans receivable and a $156,000 decrease in interest on other interest-earning assets. The average balance of loans decreased $7.9 million, or 9.7%, to $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $80.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the average yield on loans decreased 44 basis points to 3.87% during 2020 from 4.31% during 2019. The average balance of investment securities decreased $1.3 million, or 19.8%, to $5.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from $6.5 million for the year ended December 21, 2019, while the average yield on investment securities decreased 90 basis points to 1.50% for 2020 from 2.40% for 2019. The average balance of other interest-earning assets increased $9.5 million, or 111.3%, to $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the average yield on other interest-earning assets decreased 143 basis points to 0.45% for 2020 from 1.88% for 2019.
Interest Expense. Total interest expense decreased $347,000, or 17.9%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $250,000, or 19.8%, in interest expense on deposits and a decrease of $97,000, or 14.2%, in interest expense on FHLB advances. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits decreased $3.5 million, or 5.9%, to $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 31 basis points to 1.81% for 2020 from 2.12% for 2019. The average balance of FHLB advances decreased $1.5 million, or 6.2%, to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average cost of these advances decreased 25 basis points to 2.62% for 2020 from 2.87% for 2019.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $466,000, or 25.1%, to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average net interest-earning assets increased $5.3 million year to year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the average balance of other interest-bearing assets year to year. Our interest rate spread decreased 56 basis points to 1.06% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.62% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our net interest margin decreased 49 basis points to 1.45% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.94% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreases in interest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily the result of a decreasing interest rate environment during 2020 causing a mortgage loan refinance boom resulting in our interest-earning assets repricing at a faster rate than the costs on our interest-bearing liabilities.
Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded credits in the provision for loan losses of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the credit in the provision for loan losses in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted from our analysis of the factors described in “Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses.” The allowance for loan losses was $850,000, or 1.22% of total loans, at December 31, 2020, compared to $850,000, or 1.08% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. Classified (substandard, doubtful and loss) loans decreased to $559,000 at December 31, 2020 from $567,000 at December 31, 2019. There were no non-performing loans at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Net recoveries were $2,000 in 2020 compared to $9,000 in 2019, a decrease of $7,000.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $234,000, or 31.6%, to $975,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $741,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees on loans sold of $258,000. This increase was partially offset by a decreases in service charges and other income of $16,000, gains on sales of securities of $6,000 and income from life insurance of $2,000.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $119,000, or 4.9%, to $2.5 million for 2020 from $2.4 million for 2019. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $50,000, or 3.3%, in salaries and employee benefits, primarily from increased commissions paid on higher loan volume in 2020. The increase in noninterest expense also resulted from increases of $47,000 or 235.0% in legal fees, $39,000, or 24.7%, in accounting and consulting expense, $12,000 or 22.2% in FDIC deposit insurance premiums and $21,000, or 9.5% in other expenses. The increase in accounting and consulting expense and legal fees resulted from
increased fees associated with operating as a public company. These increases were offset, in part, by decreases of $47,000, or 18.4%, in occupancy expense and $7,000, or 5.8%, in data processing expense.
We expect noninterest expense to increase because of ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company in 2021, as well as the possible grants of stock options and restricted stock in 2021 pursuant to our Equity Incentive Plan which was approved by our stockholders in 2020.
Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense decreased $316,000 to a benefit of $62,000 for 2020 compared to an expense of $254,000 in 2019. The decrease resulted from the net loss before income tax expense in 2020 and the refund of prior year income taxes as allowed by the CARES Act. We have remaining net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $1.4 million which have no expiration date. At this time we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from a portion of the NOL carryforwards will not be realized within a reasonable time period to offset the amount of tax net operating losses which are the principal cause of our deferred tax asset.
Average balances and yields. The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information at and for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.
(1) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.
(2) Net interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.
(3) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Management of Market Risk
General. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. All directors participate in discussions during the regular board meetings evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, and the level of risk that is appropriate. These discussions take into consideration our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by them.
Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we are using to manage interest rate risk are:
● selling a significant portion of our conforming, long-term, fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loan originations and retaining the non-conforming and shorter-term, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, subject to market conditions and periodic review of our asset/liability management needs;
● trying to reduce our dependence on non-retail certificates of deposit and borrowings to support lending and investment activities and increasing our reliance on our savings accounts and money market accounts, which are less interest rate sensitive than certificates of deposit;
● lengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through longer-term funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the FHLB with terms to maturity of up to 10 years;
● utilizing a rate lock program for loans that we originate for sale and selling loans pursuant to best efforts delivery contracts to eliminate warehouse and pipeline risk; and
● holding relatively short-duration, adjustable rate, highly liquid investment securities.
Our board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our executive management team and other essential operational staff which are responsible for our asset/liability analysis. These officers act as an asset/liability committee and are charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and generally meet monthly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors.
We do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.
Economic Value of Equity and Changes in Net Interest Income. We monitor interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model that estimates the amounts by which the fair value of our assets and liabilities (our economic value of equity or “EVE”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The quarterly reports developed in the simulation model assist us in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate risk to ensure compliance within our policy guidelines.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2020, the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in market interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market
interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.
(1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
(2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.
(3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.
(4) NPV Ratio represents NPV divided by the present value of assets.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2020, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 15.28% increase in EVE. In the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2020, we would have experienced a 15.22% decrease in EVE.
In addition to modeling changes to our EVE, we also analyze estimated changes to net interest income (“NII”) for a prospective twelve-month period under the interest rate scenarios set forth above. The following tables set forth our NII model as of December 31, 2020.
(1) The calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE and NII require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE and NII tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE and NII tables provide an
indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and NII and will differ from actual results.
EVE and NII calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB. At December 31, 2020, we had $19.4 million outstanding in advances from the FHLB, and had the capacity to borrow approximately an additional $17.1 million from the FHLB and an additional $6.6 million on a line of credit with First National Bankers Bank at this date.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash (used in) operating activities was ($2.1 million) and ($2.3 million) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities, which consisted primarily of net change in loans receivable, net change in interest-bearing deposits and net change in investment securities, was $502,000 and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of and the activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances, was ($6.2 million) and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2019 we also had cash provided by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to the conversion.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. We also anticipate continued use of FHLB advances.
At December 31, 2020, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital level of $19.1 million, or 18.94% of adjusted total assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $5.0 million, or 5.00%; and total risk-based capital of $19.7 million, or 43.41% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $4.5 million, or 10.00%. At December 31, 2019, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital level of $18.9 million, or 17.47% of adjusted total assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $5.4 million, or 5.0%; and total risk-based capital of $19.6 million, or 38.94% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $5.0 million, or 10.0%. Accordingly, Eureka Homestead was categorized as well-capitalized at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2020, we had $2.0 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans, all of which represented the balance of remaining funds to be disbursed on construction loans in process. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021 total $11.6 million at December 31, 2020. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the notes to our financial statements beginning on page of this annual report.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
