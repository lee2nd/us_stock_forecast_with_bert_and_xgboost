ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company that is developing GP2, an immunotherapy designed to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer following surgery. GP2 is a 9 amino acid transmembrane peptide of the HER2/neu protein, a cell surface receptor protein that is expressed in a variety of common cancers, including expression in 75% of breast cancers at low (1+), intermediate (2+), and high (3+ or over-expressor) levels. In a completed Phase IIb clinical trial led by MD Anderson Cancer Center, no recurrences were observed in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting after median 5 years of follow-up, if the patient received the 6 primary intradermal injections over the first 6 months. We are planning to commence a Phase III clinical trial in 2021.
To date, we have not generated any revenue and we have incurred net losses. Our net losses were approximately $1.9 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in developing the drug in our pipeline, planning and preparing for clinical trials and general and administrative activities associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and corresponding increased operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our pipeline. Our costs may further increase as we conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approval for and prepare to commercialize our product candidate. We expect to incur significant expenses to continue to build the infrastructure necessary to support our expanded operations, clinical trials, commercialization, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution functions. We will also experience increased costs associated with operating as a public company.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased by $1,548,814, or 59%, to $1,057,606 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2,606,420 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in compensation expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by $12,699, or 2% to $806,188 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $818,887 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was negligible.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception in 2006, we have devoted most of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities. We have not yet achieved commercialization of our product and have a cumulative net loss from our operations. We will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.
We will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and/or debt securities; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful at raising additional capital in the future. If our plans are not achieved and/or if significant unanticipated events occur, we may have to further modify our business plan, which may require us to raise additional capital. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our principal source of liquidity was our cash, which totaled $28,660,375 and $6,835, respectively, and additional loans and accrued unreimbursed expenses from related parties. Historically, our principal sources of cash have included proceeds from the sale of common stock and preferred stock and related party loans. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations. We expect that the principal uses of cash in the future will be for continuing operations, funding of research and development, including our clinical trials, and general working capital requirements.
Cash Flow Activities for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
We incurred net losses of $1,862,962 and $3,425,307 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the decrease was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, advisory and audit expenses, license expenses, and the GMP manufacturing of GP2. Cash was $6,835 at December 31, 2019 and $28,660,375 at December 31, 2020 and increased due to the following reasons:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $1,152,962 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $293,267 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advisory and audit expenses and the GMP manufacturing of GP2.
Investing Activities
We did not use or generate cash from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $29,806,502 during the year ended December 31, 2020, attributable to the completion of the Company’s initial public offering and a follow-on offering. Net cash provided by financing activities was $215,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, attributable to related party loans.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as described by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation expense related to warrants and stock granted to employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense for an award with a performance condition is recognized when the achievement of such performance condition is determined to be probable. If the outcome of such performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have evaluated the following recent accounting pronouncements through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the SEC and believe that none of them will have a material effect on our financial statements:
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases: Topic 842” (“ASU 2016-02”), to supersede nearly all existing lease guidance under GAAP. The guidance would require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach with the option to elect certain practical expedients. The Company has no material leases, thus the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606, but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted in Topic 606. Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1, 2018. The Company has no revenue, thus the adoption of ASU 2016-12 will have no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which modifies the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees to largely align it with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for us for annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. The Company evaluated ASU 2018-07 and determined that the adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
