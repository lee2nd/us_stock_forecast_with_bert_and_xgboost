ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Overview
We offer property and casualty insurance products to individuals through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO’s insureds are located primarily in downstate New York, consisting of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County, although we are actively writing business in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts. We are licensed in the States of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maine, and New Hampshire. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 80.0% of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies.
In addition, through our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, we access alternative distribution channels. Through Cosi, we have the opportunity to partner with name-brand carriers and access nationwide insurance agencies. See “Distribution Channels” below for a discussion of our distribution channels. Cosi receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense paid. Net Cosi revenue is eliminated against commission expense and Cosi related operating expenses are included in other operating expenses. Cosi related operating expenses are not included in our stand-alone insurance underwriting business and, accordingly, its expenses are not included in the calculation of our combined ratio as described below.
We derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO’s insurance policies are written for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums to the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings and may also generate net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on future investments.
Our expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) are incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs include commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and benefits.
Other operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company and operating expenses of Cosi. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive employment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company. Cosi operating expenses primarily include employment, occupancy and consulting costs.
Principal Revenue and Expense Items
Net premiums earned: Net premiums earned is the earned portion of our written premiums, less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement. Insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our insurance policies have a term of one year. Accordingly, for a one-year policy written on July 1, 2020, we would earn half of the premiums in 2020 and the other half in 2021.
Ceding commission revenue: Commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded to quota share treaties are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured.
Net investment income and net gains (losses) on investments: We invest in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed-maturity and equity securities, and other investments. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets, less investment expenses. Net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or are written down as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. We classify our fixed-maturity securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available-for-sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet while our equity securities and other investments report changes in fair value through earnings. See Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion over our accounting policies following Item 16 of this Annual Report.
Other income: We recognize installment fee income and fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non-payment.
Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred: Loss and LAE incurred represent our largest expense item, and for any given reporting period include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations, statistical analyses and actuarial procedures. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate liability based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for certain claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information on such claims. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor affecting our profitability.
Commission expenses and other underwriting expenses: Other underwriting expenses include policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to the underwriting of policies. Policy acquisition costs represent the costs of originating new insurance policies that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of insurance policies (principally commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries). Policy acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as the related premiums are earned. Other underwriting expenses represent general and administrative expenses of our insurance business and are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities such as regulatory fees, telecommunication and technology costs, occupancy costs, employment costs, and legal and auditing fees.
Other operating expenses: Other operating expenses include the corporate expenses of our holding company, Kingstone Companies, Inc., and operating expenses of Cosi. These expenses include executive employment costs, legal and auditing fees, and other costs directly associated with being a public company. Cosi operating expenses primarily include employment costs, occupancy costs and consulting costs.
Stock-based compensation: Non-cash equity compensation includes the fair value of stock grants issued to our directors, officers and employees, and amortization of stock options issued to the same.
Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of KICO, depreciation of the real estate used in KICO’s operations, as well as depreciation of capital expenditures for information technology projects, office equipment and furniture.
Interest expense: Interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the applicable interest rates. Interest expense also includes amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.
Income tax expense: We incur federal income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations as well as state income tax expense for our non-insurance underwriting subsidiaries.
Product Lines
Our product lines include the following:
Personal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and personal umbrella policies.
Commercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office risks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition, we wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we offered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.
In May 2019, due to the poor performance of this line we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions while we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite commercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of December 31, 2020 there are no commercial liability policies in-force. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these expired policies represent approximately 2.5% of net premiums earned and 33.7% of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under “Additional Financial Information”.
Livery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.
Other: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.
Key Measures
We utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:
Net loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company’s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.
Net underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.
Net combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.
Underwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It excludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company’s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.
Distribution Channels
During 2019, we initiated an alternative distribution program through Cosi (“Alternative Distribution”). The goal of this program is to enhance our personal lines distribution channel to include nationally recognized name-brand carriers along with nationwide call center and digital insurance agencies. While still in early stages of development, the impact of this initiative can be measured by the amount of new premiums written compared to total premiums written, which includes renewals from our independent agency network. The table below shows premiums written by distribution channel for our homeowners and dwelling fire components of personal lines.
(1)
Outside of New York
(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Alternative Distribution made up 4.5% and 3.2%, respectively, of direct written premiums for our homeowners and dwelling fire components of personal lines. As discussed above, on July 10, 2020, KICO’s A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating was downgraded from A- (Excellent) to B++ (Good). This action has resulted in and will continue to result in a decrease in the business from Cosi, a multi-state licensed general agent that had partnered with name-brand carriers, some of which require an A.M. Best rating of A- (Excellent) from its partners.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not materialize. Application of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of similar companies.
We believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and LAE, including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers, deferred ceding commission revenue, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, the impairment of investment securities, intangible assets and the valuation of stock-based compensation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements following Item 16 of this Annual Report.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations for the periods indicated:
(1)
Effective July 1, 2019, our personal lines 10% quota share treaty expired on a run-off basis. Effective December 15, 2019, we entered into a 25% quota share treaty. Effective December 31, 2020, our personal lines 25% quota share treaty expired on a cut-off basis.
(2)
The years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers.
(3)
The year ended December 31, 2020 includes catastrophe losses from Tropical Storm Isaias, which has been designated PCS Storm 2044.
Direct Written Premiums
Direct written premiums during the year ended December 31, 2020 (“Year Ended 2020”) were $169,318,000 compared to $171,214,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 (“Year Ended 2019”). The decrease of $1,896,000, or 1.1%, was primarily due to the decrease in premiums from our commercial lines business as result of our decision in July 2019 to no longer underwrite this line of business. Direct written premiums from our personal lines business in Year Ended 2020 were $162,184,000, an increase of $12,264,000, or 8.2%, from $149,920,000 in Year Ended 2019.
Beginning in 2017 we started writing homeowners policies in New Jersey. Through 2019 we expanded to Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the business outside of New York as our “Expansion” business. Direct written premiums from our Expansion business were $33,914,000 in Year Ended 2020, an increase of $8,267,000, or 32.2% compared to $25,647,000 in Year Ended 2019.
Net Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned
Through June 30, 2019, our quota share reinsurance treaties were on a July 1 through June 30 fiscal year basis. Effective December 15, 2019, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 15, 2019 through December 30, 2020 (“2019/2020 Treaty”). Our personal lines quota share reinsurance treaty in effect for Year Ended 2019 was covered through June 30, 2019 (together with the run-off period) under a treaty covering a two-year period from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 (“2017/2019 Treaty”). The treaty in effect during Year Ended 2019 was covered through June 30, 2019 (together with the run-off period) under the July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 treaty year (“2018/2019 Treaty Year”). The following table describes the quota share reinsurance ceding rates in effect for each treaty year during Year ended 2020 and Year Ended 2019 under the 2019/2020 Treaty and the 2017/2019 Treaty, respectively. This table should be referred to in conjunction with the discussions for net written premiums, net premiums earned, ceding commission revenue and net loss and loss adjustment expenses that follow.
(1)
The 2018/2019 Treaty Year, covered under the 2017/2019 Treaty, expired on a run-off basis effective July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the “2019 Run-off”).
(2)
The 2019/2020 Treaty was effective December 15, 2019 with a quota share reinsurance rate of 25%.
See “Reinsurance” below for changes to our personal lines quota share treaty effective December 15, 2019, and July 1, 2019 and 2018.
Net written premiums increased $1,484,000, or 1.2%, to $127,063,000 in Year Ended 2020 from $125,579,000 in Year Ended 2019. Net written premiums include direct and assumed premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe). The increase in net written premiums in Year Ended 2020 was attributable to the inception of the 2019/2020 Treaty on December 15, 2019 on a cut-off basis (see table above) and the decrease in commercial lines premiums, which are not subject to a quota share treaty. In Year Ended 2020, our premiums ceded under quota share treaties in force increased by $25,627,000 over the comparable ceded premiums in Year Ended 2019. Our personal lines business was subject to the 2019/2020 Treaty from December 15, 2019 through December 30, 2020. Our personal lines business was subject to the 2017/2019 Treaty under the 2018/2019 Treaty Year through June 30, 2019. Following June 30, 2019, any earned premium and associated claims for policies still in force continued to be ceded under the 10% quota share rate until such policies expired (run-off) over the next year. The 2019 run-off period was from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 and there was no return of unearned premiums under this arrangement.
Excess of loss reinsurance treaties
An increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Year Ended 2020, our ceded excess of loss reinsurance premiums increased by $128,000 over the comparable ceded premiums for Year Ended 2019. The increase was due to an increase in premiums subject to excess of loss reinsurance.
Catastrophe reinsurance treaty
Most of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business gives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase. This results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties provided that reinsurance rates are stable or are increasing. In Year Ended 2020, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties increased by $4,624,000 over the comparable ceded premiums in Year Ended 2019. The change was due to an increase in our catastrophe limit purchased through June 30, 2020, partially offset by a decrease in our limit effective July 1, 2020and an increase in reinsurance rates effective July 1, 2019. Through June 30, 2020, our ceded catastrophe premiums were paid based on the total direct written premiums subject to the catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Effective July 1, 2020, and continuing through June 30, 2021, our ceded catastrophe premiums will be paid based on the total insured value of our risks calculated as of August 31, 2021.
Net premiums earned
Net premiums earned decreased $19,543,000, or 15.3%, to $108,081,000 in Year Ended 2020 from $127,624,000 in Year Ended 2019. The decrease was due to the inception of the 2019/2020 Treaty on December 15, 2019 and the decrease in commercial lines premiums, which are not subject to a quota share treaty. The expired 2017/2019 Treaty under the 2018/2019 Treaty Year was in run-off through June 30, 2020.
Ceding Commission Revenue
The following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:
Ceding commission revenue was $14,202,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $4,651,000 in Year Ended 2019. The increase of $9,551,000, or 205.4%, was due to an increase in both provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned. The increase in provisional ceding commissions occurred due to the increase in quota share reinsurance rates effective December 15, 2019 (see below for discussion of provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned).
Provisional Ceding Commissions Earned
We receive a provisional ceding commission based on ceded written premiums. The $8,673,000 increase in provisional ceding commissions earned is primarily due to the increase in the quota share ceding rate effective December 15, 2019 to 25%, from the 10% rate in effect for part of Year Ended 2019. There was an increase in ceded premiums in Year Ended 2020 available from which to earn ceding commissions compared to Year Ended 2019 due to the changes in quota share ceding rates, the elimination of the 10% quota share treaty on effective July 1, 2019, and an increase in personal lines direct written premiums subject to the quota share.
Contingent Ceding Commissions Earned
The 2019/2020 Treaty and 2017/2019 Treaty structure calls for a higher upfront provisional ceding commission and there is not an opportunity to earn additional contingent ceding commissions under these treaties. The amount of contingent ceding commissions we are eligible to receive under our prior years’ quota share treaties is subject to change based on losses incurred related to claims with accident dates before July 1, 2017. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to the losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we receive.
Net Investment Income
Net investment income was $6,506,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $6,869,000 in Year Ended 2019, a decrease of $363,000, or 5.3%. The average yield on invested assets was 3.39% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 3.51% as of December 31, 2019.
Cash and invested assets were $222,314,000 as of December 31, 2020 compared to $231,700,000 as of December 31, 2019. The $9,386,000 decrease in cash and invested assets was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating cash flows for the Year Ended 2020.
Net Gains and Losses on Investments
Net gains on investments were $1,591,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to net gains of $4,591,000 in Year Ended 2019. Unrealized gains on our equity securities and other investments in Year Ended 2020 were $758,000, compared to unrealized gains of $4,562,000 in Year Ended 2019. Realized gains on sales of investments were $832,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to realized gains of $29,000 in Year Ended 2019.
Other Income
Other income was $990,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $1,385,000 in Year Ended 2019. The decrease of $395,000, or 28.5%, was primarily due to a decrease in finance and service charges during Year Ended 2020.
Net Loss and LAE
Net loss and LAE was $66,431,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $90,182,000 in Year Ended 2019. The net loss ratio was 61.5% in Year Ended 2020 compared to 70.7% in Year Ended 2019, a decrease of 9.2 percentage points.
The following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components excluding commercial lines business:
(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)
The net loss ratio was 61.5% for Year Ended 2020. Despite the significant impact from Tropical Storm Isaias in August, the loss ratio for Year Ended 2020 still improved 9.2 points, from 70.7% in Year Ended 2019. The loss ratio improved due to several factors, including a reduced impact from prior year loss development and an improvement in underlying loss ratio driven by reduced severity.
Prior year development was stable for Year Ended 2020, with minimal impact on the overall loss ratio. This compared to 8.7 points of unfavorable impact in Year Ended 2019, which was primarily related to adverse loss development from commercial lines business of which there were no in-force policies as of December 31, 2020.
The impact of catastrophe losses was larger in Year Ended 2020. The total catastrophe loss ratio for Year Ended 2020 was 10.7 points, compared to 6.0 points for Year Ended 2019. During Tropical Storm Isaias we incurred $8.125 million of losses, or a 7.5-point impact on the overall loss ratio. There were 13 PCS catastrophe events (excluding Tropical Storm Isaias) during Year Ended 2020, with a 3.2-point impact on the overall loss ratio compared to 9 PCS catastrophe events during Year Ended 2019 with a 6.0-point impact on the overall loss ratio as noted above.
The underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding impact of catastrophe and prior year development) was 50.7% for Year Ended 2020, a decrease of 5.3 points from the 56.0% underlying loss ratio for Year Ended 2019. The improvement was primarily due to reduced severity and our exit from the commercial liability lines of business. Excluding commercial lines, the underlying loss ratio improved 3.3 points to 49.8% for Year Ended 2020 compared to from 53.1% for Year Ended 2019.
Commission Expense
Commission expense was $31,828,000 in Year Ended 2020 or 18.8% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $30,093,000 in Year Ended 2019 or 18.8% of direct earned premiums. The increase of $1,735,000 is primarily due to the increase in direct earned premiums in Year Ended 2020 as compared to Year Ended 2019.
Other Underwriting Expenses
Other underwriting expenses were $25,425,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $24,420,000 in Year Ended 2019. The increase of $1,005,000, or 4.1%, was primarily due to expenses related to growth in personal lines direct written premiums and salaries. Expenses directly related to the increase in personal lines direct written premiums primarily consist of underwriting expenses, software usage fees, and state premium taxes. Expenses indirectly related to the increase in personal lines direct written premiums primarily consist of salaries along with related other employment costs.
Our largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $10,830,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $10,358,000 in Year Ended 2019. The increase of $472,000, or 4.6%, was less than the 8.2% increase in personal lines direct written premiums. The increase in employment costs was attributable to the hiring of additional highly experienced management and separation payments to terminated employees, offset by staff reductions.
Our net underwriting expense ratio in Year Ended 2020 was 38.9% compared to 38.0% in Year Ended 2019. The following table shows the individual components of our net underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated:
The overall 9.5 percentage point increase in the benefit from ceding commissions was driven entirely by the change in our quota share ceding rates and its impact on provisional ceding commission revenue. The components of our net underwriting expense ratio related to other underwriting expenses, other income and commissions increased in all categories due to less retention beginning with the inception of the 2019/2020 Treaty on December 15, 2019, resulting in an overall 0.9 percentage point increase in the net underwriting expense ratio.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses, related to the expenses of our holding company and Cosi, were $4,283,000 for Year Ended 2020 compared to $3,835,000 for Year Ended 2019. The increase in Year Ended 2020 of $448,000, or 11.7%, as compared to Year Ended 2019 was primarily due to increases in equity compensation. The increase in equity compensation was due to an annual restricted stock award pursuant to the employment agreement with Barry B. Goldstein, our Chief Executive Officer. Executive bonus compensation is accrued pursuant to the employment agreement in effect through December 31, 2022, however, no bonus expense was accrued for Year Ended 2020.The bonus, when applicable, is a one-time payment computed at the end of the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and as of December 31, 2019 the three-year computation did not meet the required terms of profitability, resulting in no payment and a reversal of the $698,000 previously accrued.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization was $2,865,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $2,546,000 in Year Ended 2019. The increase of $319,000, or 12.5%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation of our new systems platform for handling business being written in Expansion states, newly purchased assets used to upgrade our systems infrastructure.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in Year Ended 2020 and Year Ended 2019 was $1,826,000. We incurred interest expense in connection with our $30.0 million issuance of long-term debt in December 2017.
Income Tax Benefit
Income tax benefit in Year Ended 2020 was $2,260,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 175.5%. Income tax benefit in Year Ended 2019 was $1,816,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 23.3%. Loss before taxes was $1,288,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to loss before taxes of $7,783,000 in Year Ended 2019. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law, allowing for a five year carryback of 2019 NOL’s. We elected on our 2019 federal income tax return to carry back the 2019 NOL of $9,737,000 to tax years 2014 and 2015. The corporate tax rate in 2014 and 2015 was 34%, compared to the corporate tax rate of 21% in 2019. We will also elect on our 2020 federal income tax return to carry back the 2020 NOL of $5,715,000 to tax year 2015. The corporate tax rate in 2015 was 34%, compared to the corporate tax rate of 21% in 2020.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income was $972,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to a net loss of $5,967,000 in Year Ended 2019. The increase in net income of $6,939,000, or 116.3%, was due to the circumstances described above, which caused the decrease in our net loss ratio and increase in ceding commission, partially offset by the decrease in our net premiums earned, other underwriting and operating expenses, depreciation and amortization.

Other Investments
Pursuant to the definition of “Fair Value Measurement,” set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification 820 “Fair Value Measurement” (“ASC 820”), an entity is permitted, as a practical expedient, to estimate the fair value of an investment within the scope of ASC 820 using the net asset value (“NAV”) per share (or its equivalent) of the investment. The following table presents a breakdown of the cost, estimated fair value, and gross gain of our other investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:

A summary of the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our investments in held-to-maturity securities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is shown below:
Credit Rating of Fixed-Maturity Securities
The table below summarizes the credit quality of our available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 as rated by Standard and Poor’s (or, if unavailable from Standard and Poor’s, then Moody’s or Fitch):
The table below details the average yield by type of fixed-maturity security as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The table below lists the weighted average maturity and effective duration in years on our fixed-maturity securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Fair Value Consideration
As disclosed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, with respect to “Fair Value Measurements,” we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities between market participants (an “exit price”). The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources (“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable (“unobservable inputs”). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority (“Level 1”), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities (“Level 2”), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity’s estimates of the assumption that market participants would use, having the lowest priority (“Level 3”). As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 81% and 80%, respectively, of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.
The table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
There were 16 securities at December 31, 2020 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. There were 39 securities at December 31, 2019 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary included the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and management’s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
The primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions from our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds are used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance commissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other underwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the primary source of cash flow for our holding company was the dividends received from KICO, subject to statutory restrictions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, KICO paid dividends of $6,000,000 to us.
KICO is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”), which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding through FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized; eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY includes residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements - Investments, for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net admitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is September 30, 2020, and are due and payable within 90 days of borrowing. The maximum allowable advance as of December 31, 2020, based on the net admitted assets as of September 30, 2020, was approximately $12,066,000. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available collateral, which was approximately $9,682,000 as of December 31, 2020. There were no borrowings under this facility during the year ended December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, invested assets and cash in our holding company was approximately $2,783,000. If the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company cash requirements, we will seek to obtain additional financing.
Our reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operations is generally influenced by the collection of premiums in advance of paid losses, the timing of reinsurance, issuing company settlements and loss payments.
Cash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are shown in the following table:
Net cash used in operating activities was $10,235,000 in Year Ended 2020 as compared to net cash provided by $29,859,000 in Year Ended 2019. The $40,094,000 decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in Year Ended 2020 was primarily a result of a decrease in cash arising from net fluctuations in assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $16,065,000. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities of KICO as affected by growth or declines in its operations, payments on claims and changes in quota share ceding rates which are described above.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $581,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to net cash used of $14,974,000 in Year Ended 2019. The $15,555,000 increase in net cash flows for investing activities was the result of a $25,016,000 increase in the sale of invested assets and a $10,073,000 decrease in sales or maturities of invested assets.
Net cash used in financing activities was $3,274,000 in Year Ended 2020 compared to $3,632,000 used in Year Ended 2019. The $358,000 decrease in net cash used in financing activities was attributable to a $1,544,000 reduction in dividends paid, partially offset by $1,183,000 purchases of treasury stock in Year Ended 2020 compared to Year Ended 2019.
Reinsurance
The following table provides summary information with respect to each reinsurer that accounted for more than 10% of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2020:
Reinsurance recoverable from Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited is secured pursuant to a collateralized trust agreement. Assets held in the trust are not included in our invested assets and investment income earned on this asset is credited to the reinsurer.
Through June 30, 2019, our quota share reinsurance treaties were on a July 1 through June 30 fiscal year basis. Effective December 15, 2019, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 15, 2019 through December 30, 2020 (“2019/2020 Treaty”). Effective December 31, 2020, the 2019/2020 Treaty expired on a cut off basis; this treaty was not renewed.
Our quota share reinsurance treaties in effect during Year Ended 2020 and 2019 for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of homeowners’ policies, were covered under the 2019/2020 Treaty and under a treaty covering a two-year period from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 (“2017/2019 Treaty”). The 2017/2019 Treaty was in run-off effective from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (run-off period). The treaty in effect during Year Ended 2019 through June 30, 2019 (together with the run-off period) was covered under the July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 treaty year (“2018/2019 Treaty Year”).
Effective July 1, 2019, our 2017/2019 Treaty and commercial umbrella treaty expired on a run-off basis; these treaties were not renewed. We entered into new excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties effective July 1, 2020. Material terms for our reinsurance treaties in effect for the treaty years shown below are as follows:
(1)
For personal lines, includes the addition of an automatic facultative facility allowing KICO to obtain homeowners single risk coverage up to $10,000,000 in total insured value, which covers direct losses from $3,500,000 to $10,000,000.
(2)
Plus losses in excess of catastrophe coverage. For the period July 1, 2020 through December 30, 2020, there was no reinsurance coverage for the $2,500,000 gap between quota share limit of $7,500,000 and first $10,000,000 layer of catastrophe coverage (see note (7) below).
(3)
Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. Duration of 168 consecutive hours for a catastrophe occurrence from windstorm, hail, tornado, hurricane and cyclone.
(4)
For the period July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, reinstatement premium protection for $210,000,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of $5,000,000.
(5)
For the period July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, reinstatement premium protection for $292,500,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of $7,500,000.
(6)
For the period July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, reinstatement premium protection for $70,000,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of $10,000,000.
(7)
The personal lines quota share (homeowners, dwelling fire and canine legal liability) expired on December 30, 2020; reinsurance coverage from December 31, 2020 through June 30, 2021 is only for excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance.
Inflation
Premiums are established before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts. We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves, especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.
Fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, or liquidity that are material to investors.
