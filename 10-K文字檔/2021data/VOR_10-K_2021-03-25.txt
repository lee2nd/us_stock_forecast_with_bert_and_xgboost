Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Annual Report”). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors,” our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a cell therapy company combining a novel patient engineering approach with targeted therapies to provide a single company solution for patients suffering from hematological malignancies. Leveraging our expertise in hematopoietic stem cell (“HSC”) biology and genome engineering, we genetically modify HSCs to remove surface targets expressed by cancer cells and then provide these cells as stem cell transplants to patients. Once these cells engraft into bone marrow, we will have engineered the patient such that their HSCs and their blood cell progeny are designed to be treatment resistant to targeted therapies, which we believe will unlock the potential of these targeted therapies to selectively destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy cells. As a result, our engineered HSCs (“eHSCs”) are designed to limit the on-target toxicities associated with these targeted therapies, which we refer to as companion therapeutics, thereby enhancing their utility and broadening their applicability.
We are developing our lead eHSC product candidate, VOR33, and our companion therapeutic, VCAR33, which together, we believe, have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and other hematological malignancies. We use genome engineering technology to remove CD33 surface targets from HSCs to create VOR33. Our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for VOR33 in patients with AML was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in January 2021, and we intend to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1/2a trial of VOR33 in AML patients in combination with Mylotarg by enrolling the first patient in the second quarter of 2021. We expect initial data from this trial to be reported in late 2021 or in the first half of 2022. If successful, this trial will provide important validating evidence of the potential of VOR33 and our broader eHSC approach, which we believe has significant potential to improve clinical outcomes for hematological malignancies beyond AML and change the standard of care. We are developing VOR33 as an eHSC product candidate to replace the standard of care in transplant settings. Once the VOR33 cells have engrafted, we believe patients can be treated with anti-CD33 therapies, such as Mylotarg or VCAR33, with limited on-target toxicity, leading to durable anti-tumor activity and potential cures. In preclinical studies, we have observed that the removal of CD33 provided robust protection of these healthy donor HSCs from the cytotoxic effects of CD33-directed companion therapeutics yet had no deleterious effects on the differentiation or function of hematopoietic cells.
VCAR33 is a CD33-directed chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”)-T therapy candidate designed to target CD33, a clinically-validated target for AML. We licensed VCAR33 from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and intend to initially develop VCAR33 as a bridge-to-transplant monotherapy for relapsed/refractory AML, where patients have failed prior lines of therapy and need further treatment to achieve morphologic remission and, if possible, subsequent HSCT. This setting typically sources T cells from the patient (autologous cells) and is the setting in which the National Marrow Donor Program (“NMDP”) is currently evaluating a T cell therapy using the same CAR construct as VCAR33 in a multi-site Phase 1/2 clinical trial in young adult and pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory AML, with initial monotherapy proof-of-concept data expected in 2022, depending on the investigator’s timing of data release. We expect to either assume sponsorship and oversight of the NMDP trial prior to its completion or enter into an agreement with the NMDP providing us with the right to cross-reference the trial results in future IND applications that we may submit to the FDA. In the event we cross-reference these trial results in an IND application for VCAR33, we will be required to demonstrate that VCAR33 is comparable to the T cell therapy studied in the NMDP trial, which will require us to show that our manufacturing processes and construct release specifications are sufficiently comparable to those employed in the NMDP trial. In determining comparability, we expect the FDA to evaluate whether and to what extent any changes in our process and specifications are likely to have an adverse effect on the quality, safety and efficacy of VCAR33 in comparison to the T cell therapy studied in the NMPD trial. We believe the T cell therapy being evaluated in the NMDP trial is
comparable to VCAR33 and that the trial, if successful, will support future clinical development of VCAR33. Therefore, unless the context requires otherwise, we refer to this program, collectively, as VCAR33. However, the FDA may reject our claim of comparability and the sufficiency of the data to support it, or disagree with our ability to reference the preclinical, manufacturing or clinical data generated by the NMDP trial, and as a result, we may be required to repeat certain development steps undertaken in the NMDP trial if VCAR33 is considered not comparable to its construct. See “Risk Factors-We have not successfully tested our product candidates in clinical trials and any favorable preclinical results are not predictive of results that may be observed in clinical trials.”
We believe VOR33 and VCAR33 could be highly synergistic as a treatment system, potentially enabling prolonged remissions or cures in the post-transplant setting, which we refer to as the VOR33/VCAR33 Treatment System. We intend to investigate the VOR33/VCAR33 Treatment System, entailing VOR33 eHSC therapy followed by VCAR33 as a companion therapeutic, initially for transplant-eligible patients suffering from AML. We believe VCAR33 could be a potent anticancer therapy that, when combined with VOR33, could help obviate severe on-target myeloablative toxicities and unlock the efficacy potential of VCAR33. In addition, in this setting VCAR33 T cells could be sourced from the same cell source as VOR33 (allogeneic cells), which may provide benefits such as a healthier, more abundant cell source alongside lower risk of host T cells attacking CAR-T cells, thereby potentially prolonging persistence. We expect to submit an IND for the VOR33/VCAR33 Treatment System in the second half of 2022 following data from our first-in-human trial evaluating VOR33 and the NMDP-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial studying VCAR33.
Leveraging our proprietary Vor platform, we are also assessing the potential of generating eHSCs in which the expression of other common surface targets has been removed, including targets such as CD123 and CLL-1. We are generating eHSCs in which these genes have been inactivated individually as well as multiplexed in combination with CD33. Additionally, we are conducting ongoing discovery efforts on undisclosed targets for non-myeloid malignancies including multiple myeloma and T cell malignancies. For additional details on the license from NIH, see the section titled “Business-License Agreements.”
In contrast to other patient-specific cell therapies such as CAR-T cells and gene-modified allogeneic cell therapies, our manufacturing of eHSCs is a rapid and elegant process, with the gene modification step for VOR33 being completed in approximately three days. The primary reason we can produce eHSCs so quickly is the lack of a need for cell expansion. Our approach to creating eHSCs also does not involve the insertion of new genetic material, thereby avoiding complications related to the use of delivery modalities necessary for gene insertion, such as the viral vectors used in VCAR33 and other CAR-T therapies. The relatively simple and streamlined process of creating our eHSCs provides significant advantages in the required manufacturing infrastructure and resources, which we believe will translate into higher scalability and a lower cost of goods. We believe rapid manufacturing time will also maximize the clinical application of our eHSCs in routine transplant practice.
Since our inception in December 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to raising capital, organizing and staffing our company, business and scientific planning, conducting discovery and research activities, acquiring or discovering product candidates, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, developing and progressing our product candidates and preparing for clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and component materials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Through December 31, 2020, we funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt financings and have received aggregate net proceeds from these transactions of approximately $112.3 million.
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, including net losses of $43.3 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $61.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, particularly if and as we continue to invest in our research and development activities, expand our product pipeline, hire additional personnel, invest in and grow our business, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio, and seek regulatory approvals for and commercialize any approved product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, audit, accounting, regulatory, tax-related, director and
officer insurance premiums, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the public or private sale of equity, government or private party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or any commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. If we raise funds through strategic collaborations or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our platform technology, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other events. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $48.5 million. In February 2020, we closed the second tranche of our Series A-2 preferred stock financing and sold and issued an aggregate of 44,375,000 shares at a purchase price of $0.40 per share, resulting in proceeds of $17.7 million, net of issuance costs. In June 2020, we completed a closing for the sale and issuance of an aggregate of 124,519,220 shares of our Series B preferred stock at a purchase price of $0.52 per share, resulting in proceeds of $64.5 million, net of issuance costs. In January 2021, we closed the second and final tranche of our Series B preferred stock financing, selling an aggregate of 87,259,605 additional shares of our Series B preferred stock at a purchase price of $0.52 per share (the “Series B Milestone Financing”) for aggregate proceeds of $45.4 million, net of issuance costs.
On February 9, 2021, we completed our IPO and sold 11,302,219 shares of our common stock, including 1,474,202 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, at a public offering price of $18.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $186.3 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions and other offering expenses paid by us.
Business Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. To date our financial condition and operations have not been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot, at this time, predict the specific extent, duration or full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition and operations, including our ongoing and planned preclinical and clinical trials. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 on our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans remains uncertain and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our clinical trial enrollment, trial sites, contract research organizations (“CROs”), third-party manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we do business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. To the extent possible, we are conducting business as usual, with necessary or advisable modifications to employee travel as many of our employees are working remotely. We will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to COVID-19 and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business. The development of our product candidates could be disrupted and materially adversely affected in the future by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our planned clinical trials also could be delayed due to government orders and site policies on account of the pandemic, and some patients may be unwilling or unable to travel to study sites, enroll in our trials or be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, which would delay our ability to conduct clinical trials or release clinical trial results and could delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, COVID-19 could affect our employees or the employees of research sites and service providers on whom we rely, including CROs, as well as those of companies with which we do business, including our suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), thereby disrupting our business operations. Quarantines and travel
restrictions imposed by governments in the jurisdictions in which we and the companies with which we do business operate could materially impact the ability of employees to access preclinical and clinical sites, laboratories, manufacturing site and office. These and other events resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts for VOR33, VCAR33, the VOR33/VCAR33 Treatment System or any other product candidates are successful and result in marketing approval, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such agreements.
Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of external and internal costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of VOR33 and VCAR33.
External expenses include:
•
external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and other scientific development services;
•
costs of other outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses;
•
costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements;
•
costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring and developing preclinical and clinical trial materials, including expenses associated with our CMOs; and
•
payments made under third party licensing agreements.
Internal expenses include:
•
personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, for individuals involved in research and development activities; and
•
facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, insurance and other internal operating costs.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid expenses or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track by stage of development, preclinical or clinical. However, we do not track our internal research and development
expenses on a program specific basis because these costs are deployed across multiple projects and, as such, are not separately classified.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we continue to identify and develop product candidates, particularly as more of our product candidates move into clinical development and later stages of clinical development.
The successful development of VOR33, VCAR33, the VOR33/VCAR33 Treatment System and any product candidates we may develop in the future is highly uncertain. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of VOR33, VCAR33, the VOR33/VCAR33 Treatment System or potential future product candidates, if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, many of which are outside of our control, including the uncertainty of:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•
establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies;
•
the number of sites and patients included in the clinical trials;
•
the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted;
•
per patient trial costs;
•
successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation of, clinical trials, as well as drop out or discontinuation rates, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic environment;
•
the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the number of trials required for regulatory approval;
•
the timing, receipt and terms of any regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•
the performance of our future collaborators, if any;
•
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
•
significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;
•
the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic environment;
•
obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
•
launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•
maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the
completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. We may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for individuals involved in our executive, finance, corporate, business development and administrative functions, as well as expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit, accounting and tax-related services and other consulting fees, facility-related expenses, which include depreciation costs and other allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance costs, recruiting costs, travel expenses and other general administrative expenses.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our business expands and we hire additional personnel to support our continued research and development activities, including our future clinical programs. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs for legal, audit, accounting, investor and public relations, regulatory and tax-related services related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), listing standards applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents held in financial institutions.
Interest Expense Related to Convertible Notes
Interest expense relates to interest incurred on the convertible notes we issued between October 2016 and December 2018 (the “Convertible Notes”), as well as amortization of the related note discount which converted to shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock in February 2019 (see Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this in this Annual Report for additional information).
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities
Change in fair value of derivative liabilities relates to the bifurcated embedded derivative liabilities identified associated with the Convertible Notes.

Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
(1)
In future periods when clinical trial expenses are incurred, we expect that external costs will be broken out between our clinical programs and our preclinical programs.
Research and development expenses were approximately $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of approximately $25.4 million was primarily due to an increase of $14.9 million in external preclinical studies, research consulting fees, and laboratory supplies costs and an increase of $8.2 million in personnel costs primarily attributable to an increase in employee headcount to support the growth of our research and development efforts. Additionally, facilities and other expenses increased by approximately $2.3 million primarily due to increases in rent and depreciation expense.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of approximately $7.5 million was primarily due to an increase of $3.8 million in personnel costs attributable to increased employee headcount to support the growth of our research and development organization, an increase of $2.4 million in professional fees primarily attributable to legal and outside consultant costs and an increase of $1.3 million in facilities and other expenses primarily due to increases in rent expense and purchases of office equipment and supplies.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) changed by $0.5 million from other expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to other income of $29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million decrease in interest expense incurred on the Convertible Notes offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in interest income related to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have not recognized any revenue and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt financings and have received aggregate net proceeds from these transactions of approximately $112.3 million as of December 31, 2020.
In January 2021, we completed the Series B Milestone Financing, selling an aggregate of 87,259,605 additional shares of our Series B preferred stock at a purchase price of $0.52 per share for aggregate net proceeds of $45.4 million.
On February 9, 2021, we completed our IPO and sold 11,302,219 shares of our common stock, including 1,474,202 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, at a public offering price of $18.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $186.3 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering expenses paid by us.
Funding Requirements
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $48.5 million. We will need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our future operations. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funding or that if we do obtain additional funding, that such funding, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.
We expect that the net proceeds from our IPO and the Series B Milestone Financing, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect.
We expect our expenses to increase substantially if, and as, we:
•
initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including in particular our clinical trials for VOR33 and VCAR33;
•
incur third party manufacturing costs to support our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates and, if approved, their commercialization;
•
seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;
•
make investments in our platform, including the costs of developing internal manufacturing capabilities;
•
seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates;
•
adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements to applicable marketed products;
•
acquire or in-license products, product candidates, technologies;
•
maintain, expand, enforce, defend and protect our intellectual property;
•
hire additional clinical, quality control, manufacturing and other scientific personnel;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and
•
experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, audit, accounting, investor and public relations, regulatory, tax-related, director and officer insurance premiums, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that we do not expect to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the public or private sale of equity, government or private party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or any commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. If we raise funds through strategic collaborations or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our platform technology, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, and there is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting a net loss of approximately $43.3, partially offset by a net change of $4.3 million in our net operating assets and non-cash charges of $2.7 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, non-cash lease expense of $0.8 million and depreciation expense of $0.6 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of $5.8 million, an increase in other assets of $2.5 million and an increase in operating lease liability of $0.4 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.6 million.
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a net loss of $10.8 million, partially offset by a net change of $0.1 million in our net operating assets and non-cash charges of $0.8 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of non-cash interest expense of $0.6 million and stock-based compensation expense $0.2 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 million, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.1 million.
The approximately $26.4 million increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a result of our increased efforts towards identifying product candidates and advancing the development of VOR33, including increased personnel costs related to our increased headcount.
Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of shares of our preferred stock. Net cash provided by financing activities was $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of shares of our preferred stock.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
In December 2019, we entered into an operating lease for corporate office and laboratory space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and began occupying the space in June 2020 under a lease agreement that expires in June 2030. Future minimum lease commitments under this lease through June 2030 are $28.0 million. In March 2020, we entered into an operating lease for certain animal care space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and began occupying the space in April 2020 under a lease agreement that expires in March 2022. Future minimum lease commitments under this lease through March 22 are $0.3 million.
We have entered into license agreements with certain parties. Such arrangements require ongoing payments, including payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, receipt of sublicense income, as well as royalties on commercial sales. Payments under these arrangements are expensed as incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred expenses of $0.1 million in milestone payments under our license agreement with the Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York. We also incurred $0.4 million in license issue fees associated with our license with the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health during the year ended December 31, 2020. This summary does not include payments that may become due under these agreements as they are cancellable at will with 90 days’ notice.
We also have agreements with certain vendors for various services, including services related to clinical operations and support, which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience and avoid any and all future obligations to the vendors. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. The exact amounts of
such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated. We do not include these payments in this summary as they are not fixed and estimable.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
Determination of the Fair Value of Equity-Based Awards
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to directors, employees and non-employees based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have only issued stock options and restricted share awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We determine the fair value of restricted stock awards granted based on the fair value of our common stock. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and subjective assumptions we make, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock prior to our IPO, and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we base the estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. The historical volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We use the simplified method to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees and directors. We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For grants to non-employees, ASU 2018-07 allows entities to use the expected term to measure non-employee options or elect to use the contractual term as the expected term, on an award-by-award basis. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. treasury instrument whose term is consistent
with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.
Prior to the IPO, as there had been no public market for our common stock, the estimated fair value of our common stock had been approved by our board of directors, with input from management, as of the date of each award grant, considering our most recently available independent third-party valuations of common stock, and our board of directors assessment, with input from management, of additional objective and subjective factors that we believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These independent third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.
Given the absence of a public trading market, our board of directors with input from management considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of common stock. The factors included, but were not limited to:
•
contemporaneous valuations performed by an independent third-party valuation firm;
•
our stage of development and material risks related to our business;
•
the progress of our research and development programs, including the status and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
our business conditions and projections;
•
sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock;
•
the rights, preferences and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;
•
lack of marketability of our common and redeemable convertible preferred stock as a private company;
•
our operating results and financial performance;
•
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, in light of prevailing market conditions;
•
the trends, developments and conditions in the life sciences and biotechnology industry sectors;
•
analysis of initial public offerings and the market performance and stock price volatility of similar public companies in the life sciences and biopharmaceutical sectors; and
•
the economy in general.
For our valuations performed through June 30, 2020, in accordance with the Practice Aid, we determined the Option Pricing Method (“OPM”) was the most appropriate method for determining the fair value of our common stock based on our stage of development and other relevant factors. The OPM uses a market approach to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. A discount for lack of marketability of the common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.
For our valuations performed after June 30, 2020 through December 31, 2020, in accordance with the Practice Aid, we determined the hybrid method was the most appropriate method for determining the fair value of our common stock based on our stage of development and other relevant factors. The hybrid method also uses a market approach to estimate our enterprise value. It is a probability-weighted expected return method (“PWERM”), where the equity value in one or more scenarios is calculated using an OPM. The PWERM is a scenario-based
methodology that estimates the fair value of our common stock based upon an analysis of our future values, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management's best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we used significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation expense could have been materially different.
See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our stock options granted in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Following completion of the IPO on February 9, 2021, it will no longer be necessary for our board of directors to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for granted stock options and other such awards we may grant, as the fair value of our common stock will be determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We elected the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies.
In addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
•
being permitted to present only two years of audited consolidated financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, with correspondingly reduced disclosure in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”;
•
an exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;
•
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements;
•
exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
•
an exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on consolidated financial statements.
We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will cease to qualify as an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of: (i) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in total annual gross revenues; (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over the prior three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. We have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements in this this Annual Report. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.
We are also a “smaller reporting company.” If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
