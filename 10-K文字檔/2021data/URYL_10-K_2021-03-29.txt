The temporary close down does not have much impact on our current operation, because currently we are in the plantation progress of Aquilaria Subintegra trees and we expect the harvest will take place within 4 years’ time. At this moment, the trees are located at Johor, Malaysia, with sufficient rainfall and sunlight for growing. Once the Movement Control Order is expired or not extended, we will collaborate with our service provider to perform the maintenance work of the farmland.
