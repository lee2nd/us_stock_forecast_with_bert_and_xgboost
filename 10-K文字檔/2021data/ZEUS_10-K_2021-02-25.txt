ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
We are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our specialty metals flat products segment’s focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products, prime tin mill products and fabricated parts. Through the acquisition of Action Stainless. on December 14, 2020, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its geographic footprint and enhanced its product offerings in stainless steel and aluminum plate, sheet, angles, rounds, flat bar, tubing and pipe. Action Stainless offers a range of processing, including plasma, laser and waterjet cutting and CNC machining. Our carbon flat products segment’s focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Through the acquisitions of McCullough and EZ Dumper in 2019, our carbon flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include self-dumping metal hoppers and steel and stainless-steel dump inserts for pickup truck and service truck beds. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets through our tubular and pipe products segment. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada and Mexico. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments’ results.
Our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; transportation and energy costs; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, tariffs, and inventory held in the supply chain; the availability, and increased costs of labor; customers’ ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers’ or our customers’ personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers.
Like other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. From time to time, we have entered into nickel swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers’ risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors’ responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected.
We operate in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products. The carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment are at times consolidated and referred to as the flat products segment. Some of the flat products segments’ assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments’ products are stored in the shared facilities and, in some locations, processed on shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology.
We follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a “management approach” to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.
Due to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments’ average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments. Due to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the LIFO method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels.
Specialty metals flat products
The primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. Through the acquisition of Action Stainless & Alloys, Inc. on December 14, 2020, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its geographic footprint and enhanced its product offerings in stainless steel and aluminum plate, sheet, angles, rounds, flat bar, tubing and pipe. Through its acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include differing types of stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil and prime tin mill products. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.
Carbon flat products
The primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.
Combined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 27 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States.
Tubular and pipe products
The tubular and pipe products segment consists of the CTI business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from eight locations in the Midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force.
Corporate expenses
Corporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors’ expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.
Results of Operations
This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
2020 Compared to 2019
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted people, businesses and economies across the world and the stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders enacted in several U.S. states during 2020 required some businesses to close, or significantly reduce their hours. The stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, and business closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially impacted our results of operations during 2020, primarily during the second and third quarters of 2020.
We are considered an essential business and all of our production facilities and offices remained open in all states. Beginning at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the end of the second quarter, many of our customers, particularly those associated with the automotive industry, temporarily closed their facilities, reduced hours or staggered production schedules. Since the end of the second quarter of 2020, customers have generally re-opened their facilities or increased production levels. Our carbon flat products segment was significantly impacted as automotive and OEM customers were temporarily closed or significantly reduced production levels. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our specialty metals flat products segment and tubular and pipe products segment remained profitable during 2020.
Our results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Metals prices fluctuate significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, are all impacted by industry metals pricing. Metals prices fluctuated significantly during 2020. Prices increased during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the year-end price of 2019, decreased during the second quarter, and then modestly increased during the third quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, prices increased by 64% from the third quarter of 2020 and for some metals we sell, reached record prices at the end of 2020. Prices continue to increase in the first quarter of 2021, which will result in higher selling prices and enhanced margins during the first quarter of 2021. Despite the rapid pricing increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, average metals prices in 2020 were 4% lower than average metals prices in 2019. The lower metals prices are primarily due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on metal demand.
Transactional or “spot” selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while indexed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and, therefore, cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. When average selling prices increase, and net sales increase, gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally decrease.
Consolidated Operations
The following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars shown in thousands):
(a) Includes $1,517 and $3,669 of LIFO income in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Net sales decreased $344.9 million, or 21.8%, to $1.2 billion in 2020 from $1.6 billion in 2019. Carbon flat products net sales decreased $236.6 million, or 25.5%, in 2020 compared to 2019 and were 55.9% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 58.7% in 2019. Specialty metals flat products net sales decreased $50.4 million, or 13.9%, to $313.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019 and were 25.4% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 23.0% in 2019. Tubular and pipe products net sales decreased $57.8 million, or 20.0%, to $230.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019 and were 18.7% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 18.3% of total net sales in 2019. The decrease in sales was due to a 11.1% decrease in sales volume and an 12.1% decrease in average selling prices. Average selling prices in 2020 were $1,110 per ton, compared to $1,263 per ton in 2019. The decrease in the average selling price is a result of the market pricing dynamics discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above.
Cost of materials sold decreased $301.0 million, or 23.5%, to $1.0 billion in 2020 from $1.28 billion in 2019. During 2020, we recorded LIFO income of $1.5 million compared to $3.7 million in 2019. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2020 is primarily related to decreased sales volume and the decreased metals pricing in 2020 compared to 2019.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 20.7% in 2020 from 18.9% in 2019. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2020 was primarily due to the impact of lower average selling prices in 2020 compared to 2019.
Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $27.8 million, or 9.9%, to $254.5 million in 2020 from $282.3 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.6% in 2020 from 17.9% in 2019. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment decreased $19.6 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals flat products segment decreased $3.3 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment decreased $3.5 million, and corporate expenses decreased $1.5 million. Operating expenses decreased in all categories, except depreciation and amortization expenses, due to decreased variable expenses such as distribution, labor expenses, and warehouse expenses associated with the decreased shipping volumes discussed above, decreased performance-based incentive compensation, and our COVID-19 related cost reduction efforts. Operating expenses in 2020 include $3.6 million of restructuring and other charges related to the loss on sale of idled real estate, charges related to the exit from our leased Monterrey, Mexico facility and COVID-19 related severance and bad debt expense, which were recorded to the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments.
Interest and other expense on debt totaled $7.4 million in 2020 compared to $11.3 million in 2019. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 3.25% in 2020 compared to 4.0% in 2019. The decreased effective borrowing rate is due to the decrease in LIBOR compared to 2019. Total average borrowings decreased $69.2 million, or 26.9% to $188.4 million in 2020 from $257.6 million in 2019, primarily related to decreased working capital needs in 2020.
Loss before income taxes totaled $6.9 million in 2020 compared to income before income taxes of $5.3 million in 2019.
An income tax benefit of 19.0% was recorded in 2020, compared to an income tax provision of 27.1% in 2019. The lower rate was primarily attributable to the impact of permanently non-deductible items on a pre-tax loss.
Net loss in 2020 totaled $5.6 million, or $0.49 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $3.9 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share, in 2019.
Segment Results of Operations
Carbon flat products
The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):
(a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Tons sold decreased 113 thousand tons, or 11.1%, to 898 thousand tons in 2020 from 1.01 million tons in 2019. Toll tons sold decreased 19 thousand tons, or 28.1% to 48 thousand tons in 2020 from 67 thousand tons in 2019. Collectively temporary closures, reduced hours and staggered production schedules due to the COVID-19 pandemic, discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above, primarily during the second quarter of 2020, negatively impacted our tons sold during 2020. We expect sales volumes in 2021 to increase over 2020.
Net sales decreased $236.6 million, or 25.5%, to $690.3 million in 2019 from $926.9 million in 2019. Average selling prices in 2020 decreased 16.2% to $769 per ton, compared to $917 per ton in 2019. The decrease in sales was due to an 11.1% decrease in sales volume and a 16.2% decrease in average selling prices.
Cost of materials sold decreased $211.8 million, or 27.7%, to $551.8 million in 2020 from $763.5 million in 2019. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to an 18.7% decrease in metals pricing and an 11.1% decrease in sales volume during 2020 compared to 2019.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 20.1% in 2020 from 17.6% in 2019. The average gross profit per ton sold decreased $8 per ton, or 4.6%, to $154 in 2020 from $162 in 2019.
Operating expenses in 2020 decreased $19.6 million, or 11.6%, to $148.8 million from $168.4 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 21.6% in 2020 from 18.2% in 2019. Operating expenses decreased in all categories, except for depreciation and amortization expenses, due to decreased variable expenses such as distribution expense, labor expenses, and warehouse expenses due to the decreased shipping volumes discussed above, decreased performance-based incentive compensation and our COVID-19 related cost reduction efforts. Operating expenses in 2020 include $3.6 million of restructuring and other charges related to the loss on sale of idled real estate, charges related to the exit from our leased Monterrey, Mexico facility and COVID-19 related severance and bad debt expense.
Operating loss totaled $10.3 million in 2020 compared to $5.0 million in 2019.
Specialty metals flat products
The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):
(a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Tons sold decreased 15 thousand tons, or 10.7%, to 127 thousand tons in 2020 from 142 thousand tons in 2019. The decrease in tons sold in 2020 is related to decreased customer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net sales decreased $50.4 million, or 13.9%, to $313.2 million in 2020 from $363.6 million in 2019. Average selling prices in 2020 decreased to $2,472 per ton, compared to $2,564 per ton in 2019. The decrease in sales was due to the 10.7% decrease in sales volume and a 3.6% decrease in the average selling prices during 2020 compared to 2019.
Cost of materials sold decreased $44.5 million, or 14.3%, to $266.4 million in 2020 from $310.9 million in 2019. The decrease in cost of materials sold was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume in 2020 compared to 2019.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 14.9% in 2020 from 14.5% in 2019. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $369 in 2020 compared to $372 per ton in 2019.
Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased $3.3 million, or 8.6%, to $35.1 million in 2020 from $38.4 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 11.2% of net sales in 2020 from 10.6% in 2019. Variable operating expenses decreased as a result of lower shipping volumes, lower performance-based incentive compensation, and our COVID-19 related cost reduction efforts.
Operating income for 2020 totaled $11.7 million compared to $14.3 million in 2019.
Tubular and pipe products
The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars shown in thousands).
(a) Includes $1,517 and $3,669 of LIFO income in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Net sales decreased $57.8 million, or 20.0%, to $230.7 million in 2020 from $288.5 million in 2019. The decrease in net sales was due to a 10.8% decrease in sales volume and a 10.4% decrease in average selling prices during 2020. The decrease in net sales in 2020 is related to decreased customer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cost of materials sold decreased $44.8 million, or 21.8%, to $160.9 million in 2020 from $205.6 million in 2019. The decrease in cost of materials sold is due to decreased sales volumes and decreased metals pricing. During 2020, we recorded $1.5 million of LIFO income compared to $3.7 million during 2019.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 30.3% in 2020 compared to 28.7%, in 2019. LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.7% of net sales in 2020 compared to 1.3% of net sales in 2019
Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $3.5 million, or 5.4%, to $60.8 million in 2020 from $64.3 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 26.3% in 2020 compared to 22.2% in 2019. Operating expenses decreased in all categories, primarily as a result of lower sales volumes and our COVID-19 related cost reduction efforts.
Operating income for 2020 totaled $9.0 million, compared to $18.6 million in 2019.
Corporate expenses
Corporate expenses decreased $1.5 million, or 13.0%, to $9.8 million in 2020 compared to $11.3 million in 2019. The decreases in corporate expenses are primarily attributable to decreased variable incentive compensation related to decreased operating income and our COVID-19 related cost reduction efforts.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows
Our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs, purchasing, upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities, making acquisitions and paying dividends. We use cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements.
We believe that funds available under our ABL Credit Facility together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, our dividend payments and any share repurchases and business acquisitions over at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may as part of our business strategy, acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures. Accordingly, the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise.
2020 Compared to 2019
Operating Activities
During 2020, we generated $61.7 million of net cash from operations, of which $14.5 million was generated from operating activities and $47.1 million was generated from working capital. Net cash from operations during 2020 was primarily comprised of the $20.0 million addback of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense to the net loss of $5.6 million. During 2019, we generated $129.6 million of net cash from operations, of which $22.8 million was generated from operating activities and $106.8 million was generated from working capital. Net cash from operations during 2019 was primarily comprised of net income of $3.9 million and the addback of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense.
Working capital at December 31, 2020 totaled $275.5 million, a $43.3 million decrease from December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $37.2 million decrease in inventory (resulting from lower inventory levels and lower average inventory costs in 2020 compared to 2019), and a $16.4 million increase in accounts payable and outstanding checks (resulting from increased inventory purchases and higher inventory costs at the end of 2020 compared to 2019) offset by a $14.8 million increase in accounts receivable (resulting primarily from increased sales prices and shipping volumes at the end of 2020 compared to 2019).
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities was $28.1 million during 2020, compared to $21.0 million during 2019. Investment activities in 2020 included the acquisition of Action Stainless for $19.5 million and $9.8 million of capital expenditures, primarily attributable to processing equipment at our existing facilities. Investment activities in 2019 included the acquisitions of McCullough and EZ Dumper for $11.1 million in the aggregate and $10.2 million of capital expenditures, primarily attributable to additional processing equipment at our existing facilities. During 2021, we expect our capital spending to be less than our annual depreciation expense.
Financing Activities
During 2020, $33.6 million of cash was used for financing activities, which primarily consisted of $32.3 million of net repayments under our ABL Credit Facility, and $0.9 million of dividends paid. During 2019, $112.1 million of cash was used for financing activities, which primarily consisted of $109.6 million of net repayments under our ABL Credit Facility, $1.5 million of repurchases of common stock and $0.9 million of dividends paid.
In February 2021, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, which is payable on March 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2021. Our Board previously approved 2020 and 2019 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid in March, June, September and December of 2020 and 2019. Dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash, limitations on cash dividends under our ABL Credit Facility and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders.
Stock Repurchase Program
In 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 550,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated stock repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchased shares will be held in our treasury, or canceled and retired as our Board may determine from time to time. Any repurchases of common stock are subject to the covenants contained in the ABL Credit Facility. Under the ABL Credit Facility, we may repurchase common stock and pay dividends up to $5.0 million in the aggregate during any trailing twelve months without restrictions. Purchases in excess of $5.0 million require us to (i) maintain availability in excess of 20% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($95.0 million as of December 31, 2020) or (ii) to maintain availability equal to or greater than 15% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($71.3 million as of December 31, 2020) and we must maintain a pro-forma ratio of EBITDA, minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and limitations under the ABL Credit Facility, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2020, 360,212 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program.
During 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 15,000 and 109,505 shares, for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively. There were no shares repurchased during 2018.
Debt Arrangements
Our ABL Credit Facility, is collateralized by our accounts receivable inventory and personal property. The ABL Credit Facility consists of (i) a revolving credit facility of $445 million, including a $20 million sub-limit for letters of credit and (ii) a first in, last out revolving credit facility of up to $30 million. Under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility, we may request additional commitments in the aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. Revolver borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base, comprised of eligible receivables and inventories, or $475 million in the aggregate. The ABL Credit Facility matures on December 8, 2022.
The ABL Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and certain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; (iii) make investments; (iv) sell assets; (v) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from restricted subsidiaries to us; (vi) incur liens securing indebtedness; (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, the ABL Credit Facility contains a financial covenant, which requires (i) if any commitments or obligations are outstanding our availability is less than the greater of $30 million or 10.0% of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments ($47.5 million at December 31, 2020) or 10.0% of the aggregate borrowing base ($28.5 million at December 31, 2020) then we must maintain a ratio of Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for the most recent twelve fiscal month period.
We have the option to borrow under its revolver based on the agent’s base rate plus a premium ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or LIBOR plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 2.75%.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our covenants and had approximately $120.7 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2020, $0.9 million of bank financing fees were included in “Prepaid expenses and other” and “Other long-term assets” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The financing fees are being amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Credit Facility and are included in “Interest and other expense on debt” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
On January 10, 2019, we entered into a five-year forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on $75 million of the outstanding LIBOR based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. The interest rate hedge fixed the rate at 2.57%.
Contractual Obligations
The following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020
(a) See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(b) Future interest obligations are calculated using the debt balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2020.
(c) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(c) See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Classification is based on expected settlement dates and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
(d) Consists of retirement liabilities and deferred compensation payable in future years.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (a) made guarantees, (b) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (c) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (d) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company.
Other than derivative instruments discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits, transportation services, processing equipment, purchased metals, energy and borrowings under our credit facility. General inflation, excluding increases in the price of metals and increased labor and distribution expense, has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years.
Critical Accounting Policies
This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid investments, with a three-month or less maturity, which are readily convertible into cash. We maintain cash levels in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced significant loss, and believe we are not exposed to significant risk of loss, in these accounts.
Fair Market Value
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. To measure fair value, we apply a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the credit facility revolver, are stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance, which remains fairly level from year to year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. We cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses each quarter.
Inventory Valuation
Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of its cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonable predictable costs of completion. Inventory costs include the costs of the purchased metals, inbound freight, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs.
Costs of our carbon and specialty metals flat products segments’ inventories, including flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products are determined using the specific identification method.
Certain of our tubular and pipe products inventory is stated under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, approximately $50.3 million, or 21.0% of consolidated inventory, and $39.1 million, or 14.3% of consolidated inventory, respectively, was reported under the LIFO method of accounting. The cost of the remainder of tubular and pipe product segment’s inventory is determined using a weighted average rolling first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
On the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), “Cost of materials sold (exclusive of items shown separately below)” consists of the cost of purchased metals, inbound and internal transfer freight, external processing costs, and LIFO income or expense.
Property and Equipment, and Depreciation
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to 30 years. We capitalize the costs of obtaining or developing internal-use software, including directly related payroll costs. We amortize those costs over five years, beginning when the software is ready for its intended use.
Intangible Assets and Recoverability of Long-lived Assets
The Company performs an annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant nonperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. Management uses judgment to determine whether to use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative fair value measurement for the reporting unit that carries intangible assets.
If a quantitative fair value measurement is used, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology. Management’s assumptions used for the calculations are based on historical results, projected financial information and recent economic events. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, which could adversely affect the reported value of intangible assets.
We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. We record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include, as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. If we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value. We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in normal income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of administrative and general expense.
We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
We had no material unrecognized tax benefits as of or during the year period ended December 31, 2020. We expect no significant increases or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits due to changes in tax positions within one year of December 31, 2020.
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers are comprised of purchase orders with standard terms and conditions. Occasionally we may also have longer-term agreements with customers. Substantially all of the contracts with customers require the delivery of metals, which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied upon transfer of control of the product to the customer.
Transfer of control is assessed based on the use of the product distributed and rights to payment for performance under the contract terms. Transfer of control and revenue recognition for substantially all of our sales occur upon shipment or delivery of the product, which is when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer and is based on the applicable shipping terms. The shipping terms depend on the customer contract. An invoice for payment is issued at time of shipment and terms are generally net 30 days. We have certain fabrication contracts in one business unit for which revenue is recognized over time as performance obligations are achieved. This fabrication business is immaterial to our consolidated results.
Sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs
Amounts charged to customers for shipping and other transportation services are included in net sales. The distribution expense line on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) is entirely comprised of all shipping and other transportation costs incurred by us in shipping goods to its customers.
Stock-Based Compensation
We record compensation expense for stock awards issued to employees and directors. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Account Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” The objective of this ASU is to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in ASC 740 and by clarifying and amending existing guidance within US generally accepted accounting principles, or US GAAP. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Different components of the guidance require retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective adoption, and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this guidance when it becomes effective, in the first quarter of 2021, and the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements is not expected to be material.
In August 2017, FASB issued ASU No 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging.” This ASU aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. To meet that objective, the ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. This ASU also makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance and ease the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements and assessing hedge effectiveness. The adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2019, did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).” which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. The ASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2020 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases,” which specifies the accounting for leases. The objective is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. This ASU introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the guidance impacted our Consolidated Balance Sheets by the creation of right to use assets and lease liabilities. The adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2019, did not have a material impact on our Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) or on the Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
