Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus.
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.
Our audited financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).
Company Overview
We are a development-stage company that intends to provide subscription-based, highly secure expense and earnings tracking application service for personal and corporate use. We have recently commenced business operations and have not generated any revenues to date.
RESULTS OF OPERATION
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has a net loss of $26,022. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has not earned any revenue.
Operating Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred total expenses and professional fees of $26,022 compared to $11,113 during the year ended December 31, 2019. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and increase was due to legal and accounting expenses relating to our 10-Q and 10-K filing statements with the SEC. During the year, we also incurred $11,000 of DTC costs.
Net Loss
Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $26,022 compared to net loss of $11,113 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2020, our total assets were $5,382 compared to $137 in total assets as of December 31, 2019. The increase in assets is connected with the cash proceeds that came from the issuance of common stock to our shareholders.
As of December 31, 2020 and, 2019, our liabilities were $20,225 and $7,365, respectively. The increase is due to additional funds contributed by our President and Director for operations.
Stockholders’ deficit was $14,843 as of December 31, 2020, compared to stockholders’ deficit of $7,228 as of December 31, 2019. The difference was due to operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 which was supported by cash funding from our President and Director as opposed to the issuance of common shares and cash proceeds from our shareholders.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows used in operating activities were $13,770 compared to $6 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $18,407 compared to $50 as of December 31, 2019. Financing for the current year was provided by the issuance of 1,231,000 shares of common stock to our shareholders.
Plan of Operation and Funding
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.
Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
