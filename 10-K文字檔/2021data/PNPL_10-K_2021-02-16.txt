ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Annual Report.
The independent registered public accounting firm’s report on the Company’s financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and for the years then ended, includes a “going concern” explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
Introduction
This Annual Report includes, in one comprehensive filing, the business and financial information for the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018; in addition, and the Company’s financial statements and supplementary data include summarized quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters ended (i) March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2019, and (ii) March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2018. This review should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and supplementary data, which are included in this Annual Report.
The Company has spent the last several years recasting the direction of the Company. We intend to take advantage of the opportunities that have been identified in the cannabis sectors. The market opportunities that are opened to a cannabis company include PVI’s involvement with cannabis delivery, retail, manufacturing, and cultivation. Our main focus has been to receive 40% of all net income generated by PVI from its business ventures, as well as selling the Top Shelf System to cannabis dispensaries.
Our Business
The Company was originally formed in the state of Nevada under the name Global Resources, Ltd. on August 3, 1983. It changed its name to “Helixphere Technologies Inc.” on April 12, 1999 and to “New China Global Inc.” on October 2, 2013. It reincorporated in Wyoming on October 30, 2013 and changed its name to “Globestar Industries” on July 15, 2014. On August 24, 2015, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Better Business Consultants, Inc. (“BBC” dba “MJ Business Consultants”), a corporation formed in California on January 29, 2015, all of BBC’s shareholders, and the Company’s majority shareholder (the “Share Exchange”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange, BBC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon consummation of the Share Exchange, the Company ceased its prior business of providing educational services and continued the business of BBC as its sole line of business. On September 3, 2015, the Company changed its name to “Pineapple Express, Inc.” from “Globestar Industries.” BBC has three wholly owned subsidiaries, Pineapple Express One LLC, a California limited liability company, Pineapple Express Two LLC, a California limited liability company, and Pineapple Properties Investments, LLC, a Washington limited liability company. Better Business Consultants, Inc. has since been sold by the Company.
Subsequent to December 31, 2018, in 2019 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, as amended (the “PVI Agreement”), with PVI and PVI’s stockholders. In connection with the PVI Agreement, the Company acquired a total of 50,000 shares of PVI’s outstanding capital stock, equaling 50% of the outstanding shares of PVI. This amount was reduced to 40% in January 2020. As a result of the PVI acquisition, the Company entered the cannabis cultivation, production and distribution sector throughout California. The Company has several leased properties that are currently being developed to provide these cannabis-related services.
Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”), dated as of April 6, 2020, by and between, Pineapple Express, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“Pineapple Express”), and Pineapple, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Pineapple”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pineapple Express, effective as of April 15, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), Pineapple Express merged with and into Pineapple, with Pineapple being the surviving entity (the “Reincorporation Merger”). The Reincorporation Merger was consummated to complete Pineapple Express’ reincorporation from the State of Wyoming to the State of Nevada. The Merger Agreement, the Reincorporation Merger, the Name Change (as defined below) and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Pineapple were duly approved by the written consent of shareholders of Pineapple Express owning at least a majority of the outstanding shares of PE Common Stock, dated December 18, 2019. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company’s corporate name changed from “Pineapple Express, Inc.” to “Pineapple, Inc.”
The Company is based in Los Angeles, California. Through the Company’s operating subsidiary Pineapple Express Consulting, Inc. (“PEC”), as well as its portfolio asset, PVI the Company provides capital to its canna-business clientele, leases real properties to those canna-businesses, takes equity positions and manages those operations, and provides consulting and technology to develop, enhance, or expand existing and newly formed infrastructures. Pineapple aims to become the leading portfolio management company in the U.S. cannabis sector. The Company’s executive team blends enterprise-level corporate expertise with a combined three decades of experience operating in the tightly-regulated cannabis industry. Pineapple’s strategic asset integration has provided it with the infrastructure to support its subsidiaries with cost-effective access to all segments of the vertical: from cultivation and processing, to distribution, retail and delivery. With its headquarters in in Los Angeles, CA, Pineapple’s portfolio company, PVI, is rapidly increasing its footprint throughout the state and looking to scale into underdeveloped markets. While PVI is generating revenues from the above-mentioned means, PEC is currently still in development and is currently not generating revenues. The Company receives monthly dividends equal to 40% of PVI’s income that provide regular operating cash flows.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States. As a result, significant volatility has occurred in both the United States and International markets. While the disruption is currently expected to be temporary, there is uncertainty around the duration. To date, the Company has experienced declining revenues, difficulty staffing interpreters, difficulty meeting debt covenants, maintaining consistent service quality with reduced revenue, and a loss of customers. Management expects this matter to continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial position, but the ultimate financial impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Year Ended December 31, 2019, as compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Revenue
Revenue from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 was $15,000, which represents an increase of $5,000, or 50% from $10,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue was related to generating 3 months of consulting revenue from PVI in 2019 as compared to 2 months of consulting revenue from PVI in 2019.
Operating Loss from Continuing Operations
Operating loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,616,174, an increase of $632,770, or 64.3%, from an operating loss from continuing operations of $983,404 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. While both revenue and operating expenses increased, the increase in operating expenses was more significant as noted in the discussion of general and administrative expenses below, resulting in an increase of the operating loss.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 were $1,622,545, an increase of $637,769, or 64.7%, from $984,776 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The most significant change was the increase in legal settlements of $466,237. These were offset by a reduction in consultant expense of $214,819. The Company also experienced an overall reduction in operations from 2018 to 2019, but incurred significant legal and professional fees totaling $384,439 related to ongoing legal matters, settlement negotiations, and the cost of completing its SEC reporting that resulted in an overall increase in general and administrative expenses.
Depreciation
Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $8,629 and $8,628, respectively. This is consistent with the depreciable asset base which did not change from 2018 to 2019.
Other Income/Expense
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the Company has total other income of $447,712, consisting of $631,360 of other income from the Mutual Release Agreement, net of $104,775 in losses on settlements of debt, $17,588 in interest expense and $61,285 in losses from the Company’s equity method investment. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had total other expense of $381,737, consisting of a $323,459 gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, net of $129,364 in interest expense, a loss on abandoned projects of $500,000, and a loss on settlement of debt of $75,382.
Net Loss
As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $1,168,462 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a net loss of $1,365,141 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of $10,288,259, $0 in cash, and a $1,000,000 stock subscription receivable. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s current liabilities included $871,528 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $312,182 in accrued interest payable, $2,139,753 in related party notes payable, $19,838 in other notes payable, $784,000 in advances on agreements, $5,940,720 in stock subscriptions payable, $1,000,000 in put option payable, and $140,048 in contingent liabilities. We have funded our operations since inception primarily through the issuance of our equity securities in private placements to third parties and/or promissory notes to related parties for cash. The cash was used primarily for operating activities, including cost of employees, management services, professional fees, consultants and travel. Our management expects that cash from operating activities will not provide sufficient cash to fund normal operations, support debt service, or undertake certain investments we anticipate prosecuting for our business proposition both in the near and intermediate terms. We will continue to rely on financing provided under notes from related and 3rd party sources, as well as sale of shares of our common stock in private placements, to fund our expected cash requirements.
Since December 31, 2019, the Company has utilized cash of $342,460, all of which came in the form of related party on demand loans. We intend to continue raising additional capital through related party loans. Additionally, in 2021 the Company is planning to apply to have its common stock quoted on the OTC Markets, at which point the Company plans to raise money through issuances of debt and/or equity securities in private placements to accredited investors. There can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or will be sufficient to enable us to fully complete our development activities or sustain operations. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead and operations, or scale back our current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.
Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in such consolidated financial statements, we had an accumulated stockholders’ deficit of $13,418,661 as of the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2019 and had a net loss of $1,168,462 and utilized net cash of $252,261 in operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm in their audit report to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern was raised due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our expectation that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we will require additional financing to fund future operations. Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Based on our management’s estimates and expectation to continue to receive short-term debt funding from a related party on as needed basis, we believe that current funds on hand as of the date of issuance and proceeds of such loans will be sufficient for us to continue operations through the year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond through February 28, 2022. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our business strategy and in our ability to raise additional funds. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate our business; however, we can give no assurance that any future financing will be available or, if at all, and if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we can obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity and/or convertible debt financing.
Cash Flows Provided by (Used In) Operating Activities
Operating Activities
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we used $252,261 of cash in operating activities, primarily as a result of our net loss of $1,168,462, net of non-cash operating income of $56,673, including $631,360 in income from the Mutual Release Agreement, net of $104,775 in losses on settlements of debt, $293,900 in stock-based compensation, depreciation expense of $8,629, and a loss from the Company’s equity method investment of $61,285. Operating assets and liabilities increased by $972,874, primarily due to an increase in stock subscriptions payable of $447,320, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $398,526, and increase in contingent liabilities of $69,517, and an increase in accrued interest payable of $13,463. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we used $267,921 of cash in operating activities, primarily as a result of our net loss of $1,365,141, net of non-cash operating expenses of $781,626, including $100,000 in common stock issued for delayed lease obligations, $5,000 in common stock issued for charitable donations, $415,625 in stock-based compensation, depreciation expense of $8,628, a loss on abandoned projects of $500,000, and a loss on the settlement of debt of $75,832, net of a $323,459 gain from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities increased by $315,594, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $181,231 and an increase in accrued interest payable of $129,363.
Investing Activities
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no cash flows from investing activities.
Financing Activities
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we received $252,261 in cash from financing activities, primarily from $387,367 in proceeds from related party notes payable, net of $101,606 in repayments of lease obligations. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we received $245,746 in cash from financing activities, including $165,746 in proceeds from related party notes payable and $85,000 from the sale of common stock, net of $5,000 in repayments of related party notes payable.
Selected Quarterly Results of Operations
The following table shows selected results of operations for each quarter during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Revenue
Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2018.
Revenue from the three months ended September 30, 2018 included a billing of consulting services by the Company’s Pineapple Express Consulting subsidiary at $2,500 to PVI. No such transactions occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2019.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2018.
Neither three-month period had any revenue.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018.
Revenue from the three months ended March 31, 2019 included three monthly billings of consulting services by the Company’s Pineapple Express Consulting subsidiary at $5,000 per month with PVI prior to the Company’s investment in PVI in April 2019, triggering the termination of the Consulting Agreement. No such transactions occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
General and Administrative
Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2018.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $176,035 or 43.3% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018. The most significant decrease is from consultant expense, which decreased $303,150. We noted that the Company recorded stock-based compensation of $250,000 in July 2018 related to Eric Kennedy. There was no significant stock-based compensation during the quarter ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in consultant expense was offset by increases to legal and professional fees of $68,112.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2018.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $377,949 or 214.9% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. The most significant increases are from legal and professional fees, which increased $130,237, and consultant expense, which increased $276,046, due to limited resources to complete the necessary filings with the SEC to be able to raise additional capital and finance future operations. We noted that the Company recorded stock-based compensation of $275,000 in May 2019 related to hiring Shawn Credle as the Company’s CEO. The Company also incurred increased legal fees in general in 2019 in connection with the legal matters discussed above.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased by $62,135 or 33.3% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The most significant decrease is from consultant expense, which decreased $83,801. The decrease in consulting fees primarily comes from certain consultants the Company had been working with in early 2018 towards SEC filings where the relationships ended, and those expenses were no longer incurred.
Depreciation
Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2018.
Depreciation remained consistent between the three months ended September 30, 2019 and the three months ended September 30, 2018.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2018.
Depreciation remained consistent between the three months ended June 30, 2019 and the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018.
Depreciation remained consistent between the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Other Income/Expense
Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2018.
Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $96,671, compared to other income of $283,283 for the three months ended September 30, 2018, a change of $379,954. The increase is primarily attributable to a $336,456 gain recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 from change in fair value of the put liability. We also noted that the Company’s 50% share of the loss from its equity method investment in PVI was $61,128 during the quarter ended September 30, 2019, but the Company had not yet made this investment in 2018.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2018.
Other income for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $121,502 or 33.6% compared to other income for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The most significant impact comes from other income of $631,360 recorded by the Company in May 2019 in connection with the Mutual Release Agreement discussed above, which allowed for the Company to keep prepaid rent of $160,680 and the $470,680 security deposit balance maintained under the terminated lease agreements. This was offset by a loss on settlement of debt of $92,400 and the Company’s 50% share of the loss from its equity method investment in PVI of $20,733 when there was no such investment in 2018. The other income during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 includes a $511,475 gain from the change in fair value of the put liability, offset by a $97,800 loss on settlement of debt and interest expense of $52,493.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018.
Other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $50,510 compared to $228,124 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $177,614 or 77.9%. Other expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 includes interest expense of $35,543 and losses on settlement of debt of $12,375. Other expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included a loss from the change in fair value of the put option of $176,626 and interest expense of $51,498.
Net Income/Loss
Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2018.
Overall, the Company’s net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased by $206,419 or 168.6% compared to net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2018. This results from an offset between higher general and administrative expenses and other income during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2018.
Overall, the Company recorded a net loss of $73,295 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to net income of $183,152 for the three months ended June 30, 2018, a change of $256,447. This results from other income recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2019, reduced by higher general and administrative expenses compared the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018.
Overall, the Company’s net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased by $254,749 or 61.1% compared to net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This primarily results from settlement losses recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 being less than the other expense for the change in fair value of the put option recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2018, along with decreased general and administrative expenses.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, fair value of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, assessment of legal accruals, the fair value of our stock, stock-based compensation and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company periodically issues restricted stock and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for restricted stock and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as stock-based compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Company accounts for restricted stock and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, restricted stock and warrants grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.
The fair value of the Company’s warrant grants, including the put obligation liability from the THC Merger, are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton and Binomial Option Pricing models, which use certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton and Binomial Option Pricing models and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton and Binomial Option Pricing models could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods. In light of the very limited trading of our common stock, market value of the shares issued was determined based on the then most recent price per share at which we sold common stock in a private placement during the periods then ended. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding warrants.
Investments - Equity Method
The Company accounts for equity method investments at cost, adjusted for the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or losses, which are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company periodically reviews the investments for other than temporary declines in fair value below cost and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2019, the Company believes the carrying value of its equity method investments were recoverable in all material respects.
