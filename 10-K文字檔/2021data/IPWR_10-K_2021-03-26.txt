ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis here and throughout this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
Overview
Ideal Power is located in Austin, Texas. Until April 2018, we were primarily focused on the design, marketing and sale of electrical power conversion products using our proprietary technology called Power Packet Switching Architecture™, or PPSA™. PPSA™ is a power conversion technology that improves upon existing power conversion technologies in key product metrics, such as size and weight while providing built-in isolation and bi-directional and multi-port capabilities. PPSA™ utilizes standardized hardware with application specific embedded software. Our products were designed to be used in both on-grid and off-grid applications with a focus on solar + storage, microgrid and stand-alone energy storage applications. The principal products of the Company were 30-kilowatt power conversion systems, including 2-port and multi-port products.
In April 2018, we realigned into two operating divisions: Power Conversion Systems, to continue the commercialization of our PPSA™ technology, and B-TRAN, to develop our Bi-directional bi-polar junction TRANsistor (B-TRAN™) solid state switch technology.
In January 2019, our Board approved a strategic shift to focus on the commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology and a plan to suspend further power converter system, or PPSA™, development and sales while we located a buyer for our power conversion systems division and PPSA™ technology. In September 2019, we closed on the sale of our power conversion systems division and are now solely focused on the further development and commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology. Prior to the sale of our PPSA™ business and technology in September 2019, we classified this division as held for sale. We show this division as a discontinued operation in our financial statements.
To date, operations have been funded primarily through the sale of common stock and warrants. Total revenue generated from inception to date as of December 31, 2020 amounted to $15.3 million with approximately $12.4 million of that revenue from discontinued operations and the remainder from grant revenue for bi-directional power switch development. Revenue from continuing operations was $428,129 and $0 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and related to a government grant. We may pursue additional research and development grants, if and when available, to further develop and/or improve our technology.
Trends, Events and Uncertainties
Research and Development
Research and development of new technologies is, by its nature, unpredictable. We cannot assure you that our research and development will be successful, our technology will be adopted, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional if and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds if and when we need them, we may be required to severely curtail, or even to cease, our operations.
Strategic Shift
In January 2019, our Board approved a strategic shift to focus on the commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology and a plan to suspend further power converter system, or PPSA™, development and sales while we located a buyer for our power conversion systems division and PPSA™ technology. While we closed on the sale of this division in September 2019, it remains uncertain whether this strategic shift will be successful.
COVID-19 Impact
As of the date of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our financial performance will depend on future developments, including, among other things, the duration and spread of COVID-19, the timing of vaccination efforts, additional governmental restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in the global financial markets, which may impact our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, on acceptable terms or at all, though such risk has not materialized to date. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are negatively impacted for an extended period, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
While the outbreak of COVID-19 initially disrupted our business in the first and second quarters of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact on our operations in the second half of 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our business in the future and cause delays in critical development and commercialization activities and/or result in potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to treat its impact, makes it difficult to forecast the effects on our business and results of operations for 2021 and thereafter. See “Item 1A: Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Company - Our business, including our supply chain, liquidity, financial condition and financial results may be adversely disrupted and impacted due to COVID-19 pandemic.”
Sale of Power Conversion Systems Division
In September 2019, we closed on the sale of our power conversion systems division to CE+T Energy. The consideration consisted of $200,000 in cash and 50 shares of CE+T Energy’s common stock, which represented a 5% ownership interest in CE+T Energy as of the closing date. We did not record any value of the equity consideration obtained in the sale as there is not currently a market for such shares and we do not have access to current financial information and future financial projections of CE+T Energy. CE+T Energy also assumed certain liabilities of the power conversion systems division in connection with the sale. The net cash proceeds from the sale were $23,587.
In September 2019, we entered into a sublease with CE+T Energy pursuant to which we sublease approximately seventy-five (75%) percent of our Austin, Texas facility to CE+T Energy. Under the sublease, CE+T Energy is obligated to make monthly payments equal to 75% of all sums due under the master lease and 100% of any maintenance and repair costs related to the subleased premises. The sublease replaced a temporary agreement between us and CE+T Energy, effective in July 2019, that contained similar payment obligations by CE+T Energy for utilization of the subleased premises. Consistent with the master lease, the sublease terminates on May 31, 2021.
February 2021 Offering
In February 2021, we issued and sold 1,352,975 shares of our common stock, including 176,475 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares in full, at a price of $17.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the February 2021 Offering were $21.2 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the February 2021 Offering to fund commercialization and development of its B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes.
Early Warrant Exercise Transaction
In August 2020, we closed the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction, pursuant to which certain holders of our outstanding Series A warrants exercised such Series A warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,176,137 shares of common stock, and we issued to such holders new Series C warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 705,688 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $8.90 per share and an expiration date of August 4, 2025. We raised net proceeds of $2.5 million in the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction to fund commercialization and development of our B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes.
Private Placement
In November 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors, including Dr. Lon E. Bell, our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, for a private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for net proceeds of $3.1 million.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Please see Footnote 2 to our financial statements for a more complete description of our critical accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue and related cost of revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and, as applicable, with the guidance issued by the FASB in June 2018 for the recipients of grants.
Currently, we recognize grant revenue and cost of grant revenue only. Government contracts, including grants, are agreements that generally provide us with cost reimbursement for certain types of development activities over a contractually defined period. Grant revenue is recognized in the period during which we incur the related costs, provided that we incur the cost in accordance with the specifications and work plans determined between us and the government entity.
Research and Development. Research and development costs are presented as a line item under operating expenses and are expensed as incurred.
Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets are composed of patents, which are recorded at cost, and other intangible assets, which are recorded at cost plus the estimated present value of all future payments associated with the other intangible assets. We capitalize third-party legal costs and filing fees, if any, associated with obtaining patents on our new inventions or other intangible assets. Once the patent asset has been placed in service, we amortize these costs over the shorter of the asset’s legal life, generally 20 years, or its estimated economic life using the straight-line method. For the other intangible assets, we amortize the asset over the term of the underlying agreements.
Leases. On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842 utilizing a modified retrospective approach with a date of initial application at the beginning of the period of adoption. At adoption, we recognized a right of use asset of $422,819 and lease liability of $427,131. As the discount rate implicit in the lease was not readily determinable and we did not have any outstanding indebtedness, we utilized market data, giving consideration to remaining term of the lease, to estimate our incremental borrowing rate at 8% per annum for purposes of calculating the right of use asset and lease liability.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.
Stock-Based Compensation. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “Stock Compensation,” when recording stock-based compensation. Grants to non-employees are also accounted for under ASC 718. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the commonly used Black-Scholes option valuation model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
Grant Price - The grant price is determined based on the closing share price on the date of grant.
Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on US Treasury securities at the time of grant with an equivalent term of the expected life of the award.
Expected lives - As permitted by SAB 107, due to our insufficient history of option activity, we utilize the simplified approach to estimate the options’ expected term, calculated as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the award.
Expected volatility - Volatility is estimated based on the historical volatilities of comparable companies.
Expected dividend yield - Dividend yield is based on current yield at the grant date or the average dividend yield over the historical period. We have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019
Grant Revenues. Grant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $428,129. The grant revenues relate to a $1.2 million subcontract with Diversified Technologies, Inc. (“DTI”) to supply B-TRAN™ devices as part of a two-year contract awarded to DTI by the United States Naval Sea Systems Command (“NAVSEA”) for the development and demonstration of a B-TRAN™ enabled high efficiency direct current circuit breaker. We expect the grant revenue related to the NAVSEA subcontract to continue throughout 2021 with zero or minimal revenue recognized in 2022. We also expect to pursue additional government funding that may result in additional grant revenues in the future.
Cost of Grant Revenues. Cost of grant revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $428,129. The cost of grant revenues relates to the subcontract discussed above and are equal to the associated grant revenues resulting in no gross profit. We expect no gross profit under the subcontract with DTI or other grants that we are pursuing, or may pursue, in 2021.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased by $670,742, or 64%, to $1,720,893 in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,050,151 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expense of $392,556, contract labor for B-TRAN™ driver design of $115,063, semiconductor fabrication costs of $108,879 and personnel costs of $58,840. Stock-based compensation expense was higher as a majority of stock option grants in 2020 vested immediately. We expect modestly higher research and development expenses in 2021 as we accelerate development and commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $281,977, or 14%, to $2,347,089 in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2,065,112 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to higher stock-based compensation costs of $291,752 as a majority of stock option grants in 2020 vested immediately. Higher personnel costs of $249,101 and chief executive officer search fees of $137,459 were offset by lower legal fees of $214,057 and cost reduction activities of $182,278, including, but not limited to, lower facilities costs, insurance, taxes and travel, with lower travel primarily being a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in 2021.
Other Expenses. Other expenses increased by $3,721,648 to $3,725,915 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4,267 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in other expenses was due to non-cash warrant inducement expense of $3,720,866 in connection with the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction, as discussed below.
Loss from Continuing Operations. Our loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7,793,897 or 150% higher than the $3,119,530 loss from continuing operations for year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the factors discussed above including the non-cash warrant inducement expense of $3,720,866 and higher research and development and general and administrative spending.
Loss from Discontinued Operations. We did not have a loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $799,025. Loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a $405,000 impairment on assets held for sale to write-down these assets to expected net proceeds from the sale. Our discontinued operations were sold in September 2019.
Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations. We did not have a loss on sale of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as our discontinued operations were sold in September 2019. Our loss on sale of discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $9,107.
Net Loss. Our net loss increased by $3,866,235, or 98%, to $7,793,897 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from a net loss of $3,927,662 for the year ended December 31, 2019 for the reasons discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We currently generate grant revenue only and expect grant revenue to likely be our only source of revenue for 2021. We have incurred losses since inception. We have funded our operations to date through the sale of common stock and warrants.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,157,256 and $3,057,682, respectively. Our net working capital and long-term debt at December 31, 2020 were $2,786,900 and $91,407, respectively. As discussed below, in May 2020, we received a PPP Loan (as defined below) to temporarily subsidize our payroll and facilities costs in a business landscape impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in cash outflows of $3,019,032, which were due to the loss from continuing operations for the period of $7,793,897 and slightly unfavorable balance sheet timing of $7,461, partly offset by non-cash items including warrant inducement expense of $3,720,866, stock-based compensation of $868,648, depreciation and amortization of $122,152, stock issued for services of $50,000 and patent impairment charges of $20,660.
Operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in cash outflows of $3,218,657, which were due to the loss from continuing operations for the period of $3,119,530 and cash used in operating activities related to discontinued operations of $688,074, partly offset by favorable balance sheet timing of $279,438, stock-based compensation of $184,339, depreciation and amortization of $110,463 and patent impairment charges of $14,707.
We expect a modest increase in cash outflows from operating activities in 2021 as we accelerate development and commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology.
Investing activities related to continuing operations in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 resulted in cash outflows of $67,160 and $104,098, respectively, primarily for the acquisition of intangible assets. Investing activities related to discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a cash inflow of $23,587 on the net proceeds from the sale of these discontinued operations in September 2019.
Financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in cash inflows of $3,185,766 and included net proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $3,094,359 and proceeds from loans of $91,407. Financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in cash inflows of $3,098,773 related to the net proceeds from the Private Placement, as defined and further described below.
PPP Loan
In May 2020, we entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (collectively the “PPP Loan”) with BBVA USA pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. We received total proceeds of $91,407 from the unsecured PPP Loan. The PPP Loan is scheduled to mature in May 2022 and has an interest rate of 1.00% per annum and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act. The PPP Loan may be prepaid by us at any time prior to its maturity with no prepayment penalties. The first payment due date was originally in December 2020 but BBVA USA extended the first due date to May 2021 as the PPP Flexibility Act of 2020 extended the deferral period for payment of principal and interest for all PPP borrowers.
The PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults and breaches of representations and warranties. Subject to certain conditions, the PPP Loan may be forgiven in whole or in part by applying for forgiveness pursuant to the CARES Act and the PPP. The amount of loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula based on a number of factors, including the amount of loan proceeds used by us during the 8-week or 24-week period after the loan origination for certain purposes, including payroll costs, rent payments on certain leases and certain qualified utility payments, provided that, among other things, at least 60% of the loan amount is used for eligible payroll costs, the employer maintaining or rehiring employees and maintaining salaries at certain level. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act and the PPP, we used the proceeds from the PPP Loan primarily for payroll costs. We applied for forgiveness of the PPP Loan during the first quarter of 2021. It is our expectation that the PPP Loan will be forgiven but no assurance can be given that we will be granted forgiveness of the PPP Loan in whole or in part.
February 2021 Offering
In February 2021, we issued and sold 1,352,975 shares of our common stock, including 176,475 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares in full, at a price of $17.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the February 2021 Offering were $21.2 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the February 2021 Offering to fund commercialization and development of our B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes.
Early Warrant Exercise Transaction
In July 2020, we entered into letter agreements (the “Letter Agreements”) with certain of our Series A warrant holders (the “Series A Warrant Holders”), who were previously issued warrants (the “Original Warrants”) to purchase shares of our common stock in the Private Placement. The Series A Warrant Holders agreed to the early exercise of their Original Warrants pursuant to the Letter Agreements (the “Early Warrant Exercise Transaction”). The transaction closed in August 2020. We raised net proceeds of $2.5 million in the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction. We intend to utilize the net proceeds from the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction to fund commercialization and development of our B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes.
Pursuant to the Letter Agreements, in consideration of the Series A Warrant Holders exercising Original Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,176,137 shares of common stock, we issued to the Series A Warrant Holders new Series C warrants (the “New Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 705,688 shares of common stock, which is equal to 60% of the shares underlying the Original Warrants included in the Transaction. The New Warrants have an exercise price of $8.90 per share and an expiration date of August 4, 2025. The estimated fair value of the New Warrants was $3.7 million on the date of issuance and was recognized as a non-cash warrant inducement expense within other expenses in our statement of operations.
Private Placement
In November 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors, including Dr. Lon E. Bell, our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, for a private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for net proceeds of $3.1 million (the “Private Placement”). The Private Placement closed in November 2019. In the Private Placement, we issued an aggregate of (i) 544,950 shares of common stock at a price of $2.4763 per share and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 868,443 shares of common stock that are immediately exercisable and have no expiration date, at a price of $2.4763 less a nominal exercise price of $0.001 per pre-funded warrant. We also issued to the investors warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,766,751 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.32 per share that are immediately exercisable and will expire five years from the issuance date. As compensation to the placement agent in the Private Placement, in addition to a cash fee for its services, we also issued to the placement agent a warrant to purchase up to 70,670 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $2.9716 per share. The other terms of the placement agent warrant are substantially the same as the investor warrants. We have utilized a majority, and expect to utilize the remainder, of the net proceeds from the Private Placement to fund development of our B-TRAN™ technology and working capital and general corporate purposes.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
