Results of Operations
General
The inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present, in all material respects, our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole. Actual results may vary from the estimates and assumptions we make.
Results of Operation
Revenues. Due to the exploration rather than the production nature of our business, we did not have any revenue associated with our business activities; furthermore, we do not expect to have significant operating revenue in the foreseeable future.
Operating expenses. Our operating expenses include exploration expenses, general and administrative expenses, professional fees and transfer agent and filing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our operating expenses decreased by $364,744 or 88%, to $49,990 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $414,734 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
This change was mainly associated with expenditures on general and administrative fees, which decreased by $240,123 to $11,479 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $251,602 we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. The main component affecting the change in general and administrative expenses was associated with absence of management consulting fees, as the Company’s related parties agreed to provide their consulting services free of charge. During the comparative year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $240,000 in management consulting fees. Our exploration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $131,024, or 95%, from $138,373 we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, to $7,349 in exploration expenses we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020. The exploration expenses were associated with annual payments for the Lazy Claims and the Loman Claims. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid $124,000 in consulting fees associated in part with preparing geological program to be run on Lazy Claims and $11,832 for other exploration expenses. The Company did not have similar expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020. These decreases were in part offset by increased professional fees of $20,900, a $4,300 increase from $16,600 we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, and by $10,262 in transfer agent and filing fees, which increased by $2,103, as compared to $8,159 we incurred during the comparative period. Legal and transfer agent and filing fees increased as a result of our decision to consolidate our Common Stock on 1-for-10 basis, which became effective on October 28, 2020.
Other items. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $135,849 gain (2019 - $345,435) on fair value of equity investments, which resulted from the revaluation of WRR Shares and WRR Warrants. The gain resulted from the increase of the market price of WRR common stock from CAD$0.085 per share at December 31, 2019, to CAD$0.10 per share at December 31, 2020. In comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the market price of WRR common stock increased from CAD$0.06 per share at December 31, 2018, to CAD$0.085 per share at December 31, 2019, resulting in an overall gain. During the same period, we recorded $168,866 gain on the sale of 5,640,000 WRR shares for net proceeds of $540,579 (2019 - we sold 5,242,000 WRR Shares for net proceeds of $470,601, resulting in $232,676 gain). We invested $490,819 of the proceeds from the sales of WRR shares into high interest saving account with a major Canadian bank, which generated $2,881 in interest revenue (2019 - $5,118). Since our investment in WRR shares and warrants and the funds held in the high interest savings account are held in Canadian dollars, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded gain of $30,552 (2019 - $5,310) associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Net income. At December 31, 2020, our net income was $288,158, as compared to net income of $173,805 we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in the net income resulted mainly from the sale of our equity investments in WRR, as well as unrealized gain on revaluation of the equity investments we continued to carry at December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had a cash balance of $893,823, of which $490,819 (CAD$624,910) was held in the high interest savings account, and a working capital deficit of $536,890 with cash flows used in operations totaling $44,509 for the year then ended. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our operations were funded with $540,579 cash we generated from the sales of our equity investments.
We did not generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities to satisfy our cash requirements for the year ended December 31, 2020. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from our operations to repay the amounts owing under these notes and advances payable, or to service our other debt obligations.
To provide us with the necessary capital to accomplish our plan of operation we intend to seek additional financing in the form of equity or debt. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital. If we are unable to secure additional capital through equity or debt financing, we may choose to sell all or part of our investment in WRR.
Cash Flow
Net cash used in operating activities
Our net cash used in operating activities decreased by $51,297, or 54%, to $44,509 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $95,806 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $47,109 to cover our cash operating costs; this use of cash was offset by increase in our accounts payable of $2,600.
Our net cash used in operating activities increased by $64,362, or 205%, to $95,806 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with $31,444 for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $404,306 to cover our cash operating costs; this use of cash was offset by increase in our accounts payable of $68,500, and by $240,000 increase in related party payables, which were associated with consulting fees we accrued to the companies controlled by Mr. Cocks and Mr. Levine.
Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $135,849 gain on revaluation of fair value of equity investments associated with WRR Shares and WRR Warrants which resulted from the fluctuation in share prices and foreign exchange rates, we also recorded $168,866 gain on sale of our equity investments. Since our equity investments are held in CAD$, we recorded $30,552 gain resulting from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates during the year.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $345,435 gain on revaluation of fair value of equity investments associated with WRR Shares and WRR Warrants which resulted from the fluctuation in share prices and foreign exchange rates, we also recorded $232,676 gain on sale of our equity investments.
Net cash provided by investing activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $540,579 on the sale of 5,640,000 WRR Shares.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $470,601 on the sale of 5,242,000 WRR Shares which was in part offset by $10,395 we used to acquire Loman Property claims.
Net cash provided by financing activities
We did not engage in any financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $1,100 from WRR and $100 from Mr. Cocks under non-interest-bearing advances to pay certain vendor payables.
Going Concern
At December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficit of $536,890 and cash on hand of $893,823, which is not sufficient to carry out our current plan of operation. Our capital assets include equity investment in WRR shares and warrants, which we can use as a source of additional cash inflow, should we decide to sell all or part of our investment. In addition, we are actively pursuing other means of financing our operations through additional equity and/or debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to procure funds sufficient to support our day-to-day operations and exploration programs. If operating difficulties or other factors (many of which are beyond our control) delay our realization of revenues or cash flows from operations, we may be limited in our ability to pursue our business plan. Moreover, if our resources from obtaining additional capital or cash flows from operations, once we commence them, do not satisfy our operational needs or if unexpected expenses arise due to unanticipated pressures or if we decide to expand our business plan beyond its currently anticipated level or otherwise, we will require additional financing to fund our operations, in addition to anticipated cash generated from our operations. Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. In a worst-case scenario, we might not be able to fund our operations or to remain in business, which could result in a total loss of our stockholders’ investment. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, and these newly issued securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past fiscal year.
Capital Expenditures
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $10,395 to acquire Loman Property claims. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did have any transactions resulting in capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Pronouncements
We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect, and that may impact our financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
