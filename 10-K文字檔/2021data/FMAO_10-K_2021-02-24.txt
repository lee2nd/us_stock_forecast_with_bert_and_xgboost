ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Company follows general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates. At times the application of these principles requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different assumptions, estimates and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on assumptions, estimates and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Examples of critical assumptions, estimates and judgments are when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not required to be recorded at fair value warrants
an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event.
All significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued and how those values are determined for the financial statements. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to assumptions, estimates and judgments underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and the valuation of its Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) and Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) as the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available.
OREO, which is comprised of assets acquired by the Bank, through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
The ALLL represents management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio at the report date. The estimate is a composite of a variety of factors including experience, collateral value, and the general economy. ALLL includes a specific portion, a formula driven portion, and a general nonspecific portion. The collection and ultimate recovery of the book value of the collateral, in most cases, is beyond our control.
The Company is also required to estimate the value of its MSR. The Company recognizes as separate assets rights to service fixed rate single-family mortgage loans that it has sold without recourse but services for others for a fee. Mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value, based upon pricing multiples as determined by the purchaser, when the loans are sold. Mortgage servicing assets are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value, adjusted for amortization, or estimated fair value. Amortization is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income using the level yield method. For purposes of determining impairment, the mortgage servicing assets are stratified into like groups based on loan type, term, new versus seasoned and interest rate. The valuation is completed by an independent third party.
The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the potential for the impairment of the value of mortgage servicing assets. Increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced.
The Company’s mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the Company. This asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The mortgage servicing rights are then amortized as noninterest expense in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights. There are a number of factors, however, that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company, including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the servicing right. For example, if the mortgage loan is prepaid, the Company will receive fewer servicing fees, meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the Company’s balance sheet. Therefore, in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the Company of the mortgage servicing rights, the Company receives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party. The independent third party’s valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the Company’s loan servicing portfolio, such as loan terms, interest rates and recent national prepayment experience, as well as current national market interest rate levels, market forecasts and other economic conditions. Management, with the advice from its third party valuation firm, review the assumptions related to prepayment speeds, discount rates, and capitalized mortgage servicing income on a quarterly basis. Changes are reflected in the following quarter’s analysis related to the mortgage servicing asset. In addition, based upon the independent third party’s valuation of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights, management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata, if necessary, to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company. The estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain, and different estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s net income and results of operations. The valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions. The accuracy of these estimates and assumptions by management and its third party can be directly tied back to the fact that management has not been required to record a valuation allowance through its income statement based upon the valuation of each stratum of serving rights.
For more information regarding the estimates and calculations used to establish the ALLL and the value of Mortgage Servicing Rights, please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided herewith.
2020 in Review
2020 started out to be the year of execution. After a good beginning in terms of loan growth and initiatives the first two months, March brought the year of unprecedented change. The Federal Reserve decreased its overnight rate by fifty basis points on March 3rd. As we were adjusting to that change, they again decreased the rate on March 15th by a before unseen 100 basis points. We began to see the disruption caused by COVID-19 and the focus of the Bank quickly changed. Execution took on a new meaning related to following the actions governed by the Bank’s pandemic flu plan. The Bank took immediate measures and adjusted operations to protect the health and safety of their employees, customers and communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to provide financial services. Please see section titled COVID-19 for additional information related to actions taken.
The Company again reports record earnings in total and in earnings per share. This was achieved in the midst of a global pandemic. Net income of $20.1 million, which included $7.0 million of loan loss provision, increased by $1.7 million as compared to 2019. Earnings per share of $1.80 was $0.14 higher than 2019’s $1.66. The improvement is credited to an increase in net interest income and noninterest income offset by increases in loan loss provision and noninterest expense, primarily attributable to salaries, wages and employee benefits.
The Company’s asset size grew $302.2 million with net loans accounting for $77.5 million and included $36.2 million of PPP loans, and the remaining difference primarily coming from an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $124.4 million and securities of $85.5 million.
The Company continued to work towards its three year strategic plan that was established in 2019. The vision statement, “Community Vested to Help People Realize Their Best Lives,” was accentuated with the approval of $87.8 million in PPP loans helping approximately 947 small businesses protect over 12,400 jobs. The following five strategic initiatives that will help take the Company to the next level are: customer acquisition and retention, talent optimization, actively pursue acquisition opportunities, improve operating efficiency and financial performance, and develop a comprehensive digital strategy for internal and external constituencies.
Our strategic initiative of attracting and cultivating talent was explored with the retirements of our Chief Lending Officer and Marketing Manager in the first quarter. Todd Graham’s duties were assumed by Rex Rice who had been our Senior Commercial Banking Manager. The shift in the commercial team was completed with David Gerken promoted to Sr. VP/Commercial Banking Manager and we added Brett Baumeister as our Sr. VP/Commercial Banking Manager in Eastern Ohio. Mr. Gerken was an existing team member and Mr. Baumeister was a new addition within the last year. Marty Filogamo was replaced by Amy Cover, who had been the Assistant Marketing Manager.
Due to the retirement of Jim Burkhart in the second quarter, the Bank hired Shalini Singhal as our new Chief Information Officer. Shalini is a proven CIO who will lead our digital efforts. The management team is experienced, and we are confident of their ability to lead the Bank in the years to come.
After the difficult growing conditions and tight margins encountered during 2019, the 2020 planting season was one of the smoothest we have seen in our market area for several years as crops were planted in a timely manner. Many farmers do continue to utilize crop insurance which protects revenue. COVID-19 has created challenges in the agriculture sector just as it has for the entire economy. These challenges include commodity prices, livestock supply chain, handling employees, and concerns with the overall health of the economy. The growing season in our market area was variable with some areas receiving timely rains and others needing moisture. The 2020 harvest fluctuated throughout our market area, but overall yields were positive. Strong global demand for agriculture products has created a rise in grain prices. This has resulted in profitable pricing opportunities for our customer base for both 2020 and 2021. The grain, livestock and agri-business sector of our portfolio continues to remain healthy and concerns manageable.
2020 was an unprecedented year for both F&M and our commercial clients. The COVID-19 pandemic caused issues for our labor force in the F&M footprint. During the second half of the year, most of the commercial sector in the Bank’s markets returned to work. Business volumes and profitability returned for many commercial clients; however still lagged for those industries most impacted by COVID-19. The low rate environment continued to drive acquisitions and construction activity. Projects are moving forward, and leases are being executed. Commercial performance continues to remain strong.
Loan Production Offices (LPO) in Muncie, Indiana, Oxford, Ohio and West Bloomfield, Michigan all have new loan activity and are helping extend the F&M footprint. The Bank was able to hire well known talented bankers from each area. The Bank is completing a new full-service office in Fort Wayne, Indiana which will open in first quarter 2021.
In November, the Company purchased the assets and clients of Adams County Financial Resources (ACFR), a registered investment advisory firm located in Geneva, IN, with approximately $83.0 million of assets under management at November 30, 2020. Please refer to Note 2 for additional information.
In December, the Company also announced the acquisition of Ossian Financial Services, Inc. (OFSI), which operates two full-service bank offices in Northeast Indiana and had approximately $122.0 million in assets as of September 30, 2020. Please refer to Note 20 for additional information.
A trend of increasing improvement in net income continued from 2018 through 2020. 2020 increased 9.2% over 2019 and 2019 was 23.1% higher than 2018. Dividends declared also increased over the corresponding years. 2020’s declared dividends at $0.66 a share was 8.2% higher than 2019’s $0.61 per share and 2019 was 8.9% higher than 2018’s $0.56 per share. The Company remains strong, stable and well capitalized and has the capacity to continue to cover the increased costs of doing business. The Company continues to look for new opportunities to generate and protect revenue while providing additional channels through which to serve our customers and maintain our high level of customer satisfaction. The Company plans to continue our strategy of expansion into new markets, whether by acquisition or the establishment of new branch office locations.
COVID-19: What the Company knows, what steps have been taken, what has changed going forward
Shareholders
Dividend declaration
The Company expects to continue to maintain the payment of its quarterly dividend consistent with its past practices. We are sensitive to the needs of our long-time shareholders that utilize these funds to supplement their living expenses, especially in this low interest rate environment. Dividends declared during the quarter at $0.17 per share increased by 6.25% over last year’s fourth quarter at $0.16 per share. Total dividends of $0.66 declared for the year 2020 increased 8.20% over 2019’s total of $0.61.
Annual Meeting
The Company held its Annual Meeting on April 16th; however, in light of the governmental restrictions the meeting was significantly different than in the past. There was no dinner, no presentation of 2019 or an outlook for 2020 and only a small group of directors and officers present. For the three items to be considered at the meeting, shareholders were asked to seriously consider not attending and vote by proxy. Over 80% of the shareholders voted by proxy. The Company plans to hold its annual meeting in 2021 virtually and will include a short presentation of the financials and comments from our Chairman and President.
Communities
Offices
With the health of our employees and customers being our top concern, as of March 20th, the Bank temporarily suspended branch lobby hours to the public for walk-in transactions. Appointments could be made at branches to complete all needed paperwork and transactions. Drive-thru services remained open as well as all ATM’s and ITM’s to complete needed transactions. To assure branches remained open, employees were divided into teams who rotated every three days to two weeks as a means to practice social distancing while limiting any possible exposure. During the month of May, the retail re-open team developed an employee handbook which focused on opening protocols, employee training, health and wellness and facility signage. Branch re-openings began on June 3rd with the last branches re-opening on June 15th. We have continued to monitor and adjust lobby access as needed. Following the holidays, we implemented a hub strategy keeping at least one office full service in each of six regions and limited lobby access at the remainder. We had a few rare occurrences when lack of staffing required us to initiate limited access for a day. All offices, as long as adequate staffing is available, returned to full access in February. This is an area where the Bank remains diligent in protecting staff and customers from contributing to the exposure and/or spread of the virus. Internal controls have not been significantly modified due to COVID-19.
Small Business
2020 was an unprecedented year for both F&M and our business clients. The COVID-19 pandemic caused issues for the labor force in the F&M footprint. As a Small Business Administration (SBA) approved provider, the Bank was able to immediately participate in the SBA PPP established under the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The PPP provided much needed assistance to businesses in our communities. The Bank was able to process applications for around 947 small businesses protecting over 12,400 jobs which provided approximately $87.8 million in needed funding. Loan size varied
from $300 to $2.3 million with only 2 loans over $2 million. Net fee income from PPP loans to be recognized over 24 months will be $3.2 million.
During the second half most of the commercial sector in the Bank’s markets returned to work in an increased capacity. Business volumes and profitability returned for many commercial clients, but still lag for those industries most impacted by COVID-19. The Bank began to take applications for PPP loan forgiveness in the third quarter. Forgiveness and principal payments received in the fourth quarter totaled $51.6 million in principal and represented accelerated fee income of $1.2 million for 2020. Forgiveness payments continue into the first quarter of 2021 on the remaining principal balance of $36.2 million. The Bank has also begun the initiating of the newest round of PPP for existing customers, representing round 2 for most; however, it may include some customers who are applying for the first time. F&M remains prepared to assist our customers to take advantage of these programs with the assistance of a third party for reporting purposes.
Consumers
Home Loan
With the Federal Reserve rate drops of 150 basis points in March (100 basis points of which was directly related to the effects of the virus on the economy), a surge in home loan activity has occurred. Much of the activity is refinance related and the Bank has experienced the highest amount of applications in its history, both in number of and dollar amount. Given the nature of the programs, the results were recorded beginning in the second quarter and continues into 2021. The Bank sells most of its home loans into the secondary market through Freddie Mac.
Existing loans on our books for which the Bank has received inquiries into forbearance agreements, totaled over 125 as of December 31, 2020. Of these inquiries, customers entered into agreements on 99 loans totaling just over $9.1 million. 30 loans were in-house making up $2.2 million in principal balance and 69 were secondary market loans which we service with balances totaling $6.9 million. Of the 30 in-house loans, 3 are still in forbearance, 2 are in an active repayment plan and 25 have transitioned from their forbearance into a current status by fully reinstating, completing a repayment plan, entering into a payment deferral, curing by refinance or paying off the loan. Of the 69 secondary market loans, 3 are still in forbearance, 5 are in an active repayment plan and 61 have transitioned from their forbearance into a current status by fully reinstating, completing a repayment plan, entering into a payment deferral, or paying off the loan. We remain ready to assist our customers as needs continue.
Retail Loans
The Bank offered its “Skip-a-pay” program to consumers with installment loans, which allows the customer to skip the payment and extend the maturity of the contract for the payment period. We are allowing two payments to be skipped upon request with an additional one possible at the end of the initial request upon review. Normally, the Bank would charge a fee for this program - the fee has been waived. The Bank would also normally require the interest for the period to be collected and that requirement is currently waived. Interest is a part of the extended maturity payments. We have assisted 149 customers currently with loan balances totaling just over $2.0 million. 139 loans have been extended representing approximately $1.9 million and 259 extended months.
Waiving of late payment fees for our customers was introduced on March 16, 2020 and ceased on June 30, 2020. As of June 30th, the Bank had foregone fees of $307 thousand on loans to help our customers. Of the $307 thousand, $131 thousand was related to two past due commercial loans. As a community bank, it is, by definition, what we should do.
Depositors
The Bank’s most popular checking account, which includes requirements to earn a reward, removed the requirement of debit card transactions to be completed during a cycle for the months of April and May. In the Bank’s geographical area, the states issued “stay at home” guidelines and many of our customers were concerned with being able to complete the requirement. This impacted almost 11.6 thousand accounts and represented just under $101 million in average account balances. The product includes the option of attaching a savings account for which the same requirements were waived and impacted an additional almost 7 thousand accounts and $113.1 million in average account balances, calculated as of June 30th. Overall, typically 80-85% of our customers meet all the requirements. The waiving of the debit card transactions allowed those customers to receive the reward and possibly an additional 77.5% of the previous non-qualifiers which represented the other 15-20% in total. With the removal of the “stay at home” guidelines, the debit card transaction requirement was reinstated beginning with the June cycle on May 29th. During the months of April and May, most individuals still met their debit card transaction requirement with the “stay at home” order in place. Our customers are meeting the same percentage of qualifications as pre-COVID levels.
Employees
The Bank continued paying employees their full pay through March 31, 2020. During this time period, accumulated PTO and vacation time were frozen and not required to be used to receive full pay. The Bank continues to promote social distancing by encouraging employees who can work remotely to do so and in other cases, departments have been dispersed to keep the team separated. As of April 1st, the Bank is following The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) which requires employers to provide their employees with paid sick leave and extended family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. These provisions were in effect until December 31, 2020. Qualifying reasons for leave related to COVID-19 include the employee: (1) being subject to a quarantine order, (2) being advised by a healthcare provider to self-quarantine, (3) experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and is seeking a medical diagnosis, (4) caring for an individual subject to a quarantine order, (5) caring for his or her child whose school or place of care is closed or (6) experiencing any other substantially-similar condition specified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. All time off related to the above reasons was being separately documented within our time and attendance system. The Bank was able to reduce its employer tax for up to two weeks (80 hours, or a part-time employee’s two-week equivalent).
At the end of December 2020, the Federal government extended the Family First Cares Act (FFCRA) into 2021. However, this extension is not mandatory, but at the discretion of the employer. To ensure our employees can make the best decisions about their health and keep our work environments safe, the Bank extended this leave through the end of March 2021.The Bank’s Pandemic team continues to meet bi-weekly and safety protocols continue to be followed, including masking and social distancing.
Financial - Exposures
Given the timing of the outbreak in the United States of the COVID-19 pandemic, management believes that the main detrimental impact on the Company’s performance was a factor in the economic qualitative adjustment for the calculation of the allowance for loan loss. Subsequently, the loan loss provision was increased which also included an increase due to loan growth. The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge to the global economy in general and the financial services sector in particular. However, there is still significant uncertainty regarding the overall length of the pandemic and the aggregate impact that it will have on global and regional economies, including uncertainties regarding the potential positive effects of governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic. With so much uncertainty, it is impossible for the Bank to accurately predict the impact that the pandemic will have on the Company’s primary markets and the overall extent to which it will affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. As the Bank reviews our business customers’ tax returns and initiates the PPP programs of 2021, we will begin to have a better handle on the impact to our customers during 2020 and into 2021. At a minimum, the actions taken by the Company to assist its customers experiencing challenges from the pandemic, such as through the Bank’s “Skip-a-pay” program, the waiver of late payment fees, and the entry into loan forbearance agreements, did have an impact on the Company’s 2020 performance. Nonetheless, management believes that the Company’s current regulatory capital position is adequate to face the coming challenges.
The Company has a limited exposure to many sectors of the economy that will likely be impacted for an extended period such as the travel, restaurant, hospitality, energy and retail industries. The Bank does not have any direct exposure to the energy industry. Hotels, entertainment and food related businesses are less than 10% of our overall loan portfolio as shown in the chart which follows. In addition, the Bank’s hotel customers are financially strong business owners, operating brand name hotels in compelling locations. The Bank, along with many other financial institutions, has increased its provision for loan losses in the current year compared to 2019 by approximately $5.9 million. The Bank is fully prepared to make additional provisions as warranted by the COVID-19 situation in 2021.
The Bank had 190 loans that received either deferment payments or interest only payments due to COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, there were only five modifications left representing a total of $3.6 million. Of those remaining there were no outstanding full payment deferment loans. Three loans are interest only in the entertainment sector with $1.2 million in total balances with all scheduled for original repayment terms to begin by early April 2021. One office building with a $2.3 million balance with interest only payments will return to payments in May 2021. One restaurant with a $13 thousand balance received an interest only modification in December with payments to resume in March of 2021.
*Includes Owner Occupied
Report on Adjusted Loans as of December 31, 2020
Our credit administration is closely monitoring and analyzing these higher risk segments within the loan portfolio, tracking loan payment deferrals, customer liquidity and providing timely reports to senior management and the board of directors. The Bank is in frequent contact with our borrowers during this time of uncertainty and has had only one COVID-19 related downgrade which was less than $10 million during 2020. The Bank has stress tested our top five commercial concentrations which include retail commercial real estate, hotels, multi-family, industrial commercial real estate and assisted living. An outside third party has reviewed 55% of our commercial portfolio along with our internal credit department having reviewed 75% of our loan portfolio as a result of new money, renewals or annual reviews. Based on the Company’s capital levels, prudent underwriting policies, loan concentration diversification and our geographic footprint, we expect to be able to manage the economic risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic and remain adequately capitalized.
Recent Legislative Action
On December 21, 2020, the House and Senate passed legislation to supply the latest round of COVID-19 relief, authorizing more than $900 billion in economic aid to small businesses and consumers-the second largest stimulus in history, behind only the CARES Act that Congress enacted in March. The bill also includes appropriations provisions to keep the government funded through September 30, 2021, as well as a host of miscellaneous items. Key banking provisions under this legislation include the following:
•
An additional $284.6 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funding for loans to small businesses, including for borrowers who have previously received a PPP loan.
•
A one-page simplified forgiveness process for PPP loans under $150,000.
•
Clarification to various CARES Act provisions, the tax treatment of PPP expenses, lender responsibilities for agent fees, and lender “hold harmless” protections under the PPP and other laws.
•
A further delay in Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) accounting until 60 days after the termination of the national emergency, or January 1, 2022.
•
A further optional delay in Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting until January 1, 2022
•
A new round of Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) for consumers, with aggressive distribution timelines and new exemptions from garnishments.
•
Significant added support for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs).
•
Funding for agricultural support programs and for renter assistance programs.
•
Termination of existing Federal Reserve emergency lending authority under the CARES Act, while preserving the Fed’s general 13(3) emergency authority existing prior to that Act.
Material Changes in Results of Operations
Net Interest Income
The discussion now centers on the individual line items of the consolidated statement of income and their effect on net income. This section will focus on the most traditional source of revenue contributing to the profitability of the Company which is net interest income.
Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities used to fund those assets, such as interest bearing deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amount and composition of earning assets and liabilities. The change in net interest income is most often measured by two statistics - interest spread and net interest margin. The difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities represents the interest spread. The net interest margin is the difference of funds (interest expense) between the yield on earning assets and the cost as a percentage of earning assets. Because noninterest bearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and stockholders’ equity also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the net interest spread.
As mentioned previously, the largest factor of the record earnings for 2020 was the $6.2 million improvement in net interest income as compared to 2019. In 2019, net interest income increased $13.7 million as compared to 2018. Interest and fee income from loans were responsible for the improvement. Interest income from loans, including fees, increased $3.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. This was preceded by an increase in 2019 of $19.9 million as compared to 2018. The underlying factors for the reason of the increase differed between the two time periods. 2019 was aided by prime rate increases which drove the effective interest rates on the Bank’s variable loans over their floor rates. During the second half of 2019, the prime rate decreased 75 basis points in a 91-day time period which was followed by a decrease of 50 basis points on March 3rd and a decrease of 100 basis points on March 15th. In 2020, PPP loans generated $2.8 million in loan interest and fee income. 2019 loan interest income included $1.985 million for the reversal of a credit loss established for two commercial purchased credit-impaired loans that were paid off during the second quarter. In both 2020 and 2019, the volume of loan growth was the largest contributing factor to the improved profitability. Securities were sold or matured with the proceeds used to fund the loan growth. The security portfolio increased $47.1 million in average during 2020 as compared to 2019, and $1.6 million in average over 2018 average balances. Interest income from that balance sheet component increased $119 thousand over 2019 while 2019 increased $678 thousand over 2018. Overall, total interest income was $1.9 million higher for 2020 than 2019 and was $21.9 million higher for 2019 than 2018.
Interest expense decreased from all interest bearing funding sources with the exception of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase in 2020 over the time period of 2019. During 2019, interest expense increased in all interest bearing funding sources as compared to 2018. Overall, the funding goal the last three years has been to grow core deposits. Two strategies have been employed through the years, one of allowing expensive time deposits to run off until needed for funding and secondly to offer new non-interest bearing deposit products. Both of these strategies were to assist in controlling interest expense in a rising rate environment. Competition forced us to increase rates for deposits in 2019 while rates were lowered in 2020 in response to the prime rate drop of 150 basis points. Even with the interest rate decreases, average interest bearing deposits increased $158.6 million compared to 2019. During 2020, interest expense from deposits decreased by $4.3 million from 2019 and 2019 increased $7.0 million over 2018. The majority, approximately 137.5%, of the increased expense of 2020 was influenced by decreased rates rather than due to additional cost associated with deposit growth.
Total interest expense (which includes deposit, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, and borrowed funds) totaled $10.4, $14.8 and $6.6 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The decreased expense is approximately 134.2% attributable to the falling interest rate environment in 2020 as compared to 2019 and approximately the increased expense is 68.4% attributable to the rising interest rate environment in the 2019 to 2018 comparison. Borrowed fund balances increased in January of 2019, as a result of the acquisition of Bank of Geneva. 2015’s three year borrowing matured in December of 2018.
The success in improving net interest income confirmed that management’s long term strategy of repositioning the balance sheet and increasing loan balances was the correct approach. Funding loan growth with internal funds, whether from the liquidation of investment securities or core deposits, was a beneficial move.
This concludes the discussion by dollar amount of the improvement. Now the discussion moves on to the percentages and the change in the net interest margin and spread.
Overall, we have seen a decrease in the net interest margin and spread from 2018 to 2020. Interest margin and spread decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 with the lower asset yields only being partly offset by the decreased cost of funds.
Looking at the components behind the change in net interest margin for 2020 as compared to 2019, increased average balances in loans of $184.4 million stands out. The additional revenue of $3.1 million that those balances were responsible for was the largest contributor to the increased interest income of $1.9 million. In 2018 and 2019, loan revenue was positively impacted by the change in the interest rate. The majority of variable loans with floor rates attained the point where rate increases caused the rate to go above the floor. 2018 saw four additional rate hikes of 25 basis points while 2019 had three rate decreases of 25 basis points. As mentioned previously, March of 2020 had two rate decreases of 50 and 100 basis points. The large revenue gain in loan interest was aided by the increased earnings in securities of $678 thousand. The overall asset yield in 2020 decreased by 60 basis points over 2019.
The decreased interest expense in 2020 correlated to the lower rate environment which differed from 2019’s high rate environment in which competition for deposits forced higher interest rates. In the area where the strategic plan was to gather core deposits, the average balance in savings grew by $158.8 million during 2020 as compared to 2019’s average balance. The other average balance increase for core deposits was the change in non-interest bearing demand deposits. 2020’s average balance in this portfolio was $60.7 million higher than 2019’s average balance. Overall, cost of funds decreased 55 basis points for 2020 over 2019. The reason behind the decrease was largely due to rate decreases, not the volume increases.
The net interest margin for 2020 was 3.62% compared to 2019 which was 3.80%. The 0.18% decrease for 2020 was directly related to the decreased interest income which was greater than the decreased interest expense. Net interest spread was 3.38% for 2020 compared to 2019’s 3.43%, creating a 5 basis point difference in the spread. Loans as a percentage of earning assets was 79.3% while loans to total assets was 74.2% for 2020. The goal is, as always, to improve the net interest margin and spread and thereby improve profitability.
In comparing 2019 to 2018, loan volume was primarily responsible for the improvement in interest income as the yield on the overall loan portfolio increased 42 basis points during 2019. The only category of asset yield to decrease was the tax exempt investment securities. Overall, asset yield increased 39 basis points in 2019 as compared to 2018.
The net interest margin fell in 2019, ending 3 basis points below 2018. Asset yield increased 39 basis points while the cost of funds increased 56 basis points. The yields on the individual segments did cause the overall improvement as all increased with the exception of tax exempt securities. The improvement in the asset yield was primarily a result of the change in rate. In addition, loans as a percentage of earning assets increased to 79.9% in 2019 compared to 79.3% in 2018. Loans to total assets also increased to 75.3% for 2019 compared to 2018’s 74.8%. Overall yield improves when the balances of the highest yield asset increases, which is loans.
With respect to the cost of funds, the Bank’s goal is to grow the least expensive category of funding sources. The largest average balance increase for 2019 was $169.1 million in savings deposits over 2018’s average balances. This growth was mostly responsible for the increase in funding expense of 56 basis points when comparing 2019 to 2018.
The Company will always prefer to see improvement in real dollars over percentages. The strategy for increasing core deposits, in order to mitigate the higher cost of funds and to continue to establish the opportunity for fee dollars from services provided, remains for 2021.
Total assets of the Company increased overall as did the earning assets in both average and year-end during 2020 and 2019. This matched the movement in interest dollars. The percentage of average earning assets to total average assets reflects the best utilization of funds. For 2020, the percentage at 93.60% was only slightly lower than 2019 at 94.26%. The addition of new offices increased the non-earning assets with cash balances held at the new offices and also the investment in the capital assets of their building and furniture. One of the things that helped to improve the profitability of 2020 was the percentage of average loans to total assets. For 2020 the average balance of loans to total average assets was 74.21%, for 2019, 75.32%, for 2018, 74.77%. Loans are the highest yielding asset for the Company.
Net interest spread is the difference between what the Company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities. It is generally from this spread that the Company must fund its operations and generate profit. When the asset yield decreases so must funding costs in order to maintain profitability. It becomes increasingly challenging as the asset yield gets closer to the prime lending rate, or the break-even point, of operations. In a rising rate environment, the challenge is to hold the cost steady while allowing time for the asset portfolio to rise. Floors and ceilings on variable products also impact the level of increase in either scenario. The floors provide yield protection in the current lower rate environment while the rising rates will not benefit the asset yield until the spread plus prime is higher than the floor. The challenge is to increase the spread during renewals and on new loans. After the rate hikes in 2017 and 2018, the majority of the loans were now either equal to or over the floors which contributed to the increased asset yield in 2018 and 2019. With the rate decreases in 2019 and 2020, many loans reverted back to the floors.
In terms of interest expense, 2020’s decrease as compared to 2019 was approximately 134.2% due to the decrease in rates. 2019’s increase was due to an increase in rates as compared to 2018.
The impact of the change in the portfolio mix was a factor in the liabilities as it was in the assets. In comparing to 2019, 2020 had movements as average balances increased in savings deposits, federal funds purchased, and securities sold to repurchase. Other borrowed money decreased as advances were paid down or matured. The advances were part of the acquisition of Bank of Geneva with the final advance maturing in 2028. Time deposits decreased $219 thousand as compared to 2019. In comparing to 2018, 2019 had increased average balances in all categories. Time deposits and saving deposits increased in interest expense for 2019 as compared to 2018. Fed Funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase only increased $41 thousand for 2019 and was mostly due to dollar value of advances.
The following tables present net interest income, interest spread and net interest margin for the three years 2018 through 2020, comparing average outstanding balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with the associated interest income and expense. The tables show the corresponding average rates of interest earned and paid. Average outstanding loan balances include non-performing loans and mortgage loans held for sale. Average outstanding security balances are computed based on carrying values including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. The average cost of funds for 2020 was 0.87%, 55 basis points lower than 2019’s 1.42% for interest bearing liabilities.
The yield on tax-exempt investment securities shown in the following charts were computed on a tax equivalent basis. The yield on loans has been tax adjusted for the portion of tax-exempt IDB loans included in the total. Total interest earning assets is therefore also reflecting a tax equivalent yield in both line items, also with the net interest spread and margin. The adjustments were based on a 21% tax rate for all years.
The following tables show changes in interest income, interest expense and net interest resulting from changes in volume and rate variances for major categories of earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Non-Interest Income
The discussion now focuses on the non-interest income and expense generated from the Company for the years ended 2018 through 2020. Non-interest income increased in total for 2020 as compared to 2019, ending at $16.8 million. 2019 had non-interest income of $11.8 million which exceeded 2018’s $10.9 million.
The one line item of non-interest income on the consolidated income statement for 2020 which improved over both 2019 and 2018 was customer service fee revenue. 2020 customer service fee revenue was $2.2 million higher than 2019 while 2019 was $791.0 thousand higher than 2018, mainly due to increased mortgage servicing rights income, debit card income and mortgage release fees. 2020 included a one-time $430 thousand gain on the settlement of a bank owned life insurance contract. Other service charges and fees decreased $841.3 thousand from 2019 which increased $261.9 thousand over 2018’s $4.2 million. The majority of the decrease for 2020 and the increase for 2019 was attributed to overdraft, returned check charges and
recurring overdraft fees from combined business accounts and consumer accounts. Upgrades to our digital products and services continue to occur in both retail and business lines.
The Bank has long promoted the use of debit cards by its customers and continues to build on that philosophy with the introduction of new products. During 2020 the Bank collected interchange revenue, combined with fees collected on foreign ATM usage (noncustomers utilizing our ATMs), of $3.9 million which was $518.2 thousand higher than 2019 and $465.5 thousand higher than 2018. In December of 2019, the Bank became a principal with MasterCard and received a $1.75 million signing bonus. The signing bonus is based on achieving $1.1 billion in signature transactions within the next five years. The bonus is being recognized over 60 months with $350.8 thousand included in 2020’s $3.9 million. While this revenue stream continues to improve with more depositors using electronic methods for purchasing, the expense attributable to card fraud has offset a portion of the revenue gain. Further discussion can be found in the non-interest section regarding the net effect of debit card activity.
Noninterest income from net gain on sales of loans was the highest in 2020 of the three year periods shown. The change was related to the decrease in rates after a couple of years of a rising interest rate environment. The net gain on sale of loans is derived from sales of real estate loans into the secondary market. Of these loan types, the Bank sells 100% of the residential loans and 90% of the agricultural loans. 65.2% of the gains were attributed to the residential loans in 2020, 56.0% in 2019 and 66.5% in 2018. In conjunction with these sales, the Bank maintains servicing rights and those income amounts during all three years are included in the customer service fee income line item and accounted for $1.7 million in 2020, $731.4 thousand in 2019 and $449.1 thousand in revenue for 2018.
The last item in the non-interest income section is the net gain of sale of investments. The Bank has sold securities over the last three years for two main purposes: to provide funds for loan growth and to take advantage of the position of the yield curve when a gain can be recognized on sales without extending the duration of the portfolio longer than wanted. In February of 2020, the Bank did complete security swap transactions that resulted in a gain of $270 thousand. 2019 and 2018 had limited sales for gain recognition due to the flatness of the yield curve which began to occur in second half of 2017. The Bank will not increase short-term gains at the sacrifice of long-term profitability. The available for sale security portfolio switched from an unrealized loss position in 2018 into an unrealized gain position in 2019. The Bank recognized net losses of $26.3 thousand in 2019 and net gains of $9.8 thousand in 2018. The Company also recognized a gain on sale of securities from the holding company of $0.4 thousand in 2019 while proceeds from 2018 were used to provide cash for the acquisition with the losses totaling $19.2 thousand. The net effect of the consolidated number is what shows on the line item of net loss of $26 thousand for 2019 and $9 thousand for 2018.
Non-Interest Expense
Noninterest expense increased 7.0% in 2020 as compared to 2019 and was preceded by a 29.0% increase in 2019 as compared to 2018. Represented in dollars, 2020 was $2.9 million higher than 2019 and 2019 was $9.3 million higher than 2018. The largest factor behind the increase in both years was the expense of employee salaries and wages. During 2020, an additional $2.2 million was spent over 2019 which correlates to an 13.2% increase. When making the same analysis for 2019 as compared to 2018, 2019’s costs increased $2.6 million or 18.7%. Three main components flow into salaries and wages: base salary, deferred costs, and incentives composed of the expense of restricted stock awards and performance incentives. Base pay increased in 2020 with the creation of pay grades and a minimum living wage of $26,000 or $12.50 per hour. 2019 increased with the addition of the six offices acquired from Bank of Geneva. Normal yearly increases to the employees would be included in all years. Base pay was up $2.9 million for 2020 over the previous year and 2019 was up $3.2 million over 2018. The full time equivalent number of employees at each year-end increased to 367 for 2020, to 357 for 2019 compared to 2018’s 288. The Company had also chosen to invest a portion of the tax savings dollars of 2018 to increase the base pay of our lowest paid employees.
Incentive pay as it related to performance was up $194.0 thousand in 2020 over 2019 and down $386.3 thousand in 2019 over 2018. The Return on Assets multiple used to award incentive pay dropped in 2020 and 2019 to 1.0 compared to 2018’s 1.367. The effect of acquisition costs and fair value accretions/amortizations were removed in 2019 and 2018 for the calculation. The measurements used for award incentive pay had improved in 2018 and employees benefited accordingly. The target measurements used for 2018 were increased to negate the paying of incentive for the benefit of the lower tax rate. The expense for the restricted stock awards decreased in 2020 as less shares have been granted to a slightly smaller number of employees and the market value of the shares has decreased. The market value of the Company’s stock increased significantly with the listing on NASDAQ and being included in the Russell 3000 Index during the second quarter of 2017. 718 less shares were awarded in 2020 with a lower value as compared to 2019; therefore, the expense for 2020 was lower by $63.9 thousand which included accelerated expense due to retirement and other of $163.4 thousand as compared to 2019. 5,100 additional restricted shares were awarded in 2019 as compared to 2018 with the value of these awards much lower. 2019’s cost for this program was $342.8 thousand higher than 2018 which included expense due to retirement of $244.7 thousand. The awards incorporate
a three year vesting period so the increase of any one year carries forward through the next two years. This expense should continue to increase as the Company continues its expansion strategy. For further discussion in incentive pay and restricted stock awards, see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.
Along with the salary and wage increase was a slight increase in employee benefits in 2020 as compared to 2019. Employee group insurance accounted for the largest portion of the cost, which was an increase of $441.6 thousand over 2019. This was due to an increase in the cost to provide to a larger number of employees along with a higher level of medical claims. The cost of the 401-K retirement plan decreased $185.1 thousand for 2020 as compared to 2019. The contribution portion relating to the discretionary profit-sharing percentage was 4.6% in 2020 compared to 5.25% for 2019. Workers compensation decreased $173.1 thousand compared to 2019 with the bureau issuing three dividend checks totaling $185.9 thousand. Overall, employee benefits increased $43.0 thousand or 0.8% from 2019.
Along with the salary and wage increase was an increase in employee benefits in 2019 as compared to 2018. Employee group insurance accounted for the largest portion of the cost, which was an increase of $775.6 thousand over 2018. This was due to an increase in the cost to provide to a larger number of employees along with a higher level of medical claims. The cost of the 401-K retirement plan also increased $198.3 thousand for 2019 as compared to 2018. Overall, employee benefits increased $1.4 million or 35.1% from 2018.
Net occupancy expense typically increases as the Company expands, which is what has occurred for 2018 through 2019; however, a decrease occurred for 2020. One factor that can offset occupancy expense is the receipt by the Company of building rent as it is netted out of occupancy expense. The greatest contributor to building rent comes from the division of FM Investments within the Bank. This division experienced a stronger 2020 than 2019; however weaker than 2018. The department was short staffed most of 2020 through 2018. For 2020, building rent as generated from FM Investments was higher by $24.8 thousand. Rent is received in lieu of commissions. This increase of revenue in addition to decreased automobile expenses of $64.2 thousand and building repair and maintenance expenses of $69.7 thousand contributed to the decreased net occupancy expense of $46.0 thousand for 2020 as compared to 2019. Building rent as generated by FM Investments was lower by $60.6 thousand in 2019 contributing to the overall increase to net occupancy to $560.0 thousand in 2019 as compared to 2018.
The 1-4 family mortgage refinancing activity saw a tremendous increase in 2020 with the decline in interest rates. 2020 accounted for the largest number of loans being closed in the Bank’s history. A correlating expense to that activity as it relates to loans sold to the secondary market, is the amortization of mortgage servicing rights. The amortization is the expense that offsets the income recognized when the loan is first made. Income is recorded when the mortgage loan is first sold with servicing retained and is therefore recognized within one year. The amortization, however, is calculated over the life of the loan and accelerated as loans are paid off early. An increase in this expense can be driven by two activities: an increase in the number of sold loans and/or by the acceleration of the expense from payoff and refinance activity. The best picture of the bottom line impact is achieved by netting the income with the expense each year. The net income for 2020 was $691 thousand; 2019 had net income of $244 thousand and was preceded by net income of $86 thousand for 2018. Of course, the value (or income) of the mortgage servicing right when the loans are sold also impacts the net position. As of December 31, 2020, 4,034 loans are being serviced with corresponding balances of $377.5 million. 2019 had 3,691 loans serviced with corresponding balances of $303.9 million. As of December 2018, 3,588 loans were being serviced with balances of $289.2 million.
The impact of mortgage servicing rights to both noninterest income and expense is shown in the following table:
Furniture and equipment steadily increase as we continue to add facilities and invest in technology. Annual maintenance costs continue to grow and become a greater piece of the overall cost. As new services are provided to our customers, the backroom cost to supply them continues to rise. The Company accepts it is an expected cost of doing business and keeping our services relevant to the industry.
Data processing costs were lower in 2020 as compared to 2019 by $785.0 thousand of which $867.6 thousand was acquisition related for termination fees incurred in 2019. Overall, data processing expense for 2019 was expected to be higher with the addition of the six acquired Indiana offices. Data processing expense increased $1.2 million during 2019 as compared to 2018.
As the pricing on many services is based on number of accounts and the Bank fully expects those to increase with the growth from the newer offices and overall Bank growth, this line item is expected to also increase.
The FDIC assessment increased over 2019 while 2019 decreased as compared to 2018. This line item speaks to the health of the Bank and the financial industry. The assessment for 2020 was up $450.0 thousand compared to 2019 as a result of the total assessment base increasing. In 2020, Small Bank Assessment Credits of $125.9 thousand were applied to first quarter’s invoice. Credits in the amount of $204.2 thousand were applied to third and fourth quarter 2019’s invoice. The assessment for 2019 was down $143.0 thousand from 2018.
The last line items with significant variation in noninterest expense to discuss is “consulting fees” and “other general and administrative.” Consulting fees increased by $300.0 thousand in 2020 over 2019 while decreased $259.9 thousand in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2020, $167.0 thousand was paid to the firm who assisted with identifying profit enhancements, $48.0 thousand for Chief Information Officer search, $25.0 thousand to Kasasa for contract termination and $34.0 thousand to develop a predictive customer behavior model. During 2019, consultants were used to complete a pay study review, assist with developing a three year strategic plan and to identify profit enhancement initiatives. Acquisition costs incurred in 2019 and 2018 total $1.28 million and $742.1 thousand respectively with expenses being recorded in multiple line items. Core deposit intangible expense which is included in the other general and administrative line decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 by $7.0 thousand; however, increased in 2019 compared to 2018 by $560.0 thousand with the acquisition. Advertising and public relations decreased in 2020 by $237.0 thousand with many events canceled due to the pandemic; however, had increased in 2019 by $682 thousand over 2018. With the addition of new offices in both years behind the increases, 2020 was expected to increase due to additional offices being added. The Bank also celebrates the anniversary of office openings with a special event in each community.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Provision expense increased by $5.8 million for 2020 as compared to 2019 and $814 thousand for 2019 as compared to 2018. The large increase in provision expense for 2020 was attributable to the uncertainties associated with COVID-19 and its effects on the ability of individuals, businesses and other entities to meet their financial obligations. Therefore, it is prudent to incorporate the impact of COVID-19 in the evaluation of the adequacy of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL). The restaurant and hospitality sectors have been hit especially hard. Risk in the Consumer and 1-4 Family Portfolio has increased but the full impact remains unknown. Increases to the Bank’s ALLL centered around current customers and businesses that are particularly vulnerable and qualitative factors were adjusted accordingly. Management continues to monitor asset quality, making adjustments to the provision as necessary. The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2019 over 2018 was due primarily to the level of charge-offs and the overall growth in the loan portfolio year over year. The consumer portfolios had the highest levels of charge-off activity in 2020, 2019 and 2018 at $380, $491 and $359 thousand respectively. Net charge offs in the consumer portfolio were $240, $371 and $245 thousand for 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. Total net charge-offs were $537, $685 and $417 thousand for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company segregates its Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) into two reserves: The ALLL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit (AULC). When combined, these reserves constitute the total ACL. The AUCL is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Bank’s ALLL methodology captures trends in leading, current, and lagging indicators which will directly affect the Bank’s allocation amount. The Bank monitors trends in such leading indicators as delinquency, unemployment changes in the Bank’s service area, experience and ability of staff, regulatory trends, and credit concentrations. A current indicator such as the total watch list loan amount to Capital, and a lagging indicator such as the charge off amount are referenced as well. A matrix formed by loan type from these indicators is used in making ALLL adjustments.
Watch list loan balances are comprised of loans graded 5-8. At year-end December 31, 2020 these loans totaled $56.3 million and were $3.9 million lower than December 31, 2019. Grade 5 decreased $6.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 and Grade 6 increased by $2.2 million in the same comparison. Grade 7 increased a mere $29 thousand in 2020 as compared to 2019.
At year-end December 31, 2019, the watch list loans totaled $60.2 million and were $52.3 million higher than December 31, 2018. Grade 5 increased $19.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 and grade 6 increased by $32.2 million in the same comparison. Grade 7 increased $200 thousand in 2019 as compared to 2018. Much of the total increase in 2019, $33.4 million, is in the agricultural real estate portfolio which expanded with the acquired loan portfolio.
The watch list loans as of December 31, 2018 totaled $7.9 million. Grade 5 loans were $3.8 million, Grade 6 were $3.2 million and Grade 7 loans were $886.0 thousand.
At December 31, 2020, 31.2% of the watch list was classified as special mention, with an additional 66.8% classified as substandard and a small 2.0% or $1.1 million of the $56.3 million watch list was classified as doubtful. At year-end 2019, 39.3% of the watch list was classified as special mention, with an additional 58.9% classified as substandard. A small 1.8% or $1.1 million of the $60.2 million watch list was classified as doubtful.
Of the aggregate watch list loan balances, as of December 31, 2018, special mention accounted for 47.5% with substandard comprising 41.4% and doubtful accounting for the final 11.1%.
In response to these fluctuations and loan growth during 2018 through 2020, the Bank’s ALLL to outstanding loan coverage percentage changed to 1.05% as of December 31, 2020, 0.59% as of December 31, 2019, and 0.80% as of December 31, 2018. In addition, for 2020 and 2019 our allowance for loan and lease losses does not include a $1.7 and $2.1 million credit mark, respectively associated with the Limberlost acquisition, which further supports the current position of the ALLL.
The above indicators impacting the ALLL are reviewed at a minimum quarterly. Some of the indicators are quantifiable and, as such, will automatically adjust the ALLL once calculated. These indicators include the ratio of past due loans to total loans, loans past due greater than 30 days, and the ratio of watch list loans to capital, with the watch list made up of loans graded 5, 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 (best) to 7 (worst). Other indicators consist of more subjective data used to evaluate the potential for inherent losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio. For example, the economic indicator uses the unemployment statistics from the communities in our market area to help determine whether the ALLL should be adjusted. At the end of each of 2018 and 2019 improvements were noted in unemployment figures. In 2020, a COVID-19 factor was added and adjusted during the year.
All commercial and agricultural relationships with lines of credit greater than $50,000 and aggregate loan exposure greater than $250,000 are reviewed annually by the Bank’s Credit Department. All commercial and agricultural relationships with term debt only and aggregate loan exposure greater than $750,000 are also reviewed by the Bank’s Credit Department. These reviews are conducted to identify early signs of deterioration.
To establish the specific reserve allocation for real estate, a discount to the market value is established to account for liquidation expenses. The discounting percentage used for real estate mirrors the discounting of real estate as provided for in the Bank’s Loan Policy. However, unique or unusual circumstances may be present which will affect the real estate value and, when appropriately identified, can adjust the discounting percentage at the discretion of management.
The ACL increased $6.6 million during 2020 while increasing $658 thousand and decreasing $46 thousand during 2019 and 2018 respectively. The percentage of ACL to the total loan portfolio was 0.83% as of December 31, 2018 and 0.63% as of December 31, 2019, and 1.1% as of December 31, 2020. December 31, 2018 had the lowest loans past due 30+ day percentage at 0.09% in the last ten years. December 31, 2019 and 2020 were still at respectable lows of 0.18% and 0.29%.
Please see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statement for additional tables regarding the composition of the ACL.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $751 thousand more for 2020 than 2019 as result of approximately $2.4 million of additional income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, became effective for the Company’s 2018 fiscal year and created a single corporate tax rate of 21%. Effective tax rates were 20.28%, 19.15% and 18.09%, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The effect of tax-exempt interest from holding tax-exempt securities and Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs) was $150, $182 and $229 thousand for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively less the TEFRA adjustments of $4, $12 and $8 thousand respectively. One of the benefits from the establishment of the Captive subsidiary was a lower effective tax rate.
Material Changes in Financial Condition
The shifts in the balance sheet during 2020 through 2018 have positioned the Company for continued improvement in profitability. On the asset side, interest income increased primarily from loan growth with funding for the increase provided by growth in core deposits and growth in other borrowings primarily related to the acquisition of the Bank of Geneva. The cost of funds has been impacted by the increase of both interest bearing liabilities and the pressure on rates from competition for funds. In 2020, the rate pressure from competition basically subsided. Increased balances in non-interest bearing deposits aided in profitability also. Loan growth and a widened net interest margin contributed to improved profitability in 2019 and 2018. With the rate decreases in 2020, net interest margin decreased 18 basis points compared to 2019.
Average earning assets increased in balances through 2020 and 2019. Loan growth in both years was the main factor.
Securities
The investment portfolio is primarily used to provide overall liquidity for the Bank. It is also used to provide required collateral for pledging to the Bank’s Ohio public depositors for amounts on deposit in excess of the FDIC coverage limits. It may also be used to pledge for additional borrowings from third parties. Investments are made with the above criteria in mind while still seeking a fair market rate of return and looking for maturities that fall within the projected overall strategy of the Bank. The possible need to fund future loan growth is also a consideration.
During 2016, the Bank began to utilize Promontory’s ICS, product to replace pledged securities; thereby increasing liquidity. ICS utilizes a nation-wide bank network to provide FDIC insurance coverage to the Bank’s depositors. The Bank is using the product to replace pledged securities to the Bank’s Ohio public customers and for commercial sweep customers previously utilizing daily repurchase agreements to protect balances over $250 thousand. The majority of the commercial accounts converted in 2017.
All of the Bank’s security portfolio is categorized as available for sale and as such is recorded at market value.
Security balances as of December 31 are summarized below:
The following table sets forth the maturities of investment securities as of December 31, 2020 and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated on the basis of cost and effective yields weighted for the scheduled maturity of each security. Tax-equivalent adjustments, using a twenty-one percent rate, have been made in yields on obligations of state and political subdivisions. Stocks of domestic corporations have not been included. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities are based on the stated maturity date of the security. Due to prepayments, actual maturities may be different.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank did not hold a large block of any one investment security in excess of 10% of stockholders’ equity. The largest segment of holdings is in U.S. Government agencies. The Bank also holds stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and Indianapolis at a cost of $5.8 million. This is required in order to obtain Federal Home Loan Bank loans.
Loan Portfolio
The Bank’s various loan portfolios are subject to varying levels of credit risk. Management mitigates these risks through portfolio diversification and through standardization of lending policies and procedures.
Risks are mitigated through an adherence to the Bank’s loan policies, with any exception being recorded and approved by senior management or committees comprised of senior management. The Bank’s loan policies define parameters to essential underwriting guidelines such as loan-to-value ratio, cash flow and debt-to-income ratio, loan requirements and covenants, financial information tracking, collection practice and others. The maximum loan amount to any one borrower is limited by the Bank’s legal lending limits and is stated in policy. On a broader basis, the Bank restricts total aggregate funding in comparison to Bank capital to any one business or agricultural sector by an approved sector percentage to capital limitation.
The following table shows the Bank’s loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, by category of loan as of December 31st of each year, net of deferred fees and costs:
The following table shows the maturity of loans excluding fair value adjustments as of December 31, 2020:
The following table presents the total of loans excluding fair value adjustments due after one year which has either 1) predetermined interest rates (fixed) or 2) floating or adjustable interest rates (variable):
The following table summarizes the Company’s nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing loans, and accruing troubled debt restructurings as of December 31 for each of the last five years:
Although loans may be classified as non-performing, some pay on a regular basis, and many continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than original contractual rates. Interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of these loans would have aggregated $272 thousand for 2020, $193 for 2019 and $99 thousand for 2018. Any collections of interest on nonaccrual loans are included in interest income when collected unless it is on an impaired loan with a specific allocation. A collection of interest on an impaired loan with a specific allocation is applied to the loan balance to decrease the allocation. Total interest collections, whether on an accrued or cash basis, amounted to $269 thousand for 2020, $117 thousand for 2019 and $69 thousand for 2018.
Loans are placed on nonaccrual status in the event that the loan is in past due status for more than 90 days or payment in full of principal and interest is not expected. The Bank had nonaccrual loan balances of $9.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to balances of $3.4 million and $542.0 thousand as of year-end 2019 and 2018. All of the balances of nonaccrual loans for the past three years were collaterally secured.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $56.3 million of loans which it considers to be “potential problem loans” in that the borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties which are not reflected in the table above. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had $60.2 million of these loans. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $7.9 million of these loans. These loans are subject to constant management attention and are reviewed at least monthly. The amount of the potential problem loans was considered in management’s review of the loan loss reserve at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
In extending credit to families, businesses and governments, banks accept a measure of risk against which an allowance for possible loan loss is established by way of expense charges to earnings. This expense is determined by management based on a detailed monthly review of the risk factors affecting the loan portfolio, including general economic conditions, changes in the portfolio mix, past due loan-loss experience and the financial condition of the bank’s borrowers.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had loans outstanding to individuals and firms engaged in the various fields of agriculture in the amount of $94.4 million with an additional $189.2 million in agricultural real estate loans which compared to $111.8 and $199.1 million respectively as of December 31, 2019. The ratio of this segment of loans to the total loan portfolio is not considered unusual for a bank engaged in and servicing rural communities.
Interest rate modification to reflect a decrease in market interest rates or maintain a relationship with the debtor, where the debtor is not experiencing financial difficulty and can obtain funding from other sources, is not considered a troubled debt restructuring. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $6.5 million of its loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings, of which $5.6 million are included in non-accrual loans. This compares to $956.3 thousand of troubled debt restructurings, of which $50.3 thousand are included in non-accrual loans for 2019 and $178.1 thousand of troubled debt restructuring, of which $74.4 thousand are included in non-accrual loans for 2018.
Updated appraisals are required on all collateral dependent loans once they are deemed impaired. The Bank may also require an updated appraisal of a watch list loan which the Bank monitors under their loan policy. On a quarterly basis, Bank management reviews properties supporting asset dependent loans to consider market events that may indicate a change in value has occurred.
To determine observable market value, collateral asset values securing an impaired loan are periodically evaluated. Maximum time of re-evaluation is every 12 months for chattels and titled vehicles and every two years for real estate. In this process, third party evaluations are obtained and heavily relied upon. Until such time that updated appraisals are received, the Bank may discount the existing collateral value used.
Performing “non-watch list” loans secured in whole or in part by real estate, do not require an updated appraisal unless the loan is rewritten and additional funds advanced. Watch List loans secured in whole or in part by real estate require updated appraisals every two years. All loans are subject to loan to values as found in the Bank’s loan policies irrespective of their
grade. The Bank’s watch list is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and any questions to value are addressed at that time.
The majority of the Bank’s loans are made in the market by lenders who live and work in the market. Thus, their evaluation of the independent valuation is also valuable and serves as a double check.
On extremely rare occasions, the Bank will make adjustments to the recorded values of collateral securing commercial real estate loans without acquiring an updated appraisal for the subject property. The Bank has no formalized policy for determining when collateral value adjustments between regularly scheduled appraisals are necessary, nor does it use any specific methodology for applying such adjustments. However, on a quarterly basis as part of its normal operations, the Bank’s senior management and the Loan Review Committee will meet to review all commercial credits either deemed to be impaired or on the Bank’s watch list. In addition to analyzing the recent performance of these loans, management and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee will also consider any general market conditions that might warrant adjustments to the value of particular real estate collateralizing commercial loans. In addition, management conducts annual reviews of all commercial loans exceeding certain outstanding balance thresholds. In each of these situations, any information available to management regarding market conditions impacting a specific property or other relevant factors are considered, and lenders familiar with a particular commercial real estate loan and the underlying collateral may be present to provide their opinion on such factors. If the available information leads management to conclude a valuation adjustment is warranted, such an adjustment may be applied on the basis of the information available. If management concludes that an adjustment is warranted but lacks the specific information needed to reasonably quantify the adjustment, management will order a new appraisal on the subject property even though one may not be required under the Bank’s general policies for updating appraisal.
Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements may also be reviewed for additional tables dealing with the Bank’s loans and ALLL.
ALLL is evaluated based on an assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This assessment results in an allowance consisting of two components, allocated and unallocated.
Management considers several different risk assessments in determining ALLL. The allocated component of ALLL reflects expected losses resulting from an analysis of individual loans, developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category. For those loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification and management can reasonably estimate the loss that will be sustained based upon collateral, the borrowers operating activity and economic conditions in which the borrower operates, a specific allocation is made. For those borrowers that are not currently behind in their payment, but for which management believes, based on economic conditions and operating activities of the borrower, the possibility exists for future collection problems, a reserve is established. The amount of reserve allocated to each loan portfolio is based on past loss experiences and the different levels of risk within each loan portfolio. The historical loan loss portion is determined using a historical loss analysis by loan category.
The unallocated portion of the reserve for loan losses is determined based on management’s assessment of general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors in the Bank’s marketing area. This assessment inherently involves a higher degree of uncertainty. It represents estimated inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio that are probable due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower’s financial condition and other current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in the Bank’s historical loss factors used to determine the allocated component of the allowance.
Actual charge-off of loan balances is based upon periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio by management. These evaluations consider several factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, financial condition of the borrower, and collateral.
As presented in the table on the next page, charge-offs decreased to $720 thousand for 2020. 52.8% of the charge-offs stemmed from the consumer related portfolios. Charge-offs were $841 thousand for 2019, $580 thousand for 2018, preceded by $288 thousand for 2017 and $550 thousand for 2016. Recoveries were $183 thousand in 2020 compared to $156, $163, $150 and $156 thousand for 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The net charge-offs for the last five years were all under $700 thousand. 2017 was the lowest at $138 thousand.
Higher provision expense was used to fund the ALLL for loan growth in 2016 and 2019. 2020 had higher provision expense due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on individuals and businesses. For 2017 and 2018, the provision was used to replenish the balance decreased by the net charge-off activity. Overall, the ALLL increased from $6.8 million at year-end 2016 to $13.7 million at year-end 2020. After adding the allowance for unfunded loan commitments, the ACL ended
2020 at $14.3 million. As the ratios on the bottom of the following table show, the trends for each have improved or remained constant over the five years shown. Asset quality and the ACL are both strong and emphasize the level of credit quality.
In reviewing the bigger picture of the allowance for credit loss, the years with the higher percentage of ACL to total nonperforming loans ratio account for the lower level of nonaccrual and watch list loans. This demonstrates the extended time period with which it has taken to achieve resolution and/or collection of these loans. The ratio of ACL to nonperforming loans increased beginning in 2016 with a significant drop in 2019 followed by a slight drop in 2020. 2020’s provision expense was the highest of the five years shown largely due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. Loan growth occurred in 2020 and 2019 reaching a double-digit percentage increase like 2016. The ACL to nonperforming loans for all years remained more than adequate and emphasizes the existing strong level of credit quality.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
*Nonperforming loans are defined as all loans on nonaccrual, plus any loans past due 90 days not on nonaccrual.
Allocation of ALLL per Loan Category in terms of dollars and percentage of loans in each category to total loans is as follows:

The following table presents the average amount of and average rate paid on each deposit category:
Liquidity
Liquidity remains adequate and up from prior years as the Bank has increased the investment portfolio in 2019 and 2020. Prior to 2019, the investment portfolio decreased to fund loans. The Bank has access to $148.1 million of unsecured borrowings through correspondent banks and $206.7 million of unpledged securities which may be sold or used as collateral. The amount of unpledged securities increased almost $90.4 million as compared to 2019. For the Bank, an additional $7.4 million is also available from the Federal Home Loan Bank based on current collateral pledging. At the present time, only 1-4
family and home equity portfolios are pledged. Additional borrowings would be available if additional portfolios (i.e. commercial real estate) were pledged.
Maintaining sufficient funds to meet depositor and borrower needs on a daily basis continues to be among management’s top priorities. This is accomplished not only by immediate liquid resources of cash, due from banks and federal funds sold, but also by the Bank’s available for sale securities portfolio. The average aggregate balance of these assets was $244.0 for 2020, $196.9 for 2019 and $195.2 million for 2018. This represented 13.8%, 13.1%, and 17.6% of total average assets, respectively. Of the almost $289.9 million of debt securities in the Bank’s portfolio as of December 31, 2020, $330.8 thousand, or 0.1% of the portfolio, is expected to receive payments or mature in 2021. This liquidity provides the opportunity to fund loan growth by analysis of the lowest cost and source of funds whether by increasing deposits, sales or runoff of investments or utilizing debt.
In addition to the Bank’s investment portfolio, the Company has $17.9 million held in the holding company’s investment portfolio. $805.7 thousand of those investments will mature or receive payments in the next twelve months. These funds provide liquidity to the Company. The Bank has been declaring additional dividends each quarter to provide this liquidity to the Company. The Captive has also upstreamed dividends to the Company and is expected to continue annually as long as reserve levels are adequately provided for. This provides additional liquidity for Company activities. The Company sold securities in December 2018 to provide $8.5 million in cash for the preparation of the acquisition on January 1, 2019.
Historically, the primary source of liquidity has been core deposits that include noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits, savings, money market accounts and time deposits of individuals. Core deposit balances increased in all categories with the exception of time deposits as of December 31, 2020 compared to same date 2019. Average total savings balances increased $158.8 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. Core deposit balances as of year-end 2019 increased in categories as compared to 2018. Overall deposits increased an average of $299.7 million in 2019 and $41.7 million in 2018. The Bank utilized Federal Funds purchased at times during 2018 through 2020. The average balance for 2020 was $2.2 million, for 2019 and 2018 was $2.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The Bank is comfortable accessing these funds on a regular basis.
Historically, the primary use of new funds is placing the funds back into the community through loans for the acquisition of new homes, consumer products and for business development. The use of new funds for loans is measured by the loan to deposit ratio. The Bank’s average loan to deposit ratio was 90.7% for 2020, 91.8% for 2019 and 89.4% for 2018. The Bank’s goal is for this ratio to be higher in the 80-90 percent range with loan growth being the driver. The Bank ended the year 2020 at an 81.8% loan to deposit ratio.
Short-term debt such as federal funds purchased, and securities sold under agreement to repurchase also provides the Company with liquidity. Short-term debt for both federal funds purchased, and securities sold under agreement to repurchase amounted to $30.2 million at December 31, 2020, $48.1 million at December 31, 2019, and $32.2 million at the end of 2018. These accounts are used to provide a sweep product to the Bank’s commercial customers and for some term deposits. The repurchase agreements are for term deposits only.
“Other borrowings” are also a source of funds. Other borrowings consist of loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and Indianapolis. These funds are then used to provide loans in our community. On January 1, 2019, the Bank acquired $49.5 million of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. During 2020 and 2019, $7.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively matured and was paid off.
Asset/Liability Management
The primary functions of asset/liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. It involves the management of the balance sheet mix, maturities, re-pricing characteristics and pricing components to provide an adequate and stable net interest margin with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates.
Changes in net income, other than those related to volume arise when interest rates on assets re-price in a time frame or interest rate environment that is different from that of the re-pricing period for liabilities. Changes in net interest income also arise from changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Historically, the Bank has maintained liquidity through cash flows generated in the normal course of business, loan repayments, maturing earning assets, the acquisition of new deposits, and borrowings. The Bank's asset and liability management program is designed to maximize net interest income over the long term while taking into consideration both
credit and interest rate risk. Interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Overnight federal funds on which rates change daily and loans that are tied to the market rate differ considerably from long-term investment securities and fixed rate loans. Similarly, time deposits over $100,000 and money market certificates are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings accounts. The Bank utilizes shock analysis to examine the amount of exposure an instant rate change of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points in both increasing and decreasing directions would have on the financials. Acceptable ranges of earnings and equity at risk are established and decisions are made to maintain those levels based on the shock results.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company’s operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company’s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and service.
Contractual Obligations
Contractual Obligations of the Company totaled $298.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Time deposits represent contractual agreements for certificates of deposits held by its customers. Long term debt represents the borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank and is further defined in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Capital Resources
Stockholders’ equity was $249.2 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $230.3 million at December 31, 2019. Dividends declared during 2020 were $0.66 per share totaling $7.3 million and dividends declared during 2019 were $0.61 per share totaling $6.7 million. Throughout 2020, the Company awarded 37,382 shares of restricted stock awards to 92 employees. During 2019, the Company awarded 38,100 shares of restricted stock to 94 employees. For a summary of activity as it relates to the Company’s restricted stock awards, please refer to Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans in the consolidated financial statements. On December 31, 2020 the Company held 1,032,456 shares in Treasury Stock and 88,226 unvested shares of restricted stock. At year-end 2019, the Company held 1,093,065 shares in Treasury stock and 88,450 unvested shares of restricted stock. On January 15, 2021 the Company announced the authorization by its Board of Directors for the Company’s repurchase, either on the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions, of up to 500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock commencing January 15, 2021 and ending December 31, 2021. The Company has a history of approving a similar resolution to be in effect each year for at least the last five years.
The Company continues to have a strong capital base and maintains regulatory capital ratios that are above the defined regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had total risk-based capital ratio of 12.64%. Core capital to risk-based asset ratio of 11.63% for the Bank, is well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Bank’s leverage ratio of 9.08% is also substantially in excess of regulatory guidelines. Under Basel III, the common equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets ratio is also well above the required 4.50% and the 6.50% well capitalized levels with the Bank at 11.63%. As a result of the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) in 2018, the Company is no longer subject to regulatory capital ratio requirements as long as its total consolidating assets are less than $3.0 billion. For further discussion and analysis of regulatory capital requirements, refer to Note 15 of the Audited Financial Statements.
The Company’s subsidiaries are restricted by regulations from making dividend distributions in excess of certain prescribed amounts. Upon prior regulatory approval, the Bank may be allowed to pay above the prescribed amount.
