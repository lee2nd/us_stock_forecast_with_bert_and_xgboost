Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As of January 31, 2021, we had total assets of $20,172 and total liabilities of $91,501. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.
We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
We discontinued our cedar phyto barrels distribution business upon the change in control occurred on November 21, 2018 and started to implement a new business plan to pursue business opportunities in manufacturing and distribution of certain dietary ingredient and nutritional supplement products.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Our independent auditor’s report accompanying our January 31, 2021 and 2020 audited financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. This assumption may, however, not hold true for a variety of reasons, many of which are out of our control.
As at January 31, 2021 our current assets were $19,894 compared to $5,999 in current assets at January 31, 2020. As at January 31, 2021, our total assets were $20,172 compared to $6,277 in total assets at January 31, 2020. As at January 31, 2021, our current liabilities were $91,501, or an increase in the amount of $18,509 (or 25.36%) compared to $72,992 as of January 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2021, we had loan from stockholder in the total amount of $80,001, or 87.43% of our total liabilities, as we have not been able to generate a steady cash flow to cover our operating expenses and have to rely heavily on the financial support from our stockholder.
Total stockholders’ deficit was $71,329 as of January 31, 2021, compared to $66,715 as of January 31, 2020, representing an increase in the amount of $4,614.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING
We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Currently we are financed by our major stockholder. Our working capital requirements for the next 12 months are expected to increase if and when we are able to execute on our current business plan. As of January 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit in the amount of $71,607.
We also intend to finance our operating expenses and business development costs with further issuances of securities and debt issuances. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
MATERIAL COMMITMENTS
As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.
PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus entitled COVID-19 emerged in China and spread to other countries including to the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a public health pandemic of international concern, which has resulted in travel restrictions and in some cases, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets.
In the United States in which we and our customers, and partners operate, the health concerns as well as political or governmental developments in response to COVID-19 could result in economic, social or labor instability or prolonged contractions in certain end markets. These events could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations and financial condition.
At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business or operating results, which is highly dependent on uncertain future developments, including the severity of the pandemic and the actions taken or to be taken by governments and private businesses in relation to its containment. The Company’s plan pf conducting new businesses might be delayed and the effect of the outbreak may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.
