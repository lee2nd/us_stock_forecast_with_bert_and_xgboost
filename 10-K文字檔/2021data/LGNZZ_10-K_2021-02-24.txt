Results of Operations
Revenue
Royalty revenue is a function of our partners' product sales and the applicable royalty rate. Kyprolis royalty rate is under a tiered royalty rate structure with the highest being 3.0%. Evomela has a fixed royalty rate of 20%. On March 6, 2019, we sold all of our rights, title and interest in and to the Promacta license to RPI. Subsequent to March 6, 2019, we no longer recognize revenue related to sales of Promacta. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note (2), Sale of Vernalis R&D and Promacta License.”
Royalty revenue decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 driven primarily by the above mentioned sale of the Promacta license in March 2019, which contributed $14.2 million revenue in 2019. In addition, royalties for 2020 were impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Captisol sales increased year over year in 2020 primarily reflecting higher sales of Captisol for use in the manufacturing of Veklury. Contract revenue increased slightly year over year in 2020.
The following table represents royalty revenue by program:
Operating Costs and Expenses
Total operating costs and expenses for 2020 increased $51.7 million or 41% compared with 2019.
Cost of Captisol increased year over year in 2020 primarily due to higher sales of Captisol during 2020.
Amortization of intangibles increased year over year in 2020 primarily due to the acquisitions of Icagen in April 2020 and Pfenex in October 2020.
At any one time, we are working on multiple programs. As such, we generally do not track our R&D expenses on a specific program basis. Our R&D expenses increased year over year in 2020 due to the costs associated with our acquisitions of Icagen in April 2020 and Pfenex in October 2020, which primarily consisted of salaries and lab costs and intangible amortizations associated with Icagen ($10.4 million) and Pfenex ($13.5 million). The increases were partially offset by a $17.0 million year over year decreases in amortization of other economic rights, primarily consisting of economic rights acquired from Palvella in December 2018 and Novan in February 2019.
General and administrative expenses increased year over year in 2020 primarily due to $20.7 million acquisition and integration related expenses associated with the Pfenex acquisition.
We do not provide forward-looking estimates of costs and time to complete our ongoing research and development projects as such estimates would involve a high degree of uncertainty. Uncertainties include our inability to predict the outcome of research and clinical studies, regulatory requirements placed upon us by regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA, our inability to predict the decisions of our partners, our ability to fund research and development programs, competition from other entities of which we may become aware in future periods, predictions of market potential for products that may be derived from our work, and our ability to recruit and retain personnel or third-party contractors with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform certain research. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional discussion of the uncertainties surrounding our research and development initiatives.
Other income (expense)
The fluctuation in the gain (loss) from short-term investments is primarily driven by the changes in the fair value of our ownership in Viking common stock and warrants (an unrealized loss of $19.0 million in 2020 as compared to an unrealized gain of $2.9 million in 2019).
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our short-term investments. The year over year decrease in 2020 resulted from the decrease in our short-term investment balances due to the usage of funds in share repurchases, the 2023 Notes repurchase and the acquisitions of Icagen, xCella, Taurus and Pfenex during 2020 as well as lower interest rates during 2020.
Interest expense includes the 0.75% coupon cash interest expense in addition to the non-cash accretion of discount (including the amortization of debt issuance costs) on our 2023 Notes. The year over year decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower average debt outstanding balance as compared to the prior year. The 2019 Notes were paid off upon the maturity date in August 2019. During 2020, we repurchased $254.7 million in principal of the 2023 Notes for $222.8 million in cash, including accrued interest of $0.6 million. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note (7), Convertible Senior Notes.”
Other expense, net, decreased year over year in 2020 primarily due to a $5.1 million reduction in the value of our Selexis commercial license right in 2019. See additional information in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note (1), Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Commercial License and Other Economic Rights.”
Income tax benefit (expense)
Our effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 72% and 21%, respectively. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as the U.S. federal and state statutory tax rates and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. In 2020, the variance from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, primarily the United Kingdom. The items below also had an impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. rate.
•$2.4 million (22.9%) increase from Section 162(m) limitation
•$1.7 million (15.7%) decrease from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction
•$1.5 million (13.8%) increase from state income taxes
•$0.9 million (8.3%) increase due to non-deductible transaction costs primarily related to the acquisition of Pfenex
•$0.7 million (6.6%) decrease from research and development tax credits
•$0.3 million (3.4%) decrease due to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation which are recorded as a discrete item within the provision for income tax pursuant to ASU 2016-09
•$1.2 million (0.1%) decrease due to the release of a valuation allowance primarily relating to research and development tax credits.
•$0.9 million (0.1%) decrease from research and development tax credits
•$0.8 million (0.1%) decrease due to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation which are recorded as a discrete item within the provision for income tax pursuant to ASU 2016-09
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $411.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $658.7 million from last year, due to factors described in the "Cash Flow Summary" below. Our primary source of liquidity, other than our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which decreased during 2020 primarily from the acquisitions of Icagen, xCella, Taurus and Pfenex, has been cash flows from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating, investing, and financing needs.
Historically, we have liquidated our short-term investments and/or issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities. Our short-term investments include U.S. government debt securities, investment-grade corporate debt securities, mutual funds and certificates of deposit. We have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities of our investments in order to provide both safety and liquidity. These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates. Additionally, we own certain securities which are classified as short-term investments that we received as a result of a milestone and an upfront license payment as well as 5.8 million shares of common stock in Viking.
In August 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes with aggregate principal amount of $245.0 million. During 2018, $217.7 million in principal of the 2019 Notes were converted into cash. In June 2019, we received notices for conversion of $1.0 million of principal amount of the 2019 Notes, which were settled in cash upon the 2019 Notes' maturity date in August 2019. On August 15, 2019, the 2019 Notes maturity date, we paid the noteholders the remaining $26.3 million principal amount.
In May 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million. A portion of the proceeds from such issuance totaling $49.7 million were used to repurchase 260,000 shares of our common stock. During 2020, we repurchased $254.7 million in principal of the 2023 Notes for $222.8 million in cash, including accrued interest of $0.6 million. After the repurchases, $495.3 million in principal amount of the 2023 Notes remain outstanding. We may continue to use cash on hand to repurchase additional 2023 Notes through open-market transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to facilitate open-market repurchases, or otherwise, from time to time. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by management based on the evaluation of market conditions, trading price of the 2023 Notes, legal requirements and other factors. The 2023 Notes were not convertible as of December 31, 2020. It is our intent and policy to settle conversions through combination settlement, which essentially involves payment in cash equal to the principal portion and delivery of shares of common stock for the excess of the conversion value over the principal portion. See detail in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note (7), Convertible Senior Notes.”
In September 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock from time to time over a period of up to three years. On January 23, 2019, our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $150.0 million. The available amount under the $350.0 million repurchase plan was fully utilized during the third quarter of 2019.
On September 11, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock from time to time over the next three years. We expect to acquire shares primarily through open-market transactions and have entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, and may enter into additional Rule 10b5-1 trading plans in the future, to facilitate open-market repurchases. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements and other factors. Our prior $350.0 million stock repurchase program mentioned above was terminated in connection with the approval of the new stock repurchase program. Authorization to repurchase $248.8 million of our common stock remained available as of December 31, 2020. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities.”
We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; continued advancement of research and development efforts; potential stock repurchases; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and strategic investments.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $49.1 million in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with the acquisitions to be settled in future periods.
Cash Flow Summary
In 2020, we generated cash from operations, from the sale of Vernalis R&D business and from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the year we used cash for investing activities, including the acquisition of Pfenex, Icagen, xCella and Taurus. We also used cash for financing activities, including the payments related to the extinguishment of certain 2023 Notes and stock repurchases.
In 2019, we generated $827 million from the sale of the Promacta license (including $14.2 million recorded to revenue related to the Promacta royalty for the period between January 1, 2019 and March 6, 2019), used cash for net purchases of short-term investments, used $453.0 million to repurchase our common stock, used $103.8 million to pay federal and state estimated income taxes, paid off the remaining balance of the 2019 Notes in the amount of $27.3 million, paid $12.0 million for the purchase of Novan economic rights and paid $11.8 million for the Ab Initio acquisition (net of cash acquired).
In 2018, we generated cash from operations, from issuance of the 2023 Notes and associated warrants, and from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used cash for investing activities, including the acquisition of commercial rights, net purchases of short-term investments, payments made to acquire Vernalis, payments to CVR holders and capital expenditures. We also used cash for financing activities, including principal payments related to conversions of the 2019 Notes, payments to purchase the bond hedge associated with the 2023 Notes, payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards and to repurchase shares of our common stock.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we were not involved in any “off-balance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the SEC.
We lease our office facilities under operating lease arrangements with varying terms through March 2024. The agreements provide for increases in annual rents based on changes in the Consumer Price Index or fixed percentage increases of 3.0%. We had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):
(1) Amounts represent our commitments under our supply agreement with Hovione for Captisol purchases.
(2) Amounts represent contractual amounts due under our 2023 Notes, including interest based on the fixed rate of 0.75% per year.
(3) We lease two office facilities, which we have fully vacated under operating lease arrangements. The lease agreements expire on February 2023 and April 2024. We sublet the facilities through the end of our lease. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to receive aggregate future minimum lease payments totaling $1.0 million (non-discounted) over the duration of the sublease agreement, which are not included in the table above.
(4) Amounts represent our commitments under our finance lease agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note (1), Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, which amends the guidance for recognition of revenue from contracts with customers using the modified-retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We apply the following five-step model in order to determine the revenue: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
We receive royalty revenue on sales by our partners of products covered by patents that we or our partners own under the contractual agreements. We do not have future performance obligations under these license arrangements. We generally satisfy our obligation to grant intellectual property rights on the effective date of the contract. However, we apply the royalty recognition constraint required under the guidance for sales-based royalties which requires a sales-based royalty to be recorded no sooner than the underlying sale occurs. Therefore, royalties on sales of products commercialized by our partners are recognized in the quarter the product is sold. Our partners generally report sales information to us on a one quarter lag. Thus, we estimate the expected royalty proceeds based on an analysis of historical experience and interim data provided by our partners including their publicly announced sales. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenues, which have not been material, are adjusted in the period in which they become known, typically the following quarter.
Our contracts with customers often will include future contingent milestone based payments. We include contingent milestone based payments in the estimated transaction price when it is probable to estimate the amount of the payment. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated results and our best judgment at the time. If the contingent milestone based payment is sales-based, we apply the royalty recognition constraint and record revenue when the underlying sale has taken place. Significant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of intellectual property. Because of the risk that products in development with our partners will not reach development based milestones or receive regulatory approval, we generally recognize any contingent payments that would be due to us upon the development milestone or regulatory approval. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may also defer a portion of the consideration received if we have to satisfy a future obligation. We use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available.
For R&D services that we recognize over time, we measure our progress using an input method. The input methods we use are based on the effort we expend or costs we incur toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. We estimate the amount of effort we expend, including the time it will take us to complete the activities, or the costs we may incur in a given period, relative to the estimated total effort or costs to satisfy the performance obligation. This results in a percentage that we multiply by the transaction price to determine the amount of revenue we recognize each period. This approach requires us to make numerous estimates and use significant judgement. If our estimates or judgements change over the course of the collaboration, they may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in the current and future periods.
Revenue from Captisol sales is recognized when control of Captisol material or intellectual property license rights is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive from our customers in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. We consider a performance obligation satisfied once we have transferred control of the product, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the Captisol material or intellectual property license right. We recognize revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Sales tax and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. We have elected to recognize the cost of freight and shipping when control over Captisol material has transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of material sales. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. We did not incur any incremental costs of obtaining a contract during the periods reported.
We occasionally have sub-license obligations related to arrangements for which we receive license fees, milestones and royalties. We evaluate the determination of gross as a principal versus net as an agent reporting based on each individual agreement.
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessments
We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived assets are impaired. A review of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. If indicators of impairment exist, we first assess the impairment evaluation and then assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts if needed. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities.
In order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows, the time value of money, and other factors that a willing market participant would consider. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows.
Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit, we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
Contingent Liabilities
In October 2017, we acquired Crystal for total cash consideration of $27.2 million, plus contingent consideration of up to an additional $10.5 million ($5.8 million has been paid as of December 31, 2020) over a five year period following the acquisition date based on certain research milestones and a portion of the payments that we receive from a specified part of the historical Crystal business. The contingent consideration is measured at fair value using an income approach valuation technique, specifically with probability weighted and discounted cash flows. The fair value of the liability is assessed at each reporting date and the change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. The carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate significantly and actual amounts paid may be materially different than the carrying amount of the liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2020 was $0.8 million.
In connection with our acquisition of Metabasis in January 2010, we issued Metabasis stockholders four tradable CVRs, one CVR from each of four respective series of CVR, for each Metabasis share. The CVRs entitle Metabasis stockholders to cash payments as proceeds are received by us from the sale or partnering of any of the Metabasis drug development programs. The fair values of the CVRs are remeasured at each reporting date through the term of the related agreement. Changes in the fair values are reported in the statement of operations as income (decreases) or expense (increases). The carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate significantly based upon quoted market prices and actual amounts paid under the agreements may be materially different than the carrying amount of the liability.
On April 1, 2020, we acquired the core assets, including its partnered programs and ion channel technology from Icagen and certain of its affiliates for total cash consideration of $15.1 million, and a contingent earn-out payment of up to $25.0 million based on certain revenue milestones with an estimated fair value upon acquisition of $4.8 million. The fair value of the earn-out liability was determined using a probability weighted income approach incorporating the estimated future cash flows from expected future milestones. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate based on the market participants' cost of debt reflective of Icagen. The fair value of the liability is assessed at each reporting date and the change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. The carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate significantly and actual amounts paid may be materially different than the carrying amount of the liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2020 was $6.4 million.
On October 1, 2020, we acquired Pfenex, which develops next-generation and novel protein therapeutics to improve existing therapies and create new therapies for biological targets linked to critical, unmet diseases using a protein expression technology platform. The preliminary purchase price of $465.1 million included $429.6 million cash consideration paid upon acquisition, and a contingent CVR payment of up to $77.8 million of cash payments based on certain specified milestones with an estimated initial fair value of $37.0 million, net of $1.5 million recorded as post-acquisition expenses based on double trigger accelerate feature. The fair value of the CVR liability was determined using a probability adjusted income approach. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate based on the market participants' cost of debt reflective of Pfenex. The liability is periodically assessed based on events and circumstances related to the underlying milestone, and any change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the CVR liability as of December 31, 2020 was $37.6 million.
See additional information in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note (5), Fair Value Measurement.”
Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the United States are required in determining our provision for income taxes. Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes.
Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts, projections of pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
We recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions. Due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability. These differences, as well as any interest and penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined.
