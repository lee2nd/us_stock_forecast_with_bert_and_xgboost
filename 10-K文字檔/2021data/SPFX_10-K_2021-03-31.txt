ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.
Overview
We are an insurance premium financing company, specializing primarily in commercial policies. We make it efficient for companies to access financing for insurance premiums. Enabled by our network of marketing representatives and relationships with insurance agents, we provide a value-driven, customer-focused lending service.
We have offered premium financing since 1991 through our wholly owned subsidiary, Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation. We are generally targeting premium financing loans from $1,000 to $15,000, with repayment terms ranging from 6 to 10 months, although we may offer larger loans in cases we deem appropriate. Qualified customers may have multiple financings with us concurrently, which we believe provides opportunities for repeat business, as well as increased value to our customers.
We originate loans primarily in Florida, although we operate in several states. Over the past three years, the Company has expanded its operations, and currently is financing insurance premiums in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Tennessee and Arizona. We intend to continue to expand our market into new states as part of our organic growth trend. Loans are originated primarily through a network of insurance agents solicited by our in-house sales team and marketing representatives.
We generate the majority of our revenue through interest income and the associated fees earned from our loan products. We earn interest based on the “rule of 78” and earn other associated fees as applicable to each loan. These fees include, but are not limited to, a one-time finance charge, late fees, and NSF fees. Our company charges interest to its customers solely by the Rule of 78. Charging interest per the Rule of 78 is the industry standard among premium finance loans. The Rule of 78 is a method to calculate the amount of principal and interest paid by each payment on a loan with equal monthly payments. The Rule of 78 is a permissible method of calculating interest in the states in which we operate. The Rule of 78 recognizes greater amounts of interest income during the first months of the loan, while decreasing interest income during the final months of the loan. Whenever a loan is repaid prior to full maturity, the Rule of 78 methodology is applied and the borrower is refunded accordingly.
We rely on a diversified set of funding sources for the loans we make to our customers. Our primary source of financing has historically been a line of credit at a financial institution collateralized by our loan receivables. We receive additional funding from unsecured subordinate noteholders that pays monthly interest to the investors. We have also used proceeds from operating cash flow to fund loans in the past and continue to finance a portion of our outstanding loans with these funds. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding our financing strategy.
The Company’s main source of funding is its line of credit, which represented approximately 63% ($25,653,473) of its capital as of December 31, 2020. This line of credit was replaced with a new lender, First Horizon Bank, on February 3, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s subordinated notes payable represented approximately 20% ($8,029,465) of the Company’s capital, operating liabilities provide approximately 8% ($3,176,650) of the Company’s capital, preferred equity provides approximately 2% ($990,000) of the Company’s capital, the PPP loan represents approximately 1% ($271,000) of the Company’s capital, and equity in retained earnings and common paid-in capital represents the remaining 6% ($2,693,813) of the Company’s capital structure.
Key Financial and Operating Metrics
We regularly monitor a series of metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics aid us in developing and refining our growth strategies and making strategic decisions.
Gross Revenue
Gross Revenue represents the sum of interest and finance income, associated fees and other revenue.
Originations
Originations represent the total principal amount of Loans made during the period.
Interest Earned Rate
The Interest Earned Rate is the average annual percentage interest rate earned on new loans.
Cost of Funds Rate
Cost of Funds Rate is calculated as interest expense divided by average debt outstanding for the period, net of the interest related tax benefit.
Reserve Ratio
Reserve Ratio is our allowance for credit losses at the end of the period divided by the total amount of principal outstanding on Loans at the end of the period. It excludes net deferred origination costs and associated fees.
Provision Rate
Provision Rate equals the provision for credit losses for the period divided by originations for the period. Because we reserve for probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio upon origination, this rate is significantly impacted by the expectation of credit losses for the period’s originations volume. This rate is also impacted by changes in loss expectations for contract receivables originated prior to the commencement of the period.
Return on Assets
Return on Assets is calculated as annualized net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the period divided by average total assets for the period.
Return on Equity
Return on Equity is calculated as annualized net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the period divided by average stockholders’ equity attributable to common stockholders for the period.
RESULTS of OPERATIONS
Results of Operations for the Year ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year ended December 31. 2019
Revenue
Revenue increased by 2.0% overall or $127,226 to $6,434,182 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6,306,956 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue was primarily due to a 3.0% or $154,702 increase in finance charges, which were partially offset by a 10.0% or $33,921 decrease in revenue from origination charges. Revenue from finance charges comprised 81.8% of overall revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the company financed an additional $3,270,399 in new loan originations. This increase was due largely to increased marketing efforts throughout our established states. The Company experienced this growth despite the pandemic and does not expect any material decrease in revenue due to the end of the pandemic. The Company benefited from a swift transition to work-from-home during the early months of the COVID pandemic. The Company’s proprietary software allowed the Company to continue operating at full capacity, which gave us a competitive advantage in the first quarter of 2020 in attracting originations that may have otherwise gone to our competitors.
Under the terms of the line of credit agreement, the loan receivables and our other assets provide the collateral for the loan. As the receivables increase, driven by new sales, the company has greater borrowing power, giving it the opportunity generate additional sales. In July 2019, the company finalized negotiations to increase the credit commitment by an additional $2,500,000. However, although the Company experienced significant growth throughout 2020, originations were consistently constrained by the $27,500,000 limit on the Company’s previous line of credit. Management believes that the Company’s growth in revenues would have been higher with more access to capital. In January 2021, the Company executed a commitment letter with a new lender for a two-year $35,000,000 line of credit. See Future Cash Requirements for the Company’s strategy regarding its line of credit.
Expense
Expenses decreased by 4.1% or $233,809 to $5,456,488 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5,690,297 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The decrease in expenses was primarily due to decreases in the following categories:
·
$202,243 decrease in interest expense as a result of a reduction in the line of credit interest rate. This is the result of a significant reduction in the 30-day LIBOR rate used in calculating the Company’s interest on the line of credit during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, thus greatly reducing the cost of funds.
·
$137,977 decrease in bad debt expense as a result of management’s approach during 2019 to aggressively eliminate older, marginal receivables, rather than hold the accounts while they await collection.
The foregoing decreases were partially offset by an increase of $120,375 in salaries and wages primarily as a result of the hiring of additional staff.
Net Income before Taxes
Net Income before taxes increased by $361,035 to $977,694 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $616,659 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was attributable to the net increases and decreases as discussed above.
Income Tax Provision
Income tax provision increased $167,321 to $290,289 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $122,968 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in taxable income.
Net Income
Net Income increased by $193,714 to $687,405 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $493,691 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was attributable to the $361,035 increase in income before taxes related to increased business activity, partially offset by the $167,321 increase in the provision for income taxes related to increased taxable income.
Comparison of Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We received $1,296,702 of cash provided from our operating activities in 2020 compared to $4,602,023 used in our operating activities in 2019. The decrease in cash used of $5,898,725 was primarily due to a $5,846,537 decrease of cash used to support working capital components and a $52,188 increase of net income as adjusted for noncash items.
The $5,846,537 decrease of cash used to support working capital components was primarily the due to a $4,826,036 increase in the change in premium finance contracts, a $1,077,182 increase in the change in drafts payable, a $341,058 increase in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a $313,498 increase in the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets. These are natural fluctuations in operating accounts that occur during the normal course of business. The Company expects net cash outflows from operations during periods of growth. In 2019, the change in premium finance contracts was significantly larger as the Company grew to the full utilization of the line of credit. As discussed in the Revenues and Future Cash Requirements section, although the Company was able to continue to grow in 2020, the Company was effectively constrained by the limit of its previous line of credit agreement. The reduction in cash used to support working capital components was primarily related to curtailing the growth to stay within the maximum of the Company’s line of credit.
The $52,188 increase of cash from net earnings as adjusted by noncash items resulted primarily from an $193,714 increase in net income and $56,091 increase in noncash equity compensation, partially offset by a $137,977 decrease in bad debt expense.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We used $62,294 of cash in our investing activities in 2020 compared to $246,711 in cash used in 2019. The decrease in cash used of $184,417 is due primarily to a decrease in the payments made on the life insurance policy of $288,693, which was partially offset by $94,726 decrease in the repayment of loans receivable - related party. To assist in lowering its overall cost of funds, as of December 31, 2019, the Company fully repaid the higher interest rate loan on the life insurance policy with available funds from the bank’s line of credit. This repayment, in turn, increased the cash surrender value of the life insurance policy. We also aggressively reduced related party loans throughout 2019 in preparation of registering with the SEC. In 2020, the company has no remaining loans receivable - related party.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
We used $1,102,725 of cash in our financing activities in 2020 compared to $5,116,776 provided by financing activities in 2019. The decrease in funds provided of $6,219,501 is due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from the line of credit of $6,483,589, a decrease in proceeds from notes payable - others of $149,682, and an increase in repayments of notes payable - others of $137,300. These were partially offset by $320,000 proceeds from the sale of Series A convertible preferred stock and $271,000 of proceeds from the PPP loan. As discussed in the Revenues and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections, in 2019, the Company was limited in the amounts it could draw from its line of credit, due to reaching its maximum throughout 2020. The Company utilized this line of credit to increase new sales as well as repay principal on higher interest rate notes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company paid all outstanding accrued dividends on its preferred stock, with the fourth-quarter 2020 dividend being paid in January 2021.
LIQUIDITY and CAPITAL RESOURCES as of December 31, 2020
We had $477,289 cash and a working capital surplus of $8,462,937 at December 31, 2020. A significant working capital surplus is generally expected through the normal course of business due primarily to the difference between the balance in loan receivables and the related line of credit liability. As discussed in the Revenues section, the Company’s line of credit is currently the primary source of operating funds. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was using a $27,500,000 line of credit, which initially expired in October 2020. The Company received an extension on this line of credit until February 2021 due to ongoing negotiations to increase the line to $35,000,000 through a syndication with its current lender or a new prospective lender. In February 2021, the Company entered into a contract with a new lender, First Horizon Bank, for a two-year $35,000,000 line of credit. The terms of the new line of credit are generally more favorable than the previous line of credit, including an interest rate based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 2.85% with a minimum rate of 3.35%. The expiring line of credit has an interest rate based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 2.75% with a minimum rate of 3.75%. The Company believes that the interest rate will be based on the minimum rate for the term of the line of credit, which will lead to savings on interest expense over the term of the deal. Based on our estimates and taking into account the risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our businesses and repay our obligations as they become due for at least the next 12 months.
In April 2020, the Company received a $271,000 loan through the PPP program with the Small Business Administration. The Company proudly applied 100% of the proceeds of the loan to its main purpose of keeping their staff employed at the same level as before the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company maintained the same level of employment throughout 2020 with support from the PPP loan. As the Company used the proceeds of the loan on forgivable expenses, i.e. company payroll, the Company expects the loan to be fully forgiven. The Company applied for loan forgiveness in September 2020 and awaits a response from the SBA and the Company’s bank who facilitated the loan.
On December 31, 2020, the Company terminated a private placement memorandum for the sale of additional equity. Through this private placement, the Company raised $990,000. The additional equity can be further leveraged to negotiate increases on the line of credit, as well as seek out additional funding sources. The Company plans on using any surplus capital to fund a long-term merger and acquisition (roll-up) strategy.
Future Cash Requirements
As the Company anticipates its growth patterns to continue, a larger line of credit is paramount to fueling this growth. Throughout 2020, the Company had been curtailing its business prospects due to reaching its maximum on its current line of credit. As the main and cheapest source of funds, the previous bank’s inability to increase the line without a syndicated deal had restrained the Company’s growth potential in 2020. By securing a larger line of credit, the Company can satisfy the cash requirements anticipated by its future growth, rather than staying at the current sales level constrained by the previous line of credit. Coinciding with these goals, in February 2021, the Company entered into a contract with a new lender for a two-year $35,000,000 line of credit.
Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources
We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including costs associated with our premium finance loans, capital expenditures, debt repayments, acquisitions (if any), pursuing market expansion, supporting sales and marketing activities, and other general corporate purposes. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and repay our debt, we may elect to pursue additional financing activities such as refinancing or expanding existing debt or pursuing other debt or equity offerings to provide flexibility with our cash management and provide capital for potential acquisitions.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was contractually obligated as follows:
As of December 31, 2019, the Company was contractually obligated as follows:
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We consider the following to be our most critical accounting policy because it involves critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment:
Allowance for doubtful accounts
We are subject to the risk of loss associated with our borrowers’ inability to fulfill their payment obligations, the risk that we will not collect sufficient unearned premium refunds on the cancelled policies on the defaulted loans to fully cover the unpaid loan principal and the risk that payments due us from insurance agents and brokers will not be paid.
The carrying amount of the Premium Finance Contracts (“Contracts”) is reduced by an allowance for losses that are maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the Contracts. The amount of the allowance is based upon management’s evaluation of the collectability of the Contracts, including the nature of the accounts, credit concentration, trends, and historical data, specific impaired Contracts, economic conditions, and other risks inherent in the Contracts. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recovery.
In addition, specific allowances are established for accounts past due over 120 days. Individual contracts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual contracts appears doubtful. The collectability of outstanding and cancelled contracts is generally secured by collateral in the form of the unearned premiums on the underlying policies and accordingly historical losses are approximately 1% to 1.5% of the principal amount of loans made each year. The Company considers historical losses in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The collectability of amounts due from agents is determined by the financial strength of the agency.
