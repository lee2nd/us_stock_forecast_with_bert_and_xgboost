Overview
We have the largest regional airline operation in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately 1,770 total daily departures to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. The number of flights we operated during 2020 was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See Competition and Economic Conditions section for additional information regarding the COVID-19 impact on our operations on page 5. As of December 31, 2020, we had 601 total aircraft in our fleet, including 452 aircraft in scheduled service under our code-share agreements, summarized as follows:
*As of December 31, 2020, these aircraft have been removed from service and are in the process of being placed under a leasing arrangement with a third party, are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners and being used as supplemental spare aircraft, are available for future code-share agreements or are in the process of being parted out.
Our business model is based on providing scheduled regional airline service under code-share agreements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline’s flight designator codes on its flights) with our major airline partners. Our success is principally centered on our ability to meet the needs of our major airline partners through providing a reliable and safe operation at attractive economics. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact to our operations including a reduction in the number of flights we were scheduled to operate during 2020 and changes we made to enhance the safety of our passengers and employees, including aircraft cleaning procedures and use of personal protective equipment.
During the 2020 calendar year, we made several changes to our fleet count under our flying agreements, including the addition of 37 new E175 aircraft, and the removal of four CRJ900 aircraft, four CRJ700 aircraft and 60 CRJ200 aircraft. Additionally, during the 2020 calendar year, we increased the number of CRJ700 aircraft we leased to third parties from 10 aircraft to 34 aircraft. Leases on two CRJ200 aircraft with third parties terminated during 2020.
We anticipate our fleet will continue to evolve, as we are scheduled to add 20 new E175 aircraft with American, 25 used CRJ700 aircraft with American and one new CRJ900 aircraft with Delta by the end of 2022. Timing of these anticipated deliveries may be subject to change as we are coordinating with our major airline partners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on demand. Our primary objective in the fleet changes is to improve our profitability by adding new E175 aircraft to capacity purchase agreements, and potentially removing older aircraft from service that typically require more maintenance cost.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 47.1% of our aircraft in scheduled service were operated for United, approximately 31.4% were operated for Delta, approximately 14.4% were operated for American and approximately 7.1% were operated for Alaska.
Historically, multiple contractual relationships with major airlines have enabled us to reduce our reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of capacity purchase arrangements and our prorate flying arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, contract flying revenue and prorate revenue represented approximately 87.0% and 13.0%, respectively, of our total flying agreements revenue. On contract routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on completed block hours (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time), flight departures, the number of aircraft under contract and other operating measures. On prorate routes, we have more control over scheduling, pricing and seat inventories, we share passenger fares with our major airline partners according to prorate formulas and we are responsible for the operating costs of the prorate flights, including fuel and airport costs.
Our financial and operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 contained in this Report, include the financial results and position of ExpressJet through January 22, 2019 for those respective periods.
Financial Highlights
We had total operating revenues of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 28.4% decrease compared to total operating revenues of $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. We had a net loss of $8.5 million, or $0.17 loss per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income of $340.1 million, or $6.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The significant items affecting our revenue and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 are outlined below:
Revenue
The number of aircraft we have in scheduled service and the number of block hours we generate on our flights are primary drivers to our flying agreements revenue under our capacity purchase arrangements. The number of flights we operate and the corresponding number of passengers we carry are the primary drivers to our revenue under our prorate flying agreements. As a result of lower passenger demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of aircraft we operated decreased from 483 as of December 31, 2019 to 452 as of December 31, 2020; the number of block hours decreased from 1.5 million in 2019 to 1.0 in 2020, or by 33.5%; and the number of passengers we carried decreased from 43.7 million in 2019 to 21.3 in 2020, or by 51.3%.
As a result of reduced flight schedules and fewer aircraft operating under our capacity purchase agreements in 2020 compared to 2019, our capacity purchase revenue decreased $576.4 million, or 24.3% in 2020. Additionally, we deferred recognizing revenue on $110.7 million of fixed monthly payments received under our capacity purchase agreements during 2020 as a result of significant reductions to our flight schedules as further described in the section of this Report entitled “Results of Operations.” Also, as a result of a reduction in the number of aircraft operating under our prorate agreements and fewer passengers carried on our prorate routes, our prorate revenue decreased by $252.1 million, or 48.4% in 2020. The negative impact to our revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated effects on the travel industry is anticipated to continue in 2021 and may continue into subsequent periods.
Operating Expenses
Our total operating expenses decreased $441.4 million, or 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the number of flights we operated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Departures decreased from 842,098 in 2019 to 585,257 in 2020, or by 30.5%. Additionally, during 2020 we recorded $345.5 million in payroll support grants received from Treasury under the CARES Act as an offset to our operating expenses. Additional details regarding the decrease in our operating expenses are described in the section of this Report entitled “Results of Operations.”
Fleet Activity
The following table summarizes our fleet activity for 2020:
During 2020, we took delivery of 37 new E175 aircraft and placed the aircraft into service under capacity purchase agreements. We removed four CRJ900 aircraft from service, four (net) CRJ700 aircraft from service and 60 (net) CRJ200 aircraft from service. We are evaluating alternative uses for the four CRJ900 aircraft removed from service and we anticipate placing the four (net) CRJ700 aircraft into service with American in 2021. We returned 19 CRJ200s to the lessor and we anticipate storing the remaining 41 CRJ200s removed from service. We own the 41 CRJ200 aircraft removed from service and the aircraft are fully depreciated with no outstanding financial obligations.
Results of Operations
2020 Compared to 2019
Operational Statistics. The following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below. The decrease in block hours, departures and passengers carried during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due to the decrease in demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
NC = No Change
Operating Revenues
The following table summarizes our operating revenue for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
Flying agreements revenue primarily consists of revenue earned on flights we operate under our capacity purchase agreements and prorate agreements with our major airline partners. Lease, airport services and other revenues consist of revenue earned from leasing aircraft and spare engines to third parties separate from our capacity purchase agreements and providing airport counter, gate and ramp services.
We disaggregate our flying agreements revenue into the following categories (dollar amounts in thousands):
The decrease in “Capacity purchase agreements revenue: flight operations” of $593.1 million was due to a reduction in flights we were scheduled to operate by our major airline partners in 2020 as a result of decreased passenger demand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our completed departures decreased 30.5% and completed block hours decreased 33.5% during 2020 compared to 2019.
The increase in “Capacity purchase agreements revenue: aircraft lease and fixed revenue” of $16.7 million was due to the incremental lease revenue generated from six new E175 aircraft that we acquired through debt added to capacity purchase agreements and increases to the fixed monthly rates made to certain existing capacity purchase agreements that were extended since December 31, 2019. For clarity, we added a total of 37 new E175 to our capacity purchase agreements during 2020, however our major airline partners acquired 31 of these E175s and we have no aircraft ownership lease revenue associated with these 31 E175s.
The increase in “Capacity purchase agreements revenue: aircraft lease and fixed revenue” in 2020 compared to 2019 was partially offset by deferred revenue we recorded in 2020 attributed to the fixed cash payments per aircraft we received under our capacity purchase agreements compared to 2019. Under our capacity purchase agreements, we are paid a fixed amount per month per aircraft over the contract term. We recognize the fixed amount per aircraft as revenue proportionately to the number of flights we complete, our performance obligation, for each reporting period. We operated a materially lower number of flights during 2020 from previous levels due to a reduction in flight schedules resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We also anticipate the future number of flights we will complete over the remaining capacity purchase agreements will significantly increase from 2020 levels. Due to the materially reduced flight activity during 2020 from historical levels and based on anticipated increases in future monthly flight volumes over the remaining contract terms, we determined the fixed monthly cash payments per aircraft we received during 2020 was disproportionately high relative to the number of flights we operated during 2020. Accordingly, we deferred recognizing revenue of $110.7 million of fixed monthly cash payments we received under our capacity purchase agreements during 2020. Our deferred revenue related to the fixed payments will adjust over the remaining contract term for each capacity purchase agreement based on the number of flights we complete each reporting period relative to the number of flights we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term of each capacity purchase agreement. The deferred revenue balance applicable to each contract will be recorded as revenue by the end of each respective contract term.
The decrease in prorate agreements revenue of $252.1 million was due to the impact of COVID-19 and the corresponding decrease in passengers and passenger revenue we received on routes we operated under our prorate agreements during 2020 compared to 2019.
The decrease in lease, airport services and other revenues of $16.4 million was primarily due to the decrease in the number of flights operated at locations where we were contracted to provide airport customer service during 2020 compared to 2019.
Operating Expenses
Individual expense components attributable to our operations are set forth in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands).
NM = Not Measurable
Salaries, wages and benefits. The $175.6 million, or 17.5%, decrease in salaries, wages and benefits was due to a reduction in direct labor costs that resulted from a significantly lower number of flights we operated during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and reductions in overhead and other labor costs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated various cost saving measures, including a reduction in various administrative and support positions, temporarily placed a freeze on hiring new employees, temporarily suspended all non-scale pay increases and offered voluntary unpaid leave to our employees.
Aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs. The $104.7 million, or 20.4%, increase in aircraft maintenance expense was primarily due to an increase in direct maintenance costs incurred on a portion of SkyWest Airlines’ CRJ200 and CRJ700 fleet intended to extend the operational performance and reliability of these older aircraft, including increased engine maintenance expense during 2020 compared to 2019.
Depreciation and amortization. The $106.9 million, or 29.0%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a shortened estimated useful life of our owned CRJ200 fleet that resulted in approximately $74.5 million of incremental depreciation expense during 2020. During 2020, we removed 55 CRJ200 aircraft from a capacity purchase agreement with Delta, of which we returned 19 leased aircraft to the lessor and we own 36 aircraft. We also removed seven CRJ200 aircraft that we own from a prorate agreement with American. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were anticipating the agreement terms for these aircraft would have been extended beyond 2020. As we were unable to extend the flying contracts on these CRJ200s with our major airline partners and given the age of these aircraft, we shortened the estimated useful life on these aircraft to coincide with the agreement termination dates. Our depreciation also increased due to the acquisition of six new E175 aircraft and spare engines since December 31, 2019.
Airport-related expenses. Airport-related expenses include airport-related customer service costs such as outsourced airport gate and ramp agent services, airport security fees, passenger interruption costs, deicing, landing fees and station rents. For clarity, our employee airport customer service labor costs are reflected in salaries, wages and benefits and customer service labor costs we outsource to third parties are included in airport-related expenses. The $25.0 million, or 21.0%, decrease in airport-related expenses was primarily due to a decrease in airport service activities as a result of COVID-19 related flight schedule reductions.
Aircraft rentals. The $6.7 million, or 9.3%, decrease in aircraft rentals was primarily related to a reduction of our fleet size that was financed through leases from third parties as a result of scheduled lease expirations subsequent to December 31, 2019.
Aircraft fuel. The $57.4 million, or 48.2%, decrease in fuel cost was primarily due to a decrease in the number of flights we operated under our prorate agreements and corresponding decrease in gallons of fuel we purchased and a decrease in our average fuel cost per gallon from $2.51 in 2019 to $1.89 in 2020. We purchase and incur expense for all fuel on flights operated under our prorate agreements. All fuel costs incurred under our capacity purchase contracts are either purchased directly by our major airline partner, or if purchased by us, we record the direct reimbursement as a reduction to our fuel expense. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements, for the periods indicated:
CARES Act payroll support grant. In April 2020, we entered into an agreement with Treasury and received $450.7 million in emergency relief through the CARES Act payroll support program through 2020, of which $345.5 million was in the form of payroll support grants that are being recognized as a reduction in labor expense over the periods the grants are intended to compensate. We recognized $345.5 million in payroll support grant proceeds we received as a reduction to our operating expenses in 2020. We did not have a comparable payroll support grant in 2019.
Special Items. The $21.9 million special items expense for 2019 related to a non-cash write-off of $18.5 million in aircraft manufacturer part credits that we forfeited to settle future lease return obligations with the aircraft manufacturer. The $18.5 million of expense was included in the SkyWest Airlines segment. The special items expense also included $3.4 million of expense associated with a cash payout of certain ExpressJet employees’ stock equity grants as part of the sale of ExpressJet, which was reflected in the ExpressJet segment. We did not incur comparable special items expense in 2020.
Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses primarily consist of property taxes, hull and liability insurance, simulator costs, crew per diem, crew hotel costs and credit loss reserves. The $20.9 million, or 8.6%, decrease in other operating expenses was primarily related to a reduction in other operating costs that correspond to the significantly lower number of flights we operated during 2020 compared to 2019, such as crew per diem, crew hotel costs and simulator costs. These reductions were partially offset by an increase to our credit loss reserves of $30.8 million we recorded in 2020 following our adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“Topic 326”) on January 1, 2020. The increase to our credit loss reserves in 2020 was primarily due to a reserve we recorded on a note receivable that originated from our sale of ExpressJet in 2019 that became uncertain during 2020 due to ExpressJet ceasing operations in 2020. Our credit loss reserves also increased due to reductions in credit ratings during 2020 on certain entities for which we have outstanding accounts receivable or notes receivable.
Interest Expense. The $4.6 million, or 3.6%, decrease in interest expense related to an overall lower effective interest rate on our outstanding debt from 2019 to 2020. Our average debt balance, for the 2019 calendar year and the 2020 calendar year was $3.1 billion for both periods (using the average of the beginning and ending balances of each year).
Total airline expenses. Our total airline expenses, comprising of our total operating expenses and interest expense, decreased $446.0 million, or 17.2%, due to reduction in direct operating costs attributed to the reduced number of completed flights in 2020 compared to 2019 and due to the CARES Act payroll grant benefit we recorded in 2020. As our interest expense is primarily attributed to debt associated with financing aircraft under our capacity purchase agreements and as revenue earned under our capacity purchase agreements is intended to compensate us for our aircraft ownership costs, including interest expense, we believe our total airline expense is meaningful expense measure for management discussion and analysis purposes.
Summary of interest income, other income (expense) and provision for income taxes:
Interest income. Interest income decreased $8.3 million, or 58.4%, during 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease in interest income was primarily related to a decrease in average interest rates attributed to our marketable securities from 2019 to 2020.
Other income (expense), net. During 2020, we had other income, net of $1.2 million primarily related to income earned from our investment in a joint venture with a third party. During 2019, we had other income, net of $47.7 million primarily related to the gain on sale of ExpressJet.
Summary of provision for income taxes:
Provision for income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our income tax provision rates were 16.2% and 23.8%, respectively, which include the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and other reconciling income tax items, including state income taxes and the impact of non-deductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to pre-tax loss of $7.3 million and non-deductible expenses which resulted in a $1.2 million provision for income taxes. Our income tax provision rate may fluctuate each reporting period based on various factors including but not limited to, the amount of our non-deductible operating expenses, such as a portion of or crew per diem expenses, relative to our income before income taxes.
Net Income. Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net loss of $8.5 million, or $0.17 loss per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net income of $340.1 million, or $6.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our Business Segments 2020 compared to 2019:
Prior to our sale of ExpressJet on January 22, 2019, our reporting segments consisted of the operations of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, and the activities of SkyWest Leasing. We concluded the sale of ExpressJet did not meet the criteria for a discontinued operation. Following the sale of ExpressJet, our reporting segments include SkyWest Airlines and SkyWest Leasing.
Our chief operating decision maker analyzes the profitability of operating aircraft under our code-share agreements separately from the profitability of our financing new aircraft acquired through debt and cash placed under our capacity purchase agreements, currently consisting of our E175 fleet, and our return on such aircraft financing. More specifically, the SkyWest Leasing segment includes an allocation of revenue from our capacity purchase agreements attributed to our financing of new aircraft through debt and cash covered under such agreements (aircraft lease revenue), and the respective depreciation and interest expense of such financed aircraft. The SkyWest Leasing segment also includes the activity of acquiring and leasing used regional jet aircraft and regional aircraft engines to other entities. The SkyWest Leasing segment’s total assets and capital expenditures include new E175 aircraft acquired through the issuance of debt and our aircraft and engines leased to other entities.
The SkyWest Airlines segment includes all other revenue and operating expenses attributed to operating aircraft under our capacity purchase agreements and all revenue and operating expenses attributed to our prorate agreements and airport service agreements.
Corporate overhead expenses, primarily consisting of administrative labor costs, were allocated to the operating expenses of SkyWest Airlines, ExpressJet (prior to our sale of ExpressJet) and SkyWest Leasing. Overhead expenses allocated to SkyWest Leasing reflect our estimated labor expense incurred to support SkyWest Leasing activities.
The following table sets forth our segment data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
(1) Total Airline Expense includes operating expense and interest expense
SkyWest Airlines Segment Profit. SkyWest Airlines segment profit decreased $343.0 million, or 136.9%, during 2020, compared to 2019.
SkyWest Airlines block hour production decreased to 973,338, or 33.5%, for 2020 from 1,464,405 for 2019, primarily due to reduced flight schedules in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant items contributing to the SkyWest Airlines segment profit are set forth below.
SkyWest Airlines operating revenues decreased $841.9 million, or 34.0%, from 2019 to 2020 due to reduced flight schedules under our capacity purchase agreements, lower passenger demand and under our prorate agreements, and fewer flights we handled under our airport service agreements, collectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. SkyWest Airlines capacity purchase agreement revenue decreased $570.1 million from 2019 to 2020 due to the reduction in flight scheduled and block hours, which included deferred revenue of $110.7 million of payments received under our capacity purchase agreements during 2020. SkyWest Airlines prorate and other revenue decreased $271.8 million from 2019 to 2020 due to decreased passenger demand and reduced flight schedules.
SkyWest Airlines airline expense decreased $499.0 million, or 22.4%, from 2019 to 2020 due to the following primary factors:
● SkyWest Airlines’ salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased by $161.8 million, or 16.4%, primarily due to a reduction in direct labor costs that resulted from a significantly lower number of flights we operated during 2020 as a result the COVID-19 pandemic and reductions in overhead and other labor costs.
● SkyWest Airlines’ aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased by $107.7 million, or 21.6%, primarily due to an increase in direct maintenance costs incurred on a portion of SkyWest Airlines’ CRJ200 and CRJ700 fleet intended to extend the operational performance and reliability of these older aircraft, including increased engine maintenance expense during 2020 compared to 2019.
● SkyWest Airlines’ depreciation and amortization expense increased by $53.0 million, or 31.5%, primarily due to a shortened estimated useful life of our owned CRJ200 fleet that resulted in incremental depreciation expense during 2020.
● SkyWest Airlines’ fuel expense decreased $57.4 million, or 48.2%, due to a decrease in the number of flights we operated under our prorate agreements and a corresponding decrease in gallons of fuel we purchased and a decrease in our average fuel cost per gallon from $2.51 in 2019 to $1.89 in 2020.
● SkyWest Airlines’ recognized $345.5 million in payroll support grant proceeds we received through the CARES Act payroll support program as a reduction to our operating expenses in 2020. SkyWest Airlines did not have a comparable grant in 2019.
● SkyWest Airlines’ included special items related to a non-cash write-off of $18.5 million in aircraft manufacturer part credits that we forfeited to settle future lease return obligations with the aircraft manufacturer during 2019. SkyWest Airlines did not have a comparable special items expense in 2020.
● SkyWest Airlines’ remaining airline expenses decreased $76.4 million, or 17.4%, primarily related to a reduction in other operating costs that correspond to the significantly lower number of flights we operated during 2020 compared to 2019, such as crew per diem, crew hotel costs and simulator costs.
SkyWest Leasing Segment Profit. SkyWest Leasing profit decreased $60.6 million, or 43.7%, during 2020, compared to 2019, primarily related to credit loss reserves we recorded on a note receivable that originated from our sale of ExpressJet in 2019 that became uncertain during 2020 due to ExpressJet ceasing operations in 2020. Our credit loss reserves also increased due to reductions in credit ratings during 2020 on certain entities for which we have an outstanding accounts receivable or notes receivable. The reduction in the SkyWest Leasing segment was also due to additional depreciation expense resulting from a shortened estimated useful life of certain CRJ200 spare engines. These reductions were partially offset by an additional six new E175 aircraft added to our fleet subsequent to December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had $825.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $665.0 million available for borrowings under the Treasury Loan Agreement and $39.5 million available for borrowings under our line of credit. We have until May 28, 2021 to draw additional borrowings under the Treasury Loan Agreement. If we do not increase our borrowings under the Treasury Loan Agreement before May 28, 2021, our pledged collateral under the $725 million facility will be significantly reduced and any excess pledged collateral will be released and available to use for new debt, if needed. Given our available liquidity as of December 31, 2020 and given the measures we have implemented to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position and operations, we believe the working capital currently available to us (including funds from government assistance provided or may be provided pursuant to the CARES Act and the 2021 Appropriations Act) will be sufficient to meet our present financial requirements, including planned capital expenditures, scheduled lease payments, debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months.
Our total of cash and marketable securities increased from $520.2 million as December 31, 2019 to $825.9 million as of December 31, 2020, or by $305.7 million. Our total long-term debt, including current maturities increased from $2,993.1 million as of December 31, 2019 to $3,203.7 million as of December 31, 2020, or by $210.6 million. Thus, our total long-term debt, net of cash and marketable securities, decreased from $2,472.9 million as of December 31, 2019 to $2,377.8 million as of December 31, 2020, or $95.2 million. At December 31, 2020, our total capital mix was 43.3% equity and 56.7% long-term debt, compared to 45.3% equity and 54.7% long-term debt at December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $61.1 million and $61.7 million, respectively, in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions. We had no restricted cash as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Cash Position and Liquidity. The following table provides a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and our total cash and marketable securities position as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands). See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our sources and used of cash in 2019 compared to 2018.
Cash Flows provided by Operating Activities
Our cash flows provided by operating activities was $633.6 million in 2020, compared to $721.0 million in 2019. Our operating cash flows are typically impacted by various factors including our net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses and gains such as depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, and gains or losses on the disposal of assets; and timing of cash payments and cash receipts attributed to our various current asset and liability accounts, such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
The decrease in our cash flow from operations in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in our net income of $348.6 million, the difference between net income of $340.1 million in 2019 and a net loss of $8.5 million in 2020, partially offset by an increase in non-cash depreciation expense of $106.9 million in 2020 from 2019, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $103.6 million in 2020 from 2019, and due to timing cash payments and cash receipts related to our current assets and liabilities in 2020 compared to 2019.
Cash Flows used in Investing Activities
Our cash flows used in investing activities was $683.5 million in 2020, compared to $657.0 million in 2019. Our investing cash flows are typically impacted by various factors including our capital expenditures, including the acquisition aircraft and spare engines; deposit payments and receipts on new aircraft; purchase and sales of marketable securities; proceeds from the sale of assets; and timing of cash payments and cash receipts attributed to our various long-term asset and long-term liability accounts.
The increase in our cash flow used in investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales of marketable securities, of $105.2 million in 2020 from $72.0 million in 2019 and an increase in our long-term assets resulting from an increase in long-term receivables from our major airline partners under our capacity purchase agreements. We amended certain debt agreements on our aircraft which suspended our obligation to make debt service payments for an approximate a six-month period during 2020. Concurrently, we suspended required aircraft ownership payments due to us from our major airline partners under our capacity purchase agreements during the same period. We anticipate collecting these payments from our major airline partners over the remaining contract terms, which was the primary factor in the increase in our long-term other assets of $94.3 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
The increase in our cash flows used in investing activities was significantly offset by reduction in capital expenditures of $223.6 million in 2020 from $661.9 million in 2019. During 2020, we acquired six new E175 aircraft
and 22 used CRJ aircraft compared to ten new E175 aircraft and 85 used CRJ aircraft in 2019, including 56 used CRJ aircraft purchased under an early lease buyout in 2019.
Cash Flows provided by (used in) Financing Activities
Our cash flows provided by financing activities was $178.4 million in 2020, compared to cash used for financing activities of $305.2 million in 2019. Our investing cash flows are typically impacted by various factors including proceeds from issuance of debt, principal payments on debt obligations, repurchases our common stock and payment of cash dividends.
The $483.6 million increase in cash provided by financing activities included the additional proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt to Treasury of $105.2 million under the Payroll Support Program Agreement and $60.0 under the Treasury Loan Agreement during 2020. Additionally, we amended certain debt agreements on our aircraft which suspended our obligation to make debt service payments for an approximate a six-month period during 2020, which was the primary factor to our reduction in principal payments on long-term debt of $195.0 million from 2019 to 2020. See Significant Commitments and Obligations for our summary of principal maturities on our long-term debt for the next five years. We also reduced our cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, treasury stock and payment of dividends by $16.1 million, $52.3 million, and $10.4 million, respectively, due to restrictions under the Payroll Support Program Agreement and the Treasury Loan Agreement that began in April 2020.
Significant Commitments and Obligations
General
The following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):
(A) At December 31, 2020, all of our total long-term debt associated with aircraft had fixed interest rates.
Purchase Commitments and Options
We are coordinating with our major airline partners and aircraft manufacturers on the timing of upcoming fleet deliveries under previously announced deals in response to COVID-19 schedule reductions. The anticipated future aircraft delivery dates are subject to change. As of December 31, 2020, we had a firm purchase commitment for 20 E175 aircraft from Embraer with scheduled delivery dates anticipated through 2022.
At the time of each aircraft acquisition, we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us, and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition. In recent years, we have issued long-term debt to finance our new aircraft. At present, we intend to fund our aircraft purchase commitments through cash on hand and debt financing. Based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions, we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions, as well as additional aircraft. We intend to finance the firm purchase commitment for 20 E175 aircraft with approximately 80-85% debt and the remaining balance with cash.
Aircraft Lease and Facility Obligations
We also have significant long-term lease obligations, primarily relating to our aircraft fleet. Excluding aircraft financed by our major partners that we operate for them under contract, we had 41 aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from less than one to ten years as of December 31, 2020. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $359.7 million at December 31, 2020. Assuming a 6.1% discount rate, which is the average incremental borrowing rate we anticipate we would have incurred on debt obtained over a similar term to acquire these assets, the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately $288.6 million at December 31, 2020.
Long-term Debt Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.07 billion of long-term debt obligations related to the acquisition of aircraft and certain spare engines. The average effective interest rate on those long-term debt obligations was approximately 4.0% at December 31, 2020. We also had $165.2 million of long-term debt obligations under the Payroll Support Program Agreement and the Treasury Loan Agreement.
Under our capacity purchase arrangements, the major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning or leasing the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement, but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract.
Guarantees
We have guaranteed the obligations of SkyWest Airlines under the Delta Connection Agreement and the United Express Agreement for the E175 aircraft. In addition, we have guaranteed certain other obligations under aircraft financing and leasing agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management’s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, aircraft leases, long-lived assets, self-insurance and income tax as discussed below. The application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results will likely differ, and could differ materially, from such estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Flying agreements and airport customer service and other revenues are recognized when service is provided. Under our capacity purchase and prorate flying agreements with our major airline partners, our performance obligation is determined on a per completed flight basis. Under our capacity purchase agreements, the performance obligation of each completed flight is measured using block hours incurred for each completed flight, which factors the duration of each flight. Under our airport customer service agreements, our performance obligation is measured on per departure basis for each flight we provide customer service.
A portion of our compensation under our capacity purchase agreements is designed to reimburse us for the use of the aircraft we provide under such agreements. This compensation is deemed to be lease revenue, inasmuch as the agreements identify the “right of use” or a specific type and number of aircraft over the agreement term. The amount of compensation deemed to be lease revenue is determined from the agreed upon rates for the use of the aircraft included in each capacity purchase agreement, which we believe approximates fair value for the aircraft leases.
Additionally, under our capacity purchase agreements, we typically receive a fixed monthly payment for each aircraft under contract over the agreement term (“Fixed Monthly Payments”). We recognize revenue attributed to the Fixed Monthly Payments proportionate to the number of block hours complete during each reporting period, relative to the estimated number of block hours we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term. Due to the material decrease in completed block hours in 2020 from historical levels and from anticipated future levels over the remaining contract terms, we determined the amount of Fixed Monthly Payments we received in 2020 was disproportionately high
relative to the number of block hours we completed during 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we deferred recognizing revenue of $110.7 million in Fixed Monthly Payments we received during the 2020 calendar year. We deferred recognizing revenue of $69.1 million during the second quarter of 2020 when we generated 126,026 block hours, $29.6 million during the third quarter of 2020 when we generated 222,561 block hours and $12.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 when we generated 267,528 block hours. The amount of deferred revenue from Fixed Monthly Payments we recognize will increase or decrease in future reporting periods depending on the number of block hours we complete during such reporting period and our then-current forecast of block hours we anticipate completing over the remaining contract term based on information available to us as that time. We anticipate we will continue to defer recognizing revenue into 2021 and may begin recognizing previously deferred amounts as revenue by late 2021 or in 2022, depending upon future block hour production and flight schedules.
Our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors, such as our flight schedules, passenger fares we receive under our prorate agreements, terminations, extensions or other amendments to our code-share agreements, our estimates used to determine the amount of revenue we defer under our capacity purchase agreements, and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we record that period’s revenues based on the lower of the prior period’s approved rates or our estimate of rates that will be implemented upon completion of negotiations. Also, in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major airline partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and, provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute. Our rates were finalized under our code-share agreements as of December 31, 2020.
Aircraft Leases
As of December 31, 2020, our fleet of aircraft in scheduled service included 41 aircraft under lease, excluding 58 aircraft financed by our major partners that we operate for them under contract. In order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine the lease classification. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases. Under the majority of our operating leases, we are required to meet certain lease return conditions with the aircraft, which presumes a certain percent of the eligible flight time for certain components since the last overhaul remains when the aircraft is returned to the lessor. A liability for probable lease return costs is recorded after the aircraft has completed its last maintenance cycle prior to being returned. Several factors can impact the estimated liability for lease return costs including, but not limited to, timing of scheduled maintenance events and anticipated condition of the aircraft at the end of the lease term. We believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for lease return obligations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made.
Long-Lived Assets
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $5.4 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of certain of these assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. When considering whether or not impairment of long-lived assets exists, we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for each asset group to the net carrying amount of the assets supporting the asset group. Asset groupings are done at the fleet type or contract level. Factors that may impact our estimates used for depreciation include anticipated useful lives of each aircraft type and estimated residual values of each aircraft. As we operate all of our aircraft under code-share agreements with our major airline partners, changes in anticipated demand by our major airline partners for regional aircraft may impact our estimated useful lives and residual values for our aircraft, spare engines and other long-lived
assets. At December 31, 2020, we had 108 aircraft that were not in scheduled service with our partners, including 74 CRJ200s, 30 CRJ700s, and 4 CRJ900s. The CRJ200 aircraft that were removed from the Delta and American agreements were fully depreciated as of December 31, 2020. The remaining aircraft are in the process of being placed under a leasing arrangement with a third party, are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners and being used as supplemental spare aircraft or are available for future code-share agreements.
Self-Insurance
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liability of certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, product liability, property insurance and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with risks retained by us are not discounted and are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
Our workers’ compensation liability includes estimated outstanding losses of unpaid claims and allocated loss adjustment expenses (“ALAE”), which includes case reserves, the development of known claims and incurred but not reported claims. ALAE are the direct expenses for settling specific claims. The amounts reflect per occurrence and annual aggregate limits maintained by us. The estimated liability analysis does not include estimating a provision for unallocated loss adjustment expenses. We believe that the liability recorded at December 31, 2020 is adequate to cover all workers' compensation claims incurred through December 31, 2020. If the actual costs of such claims and related expenses exceed the amount estimated, additional reserves may be required which could have a material negative effect on our operating results. Holding other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in our estimated workers compensation liability as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in additional expense of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The liability related to our self-insured group medical insurance plans includes an estimate for claims incurred but not paid. This estimate is created using general actuarial principles and our historical claims experience. The cost of general liability, product liability and commercial auto liability is accrued based on estimates of the aggregate liability claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
Income Tax
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Estimating our tax liabilities involves judgments related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We make certain estimates and judgments to determine tax expense for financial statement purposes as we evaluate the effect of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, some of which result from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue or expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Changes to these estimates may result in significant changes to our tax provision in future periods. Each fiscal quarter we re-evaluate our tax provision and reconsider our estimates and assumptions related to specific tax assets and liabilities, making adjustments as circumstances change.
