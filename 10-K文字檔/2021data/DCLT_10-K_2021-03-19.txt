ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. Table of Contents
Results of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
We had $571,874 of sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to sales revenue of $629,097 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease in sales revenue of $57,223 or approximately a 9.10% decrease from the prior year. We generate revenues through subscription fees received in connection with our DL Manager and InfoServices. Many of our customers discontinued our service because of the pandemic. Many of our customers provide services to the general public.
We had total costs of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $197,703 compared to total costs of sales of $192,044 for the year ended December 31, 2019, or an increase of $5,659 or about 2.90% of which resulted in a gross margin of $374,171 for the year ended December 31, 2020 or 65.4%, compared to a gross margin of $437,053 or 69.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease in gross margin of $62,882 from the prior year, our decrease in gross margin was due a combination of our increase cost associated with our decreased revenue and the loss of economies of scale with the reduction of revenue.
Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 34.9 % for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 30.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. As we gain more customers and enter into more service agreements, we anticipate our cost of sales will decrease as we expect to take advantage of applicable economies of scale. Our operating expenses decreased to $394,186 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to operating expenses of $425,076 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease in expenses of $30,890 from the prior period. The decrease in expenses for the year of 2020 was due to the Company’s ongoing efforts to expand its operations in the most cost effective and efficient means while reducing costs and the cost of stock issued. We had a net loss of $22,454. The primary cause of the loss was that the trade show filed for bankruptcy in the 4th quarter which caused us in turn to write off approximately $20,000 in prepaid expenses. We have filed a claim with the court but at this time we do not feel that we will be able to recover any of our expenses. There can be no assurance regarding our operating results in 2021, but we believe that we will experience a significant reduction in non-cash expense as well as increased operating revenues which should result in profitable operations.
