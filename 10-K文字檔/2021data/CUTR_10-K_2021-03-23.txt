Executive Summary
Company Description
The Company is a leading medical device company specializing in the research, development, manufacture, marketing and servicing of light and other energy-based aesthetics systems for practitioners worldwide. In addition to internal development of products, the Company distributes third party sourced products under the Company’s own brand names. The Company offers easy-to-use products which enable practitioners to perform safe and effective aesthetic procedures, including treatment for body contouring, skin resurfacing and revitalization, tattoo removal, removal of benign pigmented lesions, vascular conditions, hair removal, toenail fungus and women's intimate health. The Company’s platforms are designed to be easily upgraded to add additional applications and hand pieces, which provide flexibility for the Company’s customers as they expand their practices. In addition to systems and upgrade revenue, the Company generates revenue from the sale of post warranty service contracts, providing services for products that are out of warranty, hand piece refills and other per procedure related revenue on select systems and distribution of third-party manufactured skincare products. The Company also expands its revenues from sales of third-party skincare products by utilizing its network and relationships with physicians and practitioners.
The Company’s ongoing research and development activities primarily focus on developing new products, as well as improving and enhancing the Company’s portfolio of existing products. The Company also explores ways to expand the Company’s product offerings through alternative arrangements with other companies, such as distribution arrangements. The Company introduced Juliet, a product for women’s intimate health, in December 2017, Secret RF, a fractional RF microneedling device for skin revitalization, in January 2018, enlighten SR in April 2018, truSculpt iD in July 2018, excel V+ in February 2019 truSculpt flex in June 2019, Secret PRO in July 2020 and excel V+III during the fourth quarter of 2020.
The Company’s corporate headquarters and U.S. operations are located in Brisbane, California, where the Company conducts manufacturing, warehousing, research and development, regulatory, sales and marketing, service, and administrative activities. The Company markets sells and services the Company’s products through direct sales and service employees in North America (including Canada), Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Sales and Services outside of these direct markets are made through a worldwide distributor network in over 42 countries.
Products and Services
The Company derives revenue from the sale of Products and Services. Product revenue includes revenue from the sale of systems, hand pieces and upgrade of systems (collectively “Systems” revenue), replacement hand pieces, truSculpt iD cycle refills, and truSculpt flex cycle refills, as well as single use disposable tips applicable to Juliet and Secret RF (“Consumables” revenue), the sale of third party manufactured skincare products (“Skincare” revenue); and the leasing of equipment through a membership program . A system consists of a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface, a laser and (or) other energy-based module, control system software and high voltage electronics, as well as one or more hand pieces. However, depending on the application, the laser or other energy-based module is sometimes contained in the hand piece such as with the Company’s Pearl and Pearl Fractional applications instead of within the console.
The Company offers customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost-effectively add applications to their system as their practice grows. This provides customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems whenever they choose and provides the Company with a source of additional Systems revenue. The Company’s primary system platforms include excel, enlighten, Juliet, Secret RF, truSculpt and xeo.
Skincare revenue relates to the distribution of ZO’s skincare products in Japan. The skincare products are purchased from a third-party manufacturer and sold to medical offices and licensed physicians. The Company acts as the principal in this arrangement, as the Company determines the price to charge customers for the skincare products and controls the products before they are transferred to the customer.
Service includes prepaid service contracts, enlighten installation, customer marketing support and labor on out-of-warranty products.
Significant Business Trends
The Company believes that the ability to grow revenue will be primarily impacted by the following:
● continuing to expand the Company’s product offerings, both through internal development and sourcing from other vendors;
●
ongoing investment in the Company’s global sales and marketing infrastructure;
●
use of clinical results to support new aesthetic products and applications;
● enhanced luminary development and reference selling efforts (to develop a location where Company’s products can be displayed and used to assist in selling efforts);
●
customer demand for the Company’s products;
●
consumer demand for the application of the Company’s products;
●
marketing to physicians in the core dermatology and plastic surgeon specialties, as well as outside those specialties; and
●
generating recurring revenue from the Company’s growing installed base of customers through the sale of system upgrades, services, hand piece refills, truSculpt cycles, skincare products and replacement tips for Juliet and Secret RF products.
For a detailed discussion of the significant business trends impacting the Company’s business, please see the section titled “Results of Operations” below.
Critical accounting policies, significant judgments and use of estimates
The preparation of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes requires the Company to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company has based its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company periodically reviews its estimates and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, its financial condition or results of operations will be affected.
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that its critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its audited consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other disclosures included in this report.
For an analysis of the Company’s Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates please refer to Note 1 “Summary of significant accounting policies” to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies, estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and may involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change:
Revenue Recognition
See "Part II, Item 8. Revenue Recognition, Note 1" to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Company’s revenue recognition policy, significant judgement and criteria for recognizing revenue.
The Company enters into contracts with multiple performance obligations where customers purchase a combination of systems and services. Determining whether systems and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment. The Company determines the transaction price for a contract based on the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as expected price adjustments for returns, the Company applies judgment when estimating variable consideration and when estimating the extent to which the transaction price is subject to the constraint on variable consideration. The Company evaluates constraints based on its historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts.
The Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each performance obligation.
The Company utilizes the observable standalone selling price when available, which represents the price charged for the performance obligation when sold separately. When standalone selling prices for systems or services are not directly observable, the Company determines the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and applies suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach.
The Company determines the standalone selling price (“SSP”), for systems based on directly observable sales in similar circumstances to similar customers. The SSPs for extended service contracts are based on observable prices when sold on a standalone basis.
Under the Company’s loyalty program, customers accumulate points based on their purchasing levels. Once a loyalty program member achieves a certain tier level, the member earns a reward such as the right to attend the Company’s advanced training event for truSculpt, or a ticket for the Company’s annual forum. A customer’s account must be in good standing to receive the benefits of the rewards program. Rewards are earned on a quarterly basis and must be used in the following quarter. All unused rewards are forfeited. The fair value of the reward earned by loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction of net revenue at the time the reward is earned.
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract, including sales commissions, are allocated to the distinct goods and services to which they relate based on the relative stand-alone selling prices. Incremental costs related to obligations delivered at inception are recognized at contract inception. Those related to obligations delivered over time are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected customer relationship period if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company uses the portfolio method to recognize the amortization expense related to these capitalized costs related to initial contracts and such expense is recognized over a period associated with the revenue of the related portfolio, which is generally two to three years for the Company’s product and service arrangements.
Valuation of Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. An impairment charge is recorded for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 1" in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
Capitalized Cloud Computing Costs
The Company capitalizes costs incurred related to implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to develop or obtain internal-use software in accordance with ASU No. 2018-15, "Intangibles (Topic 350): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract," which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The capitalized implementation costs are then amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement inclusive of expected contract renewals, which is generally three to five years. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 1" in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. The Company periodically assesses the capitalized implementation costs for impairment. If the Company determines that an impairment is necessary, the Company records an impairment loss.
Leases
Lessee
The Company is a party to certain operating and finance leases for vehicles, office space and storages. The Company’s material operating leases consist of office space, as well as storage facilities. The Company’s leases generally have remaining terms of 1 to 10 years, some of which include options to renew the leases for up to 5 years.
The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. Right of Use Assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease Right of Use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, the Company estimates the incremental secured borrowing rates corresponding to the maturities of the leases. The Company based the rate estimates on prevailing financial market conditions, credit analysis and management judgment.
The Company recognizes expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and reduce the Company’s right-of-use asset related to the lease. These are amortized through the right-of-use asset as reductions of expense over the lease term.
Lessor
Beginning in 2020, the Company also enters into leasing transactions, in which the Company is the lessor, offered through the Company's membership program. All of the Company's leases for equipment rentals were initially accounted for as operating leases. The lease agreements are typically for three years; however, the customer has the right to terminate the lease after twelve months with no penalty. As such, the Company has determined that the expected term of the lease is twelve-months. Rental charges are a fixed monthly fee, paid at the beginning of each month, over the term of the lease. Along with the leased equipment, the membership program provides customers with a warranty service and a fixed amount of consumables per month for the term of the lease, which are classified as non-lease components. The Company has made an accounting policy election to account for qualifying lease components and associated non-lease components as a single component; accordingly, a lease component and an associated warranty service non-lease component are combined and accounted for as an operating lease. The consumables do not qualify for the practical expedient and are accounted for as a separate non-lease component.
The initial direct costs related to the Company’s operating leases for equipment rentals include the related commissions paid to employees upon the origination of a lease agreement. These costs are included in Other current assets and prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the lease term of twelve-months.
During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, some of the membership program agreements were amended to grant the lessees an option to purchase the leased system from the Company, at any time during the period of 12 months from signing the amended agreement. For contracts signed under the amended membership agreement, the Company classified and accounted for the arrangement as sales-type leases, as the Company determined it is reasonably certain that the customer will exercise the purchase option.
At the commencement of the sales-type leases, the Company derecognized the underlying equipment and recognized a lease receivable if collectability criteria was met.
The Company adopted ASC Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, applying the modified retrospective method to all leases existing at the date of initial application. The comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, Notes 1 and 11" in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
Valuation of Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, cost being determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of the Company’s business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Standard costs are monitored and updated quarterly or as necessary, to reflect changes in raw material costs, labor to manufacture the product and overhead rates.
The cost basis of the Company’s inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excess or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company provides for excess and obsolete inventories when conditions indicate that the inventory cost is not recoverable due to physical deterioration, forecast usage, obsolescence, reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices. Inventory provisions are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and net realizable value to establish a lower cost basis for the inventories. The Company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology, timing of new product introductions and customer demand levels.
The Company includes demonstration units within inventories. Demonstration units are carried at cost and amortized over an estimated economic life of two years. Amortization expense related to demonstration units is recorded in Products cost of revenue or in the respective operating expense line based on which function and purpose for which the demonstration units are being used. Proceeds from the sale of demonstration units are recorded as revenue and all costs incurred to refurbish the systems prior to sale are charged to cost of revenue.
See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 1" in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
Stock-based Compensation Expense
The Company’s equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. The Company’s equity incentive plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, RSAs, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights, performance stock units, performance shares, and other stock or cash awards. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 6" in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for share-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees and non-employees be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the single-option approach to determine the fair value of options granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant. The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock and it has no intention to pay a dividend at this time; therefore, the Company assumes that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards. The Company determines the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant. As such, the Company uses different assumptions during the year if it grants options at different dates.
The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-option pricing model to determine the fair value of an award include the following:
Expected Term: The expected term represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding prior to being exercised. The Company determines expected term based on historical exercise patterns and its expectation of the time it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.
Expected Volatility: For the underlying stock price volatility of the Company’s stock, the Company estimates volatility solely based on the Company’s historical volatility of its stock price.
Forfeitures: The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Under ASC 718, the Company has made an accounting policy to estimate forfeitures at the time awards are granted and revises, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock option.
The Company grants RSUs to the Company’s directors, officers and management employees and non-employees. The fair value of RSUs is based on the stock price on the grant date using a single-award approach. The RSUs are subject to a service vesting condition and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Shares are issued on the vesting dates, net of applicable tax withholding requirements to be paid by the Company on behalf of the recipient. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, the Company records the obligation for withholding amounts to be paid by the Company as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
Performance stock units are granted to the Company’s officers and management employees and non-employees. PSU’s with operational measurement goals are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The final number of shares of common stock issuable at the end of the performance measurement period, subject to the recipient’s continued service through that date, is determined based on the expected degree of achievement of the performance goals. Stock-based compensation expense for PSUs is recognized based on the expected degree of achievement of the performance goals over the vesting period. On the vesting date of PSU awards, the Company issues fully paid up common stock, net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by the Company and records the obligation for withholding amounts as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
During 2020 and 2019, the Company’s Board granted to executive officers, senior management and certain employees PSUs that vest subject to the recipients’ continued service and to the achievement of certain operational goals for the Company’s 2020 and 2019 fiscal year which consist of the achievement of revenue targets for consumable products, revenue targets for international revenue, and certain operational milestones related to product performance and business management.
On April 1, 2020, the Company issued RSUs to settle bonuses owed to management under the 2019 Management Bonus Program. In the past, the Company paid these bonuses with cash on hand. However, due to the economic conditions resulting from COVID-19, fully vested shares were issued in lieu of cash. The Company issued 209,981 shares related to this bonus payment to management and recognized $2.6 million in stock-based compensation expense during fiscal year 2020. The Company also recorded an equivalent reduction in bonus expense as a result of the settlement of the bonus in shares.
For a significant majority of the Company’s awards, share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which ranges from one to four years depending on the award. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for the portion of the equity award that is expected to vest over the requisite service period and develops an estimate of the number of share-based awards which will ultimately vest, primarily based on historical experience within separate groups of employees and expectations regarding achievement of PSU goals for PSU awards. The forfeiture rates used in 2020 ranged from 0% to 20.8%. The estimated forfeiture rate is reassessed periodically throughout the requisite service period. Such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures. For the award types discussed above, if the employee or non-employee terminates employment prior to being vested in an award, then the award is forfeited.
Modifications of the terms of outstanding awards may result in significant increases or decreases in share-based compensation. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company’s Board modified RSUs awards granted to certain senior management that vest subject to the recipients’ continued service.
There were no significant modifications to the terms of outstanding options, and PSUs during 2020.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors granted its executive officers, senior management, and certain employees 98,580 PSUs. The PSUs granted in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 vest subject to the recipients continued service and to the achievement of specific optional and regulatory milestones.
On August 2, 2020, the Board awarded its new CFO, Rohan Seth, an option grant for 60,000 shares, which vests over 5 years, and a PSU award covering a target of 22,423 shares, which vests over 2.5 years and is subject to performance-based criteria relating to the achievement of certain goals with 40% based on achievement of Finance department goals and 60% based on the Company’s achievement of financial performance. The maximum number of shares that may vest under the award is 150% of the target number of shares of Common Stock subject to the award.
See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, Notes 1 and 6" in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
The Company is subject to taxes on earnings in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. For those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event that the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
The Company’s net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future, an adjustment to the Company’s deferred taxes would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period such determination was made.
The Company’s effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance, foreign operations, research and development tax credits, state taxes, and certain benefits realized related to stock option activity. The Company’s current effective tax rate does not assume U.S. taxes on undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries. These earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or U.S. state taxes, should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the U.S. The Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower in countries where the Company has lower statutory rates and being higher in countries where the Company has higher statutory rates, or by changes in tax laws, accounting principles, interpretations thereof, net operating loss carryback, research, and development tax credits, and due to changes in the valuation allowance applied to its U.S. deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company is subject to the examination of the Company’s income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of the Company’s provision for income taxes.
Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been provided thereon. Due to the Transition Tax and Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (“GILTI”) regimes as enacted by the 2017 Tax Act, those foreign earnings will not be subject to federal income taxes when actually distributed in the form of a dividend or otherwise. The Company, however, could still be subject to state income taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. The amounts of taxes which the Company could be subject to are not material to the accompanying financial statements.
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act changed several of the existing U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, increasing the amount of deductible interest, allowing companies to carry back certain Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) and increasing the amount of NOLs that corporations can use to offset income. Further, in December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. It clarified that gross income does not include any amount that would otherwise arise from the forgiveness of a PPP loan. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and related taxes payable.
The Company periodically assesses its exposures related to its global provision for income taxes and believe that it has appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made.
The Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. The Company records tax benefits for only those positions that it believes will more likely than not be sustained. For positions that the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will prevail, the Company records a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If the Company judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution or expiration occurs. The Company has included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet a long-term income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of $1,864 and $1,461 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 7. Income Taxes” in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
Litigation
The Company has been, and may in the future become, subject to a number of legal proceedings involving securities litigation, product liability, intellectual property, contractual disputes, trademark and copyright, and other matters. The Company records a liability and related charge to earnings in its consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s assessment is reevaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. If a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, variable interest or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was not involved in any unconsolidated transactions.
Recent Accounting Pronouncement
In addition to the impacts from new accounting pronouncements included above see Note 1 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Pronouncements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements adopted and not adopted.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data expressed as a percentage of net revenue.
Net Revenue
The following table sets forth selected consolidated revenue by major geographic area and product category with changes thereof.
Total Net Revenue
The Company’s revenue decreased by $34.0 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due to significant decline in sales in the North America market as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was partially offset by increase in sales of Skincare products.
Revenue by Geography
The Company’s U.S. revenue decreased by $45.0 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic.
