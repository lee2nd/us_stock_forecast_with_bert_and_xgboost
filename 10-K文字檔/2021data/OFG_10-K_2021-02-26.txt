ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Covid-19 Pandemic 2020
In the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Covid-19 a pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of Covid-19, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures are severely restricting global economic activity, disrupting global supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities and causing significant volatility and disruptions in financial markets. To address the economic impact in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law four economic stimulus packages to provide relief to businesses and individuals, including the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). Among other measures, the CARES Act provided $349 billion funding for the Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”), which provides loans to small businesses to keep their employees on payroll and make other eligible payments. The original funding for the PPP was fully allocated by mid-April 2020, with additional funding made available on April 24, 2020 under the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, a $900 billion coronavirus relief bill as part of a larger $1.4 trillion omnibus spending and appropriations bill. This bill clarifies certain aspects of the first round of PPP and reopens another round of PPP funding for the hardest hit businesses. It also extends until March 31, 2021 the opportunity for employers to seek tax credits for wages paid for Families First Coronavirus Response Act qualifying emergency paid sick leave or emergency paid Family and Medical Leave Act. The new Coronavirus Relief Act also impacts the real estate sector through new rounds of rental assistance and an extension of the federal eviction moratorium.
On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board provided additional funding sources for small and mid-sized businesses as well as for state and local governments as they work through cash flow stresses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board has taken other steps to provide fiscal and monetary stimuli, including reducing the federal funds rate and the interest rate on the Federal Reserve’s discount window, and implementing programs to promote liquidity in certain securities markets. The Federal Reserve Board, along with other federal banking regulators, has also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that are working with borrowers affected by Covid-19.
In March, the Puerto Rico and USVI governments shut down non-essential businesses and imposed stay-at-home and other restrictions. Puerto Rico-based claims for unemployment have risen considerably since March of 2020. The Puerto Rico and USVI stay-at-home directives excluded essential businesses, including banks, and Oriental remained open and fully operational as described below. Such directives significantly reduced economic activity in Puerto Rico and the USVI. These measures, however, enabled Puerto Rico to begin the easing of such restrictions on economic activity by the end of the second quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the third, with a noticeable rebound in the local economy.
In response to the pandemic, Oriental has implemented protocols and processes to help protect our employees and clients. These measures include:
 Enhancing workplace safety by providing protective gear, increased sanitation and enforcing social distancing.
 Operating our businesses from remote locations, leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities that include having approximately 50% of employees work from home, and other employees operating using pre-planned contingency strategies for critical site-based operations. These capabilities have allowed us to continue to service our clients. We will continue to manage the increased operational risk related to the execution of our business continuity plans in accordance with our Risk Framework and Operational Risk Management Program.
 Expanding health insurance and benefits for employees, including coverage of the Covid-19 tests and related telemedicine, opening insurance networks of laboratories, pharmacies and doctors to ease employee access, and providing safety kits to all employees for personal or family use.
 Providing uninterrupted and excellent levels of service, achieved through several channels, including, phone, digital, branch appointments, ATMs, interactive ATMs, and drive-thru tellers, while maintaining employee and customer safety and social distancing. Oriental was the first bank in Puerto Rico and the USVI to establish consumer and business relief programs accessible online to clients affected by Covid-19 and scheduling appointments at most branches through its webpage.
 Offering assistance to our commercial, consumer and small business clients affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, which included payment deferrals, waivers of certain fees, doubling the amount that can be withdrawn or transferred via online banking and mobile check deposit, elimination of adverse credit reports, participation in the CARES Act and Federal Reserve lending programs for businesses, including the SBA PPP, and continuing to provide access to the important financial services on which our clients rely.
 Launching a digital portal, to make it fast and easy for our commercial clients to apply for PPP loan forgiveness.
In connection with reviewing our financial condition in light of the pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, for potential impairment. Based upon our review as of December 31, 2020, no impairments have been recorded and there have been no significant changes in fair value hierarchy classifications. We have also elected to delay for two years the phase-in of the capital impact from our adoption of the new accounting standard on credit losses. For more information, see Regulatory Capital section in the MD&A.
On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies along with the National Credit Union Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the state financial regulators, issued an interagency statement revising a March 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic (the “Interagency Statement”). The Interagency Statement reconfirmed that efforts to work with borrowers where the loans are prudently underwritten, and not considered past due or carried on nonaccrual status, should not result in the loans automatically being considered modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) for accounting and financial reporting purposes, or for purposes of their respective risk-based capital rules, which would otherwise require financial institutions subject to the capital rules to hold more capital. The Interagency Statement also clarified the interaction between its previous guidance and Section 4013 of the CARES Act, which provides certain financial institutions with the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs for a limited period of time for loan modifications made to address the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Oriental granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals. The majority of Oriental’s Covid-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs as:
•
they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under Oriental’s regular loan modification assessments or the Interagency Statement guidance, or
•
Oriental has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under Section 4013 of the CARES Act.
To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, Oriental accounts for them as TDRs.
As of December 31, 2020, Oriental had processed Covid-19 payment deferrals for more than 47,000 retail customers for $2.2 billion dollars. For our commercial customers, we had processed relief on $642.6 million dollars in loans. Deferrals have decreased from 30% of total loans in the second quarter to 1% of total loans in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2020, Oriental had loans subject to Covid-19 payment deferrals as follows:
Mortgage loans in the payment deferral program above consist of FHA and VA insured mortgage loans. Most commercial loans represent well-capitalized customers in the hospitality industry. For payment deferral programs that have expired at December 31, 2020, only 3% or $15.9 million, in the auto loan portfolio, 7% or $107.8 million, in the mortgage loan portfolio, 1% or $7.4 million, in the commercial portfolio, and 1% or $1.1 million in the consumer portfolio, have deteriorated to non-performing status. In accordance with Oriental’s policies, all accrued interest receivable of these loans in non-performing status have been reversed.
Additionally, Oriental is a lender for the SBA PPP, a CARES Act program, and other SBA, Federal Reserve Board or United States Treasury programs that have been created in response to the pandemic and may be a lender for programs created in the future. These programs are new and their effects on the Company’s business are uncertain. Through December 31, 2020, Oriental had approved 5,074 PPP loans amounting to $297 million, impacting more than 50,000 employees.
The macro-economic environment for the later part of 2020 has benefited from reduced Covid-19 related government restrictions on economic activity, combined with growing liquidity from the federal stimulus programs Puerto Rico is receiving related to the recovery from hurricane Maria in 2017, the early 2020 earthquakes, and now the Covid-19 pandemic.
Although the macroeconomic outlook has improved towards the end of the year 2020, the future direct and indirect impact of Covid-19 on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remain highly uncertain. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, this macroeconomic environment may have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on how the risks related to the Covid-19 pandemic may adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this annual report.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The accounting and reporting policies followed by Oriental conform with GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. Oriental’s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with this section.
Critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions, which involve significant judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that involve a high degree of subjectivity. These estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates. The following MD&A section is a summary of what management considers Oriental’s critical accounting policies and estimates.
Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment
One of the most critical and complex accounting estimates is associated with the determination of the allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses charged to current operations is based on this determination. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Oriental adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326), as of January 1, 2020. The total allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, which includes loans evaluated on a collective basis, was calculated using this approach.
For a detailed description of the principal factors used to determine the allowance for credit losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment and for the principal enhancement’s management made to its methodology, refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
Oriental’s management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis following a systematic methodology in order to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. In developing its assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, Oriental must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries or markets. Other factors that can affect management’s estimates are the key drivers used for each macroeconomic scenario, the macroeconomic scenarios selected, and the weighting given to each scenario, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses. Consequently, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations
could also be affected.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Oriental had another quarter of strong performance in our core businesses, reflecting our larger scale, solid levels of new loan production, lower cost of funds, higher non-interest income, and reduced expenses.
On a macro-basis, Oriental is benefitting from the improved economic environment in Puerto Rico and the USVI due to the continuing nascent rebound from the easing of Covid-19 restrictions and from pandemic-related stimulus.
Within this environment, Oriental’s success continues to be driven by resiliency, agility, and being more than ready to help customers and communities with their changing product and service needs. During the fourth quarter, Oriental also completed the integration of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and related cost-savings. We look forward to realizing the full benefits of our larger scale over the course of 2021. The vaccine inoculations should reduce the threat of Covid-19, and the Puerto Rico and USVI economies should expand from expected federal reconstruction and stimulus payments.
2020 was another challenging year for Puerto Rico, the USVI and Oriental. As in years past, we successfully worked our way through it. Our team members helped customers by swiftly processing loan deferrals; implementing an easy-to-use, fully online PPP application process; managing the rapid influx of deposits; and providing contactless and in-person services in a Covid-safe manner; implementing the Scotiabank integration in the middle of a pandemic.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following tables show major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, their respective interest income, expenses, yields and costs, and their impact on net interest income due to changes in volume and rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Comparative 2019 to 2018 information has been omitted pursuant to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K. For such comparative information, please see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Oriental’s 2019 annual report on Form 10-K.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is a function of the difference between rates earned on Oriental’s interest-earning assets and rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities (interest rate spread) and the relative amounts of its interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (interest rate margin). Oriental constantly monitors the composition and re-pricing of its assets and liabilities to maintain its net interest income at adequate levels.
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net interest income of $408.4 million increased $85.6 million from $322.8 million. Interest rate spread decreased 75 basis points to 4.51% from 5.26% and net interest margin decreased 82 basis points to 4.55% from 5.37%. These decreases are mainly due to the net effect of a decrease of 94 basis points in the average yield of total interest-earning assets and a decrease of 19 basis points in the total average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
Net interest income increased as a result of:
 Higher interest income from loans by $117.6 million, reflecting higher balances as a result of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and PPP loan originations, partially offset by a 75 basis points decline in yield from higher proportion of 30-year, fixed rate residential mortgages from such acquisition and the effect of Federal Reserve Board’s rate cuts on variable rate commercial loans;
 $6.5 million in one-time interest recoveries from acquired purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) Scotiabank loans; and
 Lower interest expenses in borrowings by $6.9 million, reflecting the maturity and early extinguishment of repurchase agreements during 2020.
Such increases in net interest income were adversely impacted by:
 Lower interest income from interest bearing cash and investment securities by $18.0 million, mainly impacted by the Reserve Board’s rate cuts; and
 Higher interest expense from deposits by $20.8 million, mainly related to deposits from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and to the increase in customer deposits during the current year, reflecting commercial deposits from existing and new clients, and retail deposits from increased liquidity in the economy.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income is affected by the amount of the Bank’s trust department assets under management, transactions generated by clients’ financial assets serviced by Oriental’s the securities broker-dealer and insurance agency subsidiaries, the level of mortgage banking activities, fees generated from loans and deposit accounts, and gains on sales of assets.
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Oriental recorded non-interest income, net, in the amount of $124.4 million, compared to $82.5 million, an increase of 50.7%, or $41.9 million. The increase in non-interest income was mainly due to:
 An increase of $19.7 million in banking service revenues reflecting the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition as electronic banking revenues and deposit fees increased $15.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively, due to Oriental’s larger customer base;
 An increase of $5.6 million in wealth management revenue due to higher insurance income by $6.8 million, mainly from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition insurance transaction volume, offset by lower trust fees and broker-dealer sales which declined by $476 thousand and $420 thousand, respectively;
 An increase of $12.2 million in mortgage-banking activities, also reflecting the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition, as servicing revenues increased by $8.3 million, and to an increase of $3.9 million from gains of loans sold; and
 A $7.3 million bargain purchase gain from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition to adjust the fair value of accrued interest receivable and deferred tax asset from new information obtained during 2020 about facts that existed as of December 31, 2019.
The increase in non-interest income was offset by a gain of $8.3 million on the sales of securities recorded in 2019 compared to a gain of $4.7 million recorded in 2020.
Non-Interest Expenses
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Non-interest expense was $345.3 million, representing an increase of 48.0%, or $112.0 million, compared to $233.2 million.
The increase in non-interest expenses was driven by:
 Higher compensation and employee benefits by $50.4 million, reflecting higher employee count from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition;
 Increase in occupancy and equipment by $17.2 million driven by a $10.9 million increase in facilities, including branches and main offices, from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and to $4.2 million increase in depreciation expenses also from the premises and equipment acquired;
 Increase in electronic banking charges by $13.5 million driven by a $8.5 million increase in debit card billing fees and a $4.1 million increase in credit card merchant fees, as level of transactions increased due to a larger customer base;
 Increase in information technology expenses by $11.0 million related to the Scotiabank’s system integrations;
 Increase in insurance expenses by $8.1 million, $5.9 million related to the FDIC annual assessment as a result of the increase in customer deposits;
 Pandemic expenses of $5.8 million incurred during the current year as a result of Covid-19, represented expenses incurred within our premises, such as acrylic shields, face shields and masks, and cleaning and disinfecting costs, in order to control pandemic spread and keep customers and employees safe, and also included employee Covid-19 testing;
 Increase in municipal tax and property tax by $5.1 million, from the Scotiabank acquired business and branches; and
 Other expenses increased by $5.6 million related to broker-dealer claims and settlement reserve, which increased by $2.5 million, and amortization of intangibles, which increased by $1.9 million as a result of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition. In addition, during the prior year, Oriental received a $1.0 million credit from the government of Puerto Rico as a result of an employee retention benefit for employers affected by Hurricane Maria in 2017, reducing other expenses in prior year.
The efficiency ratio was 66.49%, up from 58.88%, mainly as a result of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition. The efficiency ratio measures how much of Oriental’s revenues is used to pay operating expenses. Oriental computes its efficiency ratio by dividing non-interest expenses by the sum of its net interest income and non-interest income, but excluding gains on the sale of investment securities, derivatives gains or losses, other gains and losses, and other income that may be considered volatile in nature. Management believes that the exclusion of those items permits consistent comparability. Amounts presented as part of non-interest income that are excluded from the efficiency ratio computation for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $13.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively.
Provision for Credit Losses
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Based on an analysis of the credit quality and the composition of Oriental’s loan portfolio, management determined that the provision for the years was adequate to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to provide for expected credit losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks.
Provision for credit losses decreased $4.1 million from $96.8 million to $92.7 million. On January 1, 2020, Oriental implemented the Current Expected Credit Losses accounting standard (“CECL”) using the modified retrospective approach, which utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired as compared to prior approach based on incurred losses. The 2020 provision included a $39.9 million provision to incorporate changes in the macro-economic scenario and qualitative adjustments as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the 2019 additional $54.3 million provision placed to cover the sale of non-performing loans.
Income Taxes
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Oriental’s effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2020 compared to 28.5% in 2019. The decrease is based on capital gains from the mortgage-backed securities sales at lower rates in 2020 and the bargain purchase gain from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition.
Business Segments
Oriental segregates its businesses into the following major reportable segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury. Management established the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. Other factors such as Oriental’s organization, nature of its products, distribution channels and economic characteristics of its services were also considered in the determination of the reportable segments. Oriental measures the performance of these reportable segments based on pre-established goals of different financial parameters such as net income, net interest income, loan production, and fees generated. Oriental’s methodology for allocating non-interest expenses among segments is based on several factors such as revenue, employee headcount, occupied space, dedicated services or time, among others. Following are the results of operations and the selected financial information by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Banking
Oriental's banking segment net income before taxes increased $38.8 million from $42.9 million to an $81.7 million, mainly reflecting:
 Higher interest income from loans by $117.6 million, reflecting higher balances as a result of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and PPP loan originations, partially offset by a 75 basis points decline in yield from higher proportion of 30-year, fixed rate residential mortgages from the Scotiabank acquisition and the effect of Federal Reserve Board’s rate cuts on variable rate commercial loans;
 $6.5 million in one-time interest recoveries from acquired PCI Scotiabank loans;
 Higher interest expense from deposits by $21.8 million, mainly related to deposits from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and to the increase in customer deposits during the current year, reflecting commercial deposits from existing and new clients, and retail deposits from increased liquidity in the economy;
 An increase of $19.7 million in banking service revenues reflecting the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition as electronic banking revenues and deposit fees increased $15.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively, due to Oriental’s larger customer base;
 An increase of $12.2 million in mortgage-banking activities, also reflecting the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition, as servicing revenues increased by $8.3 million, and an increase of $3.9 million from gains of loans sold;
 A $7.3 million bargain purchase gain from the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition to adjust the fair value of accrued interest receivable and deferred tax asset from new information obtained during 2020 about facts that existed as of December 31, 2019; and
 An increase in non-interest expense by $109.2 million reflecting the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition, mainly in compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, electronic banking charges, information technology, insurance, and municipal and property taxes, in addition to the Covid-19 pandemic related expenses.
Wealth Management
Wealth management segment revenue consists of commissions and fees from fiduciary activities, and securities brokerage and insurance activities. Net income before taxes from this segment increased $1.8 million as a result of higher income and expenses due the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition, which included an insurance subsidiary.
Treasury
Treasury segment net income before taxes decreased by $21.0 million, mainly reflecting:
 Lower interest income from interest bearing cash and investment securities by $18.0 million, mainly impacted by the Federal Reserve Board’s rate cuts;
 Lower interest expenses in borrowings by $6.9 million, reflecting the maturity and early extinguishment of repurchase agreements during 2020; and
 A gain of $8.3 million on the sales of securities recorded in 2019 compared to a gain of $4.7 million recorded in 2020.
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
Assets Owned
At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s total assets amounted to $9.826 billion representing an increase of 5.7%, when compared to $9.298 billion at December 31, 2019. The loans and investment portfolios decreased by $140.6 million and $629.1 million, respectively, while cash and due from banks increased $1.298 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion increased by $1.3 billion primarily because of the influx of both commercial and retail deposits from increased liquidity in the economy as a result of government stimulus programs.
In 2020, Oriental sold $316.3 million mortgage-backed securities at a gain of $4.7 million and had $306.6 million in maturities of US Treasury notes that were not renewed.
Oriental’s loan portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans, commercial loans collateralized by mortgages on real estate, other commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans, and auto loans. At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s loan portfolio decreased by 2.12%, reflecting repayments and the 39.2 million increase in allowance for credit losses on Non-PCD loans as a result of CECL implementation and the $39.1 million provision to incorporate changes in the macro-economic scenario and qualitative adjustments as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Loan production in 2020 reached $1.730 billion, compared to $1.299 billion in 2019, driven by mortgage and commercial lending, including $296.7 million PPP loan originations. The Non-PCD loan portfolio, excluding allowance for credit losses, increased by $154.7 million from $4.735 billion at December 31, 2019 to $4.890 billion at December 31, 2020.
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Oriental offered several deferral programs for the payment of principal and interest for auto, personal, credit card, mortgage, and commercial loans for customers whose payments were not over 89 days past due at March 12, 2020 and that requested to be included in these programs. This contributed to the increase in accrued interest receivable during 2020 by $35.6 million.
Financial Assets Managed
Oriental’s financial assets include those managed by Oriental’s trust division, retirement plan administration subsidiary, and assets gathered by its broker-dealer and insurance subsidiaries. Oriental’s trust division offers various types of individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) and manages 401(k) and Keogh retirement plans and custodian and corporate trust accounts, while the retirement plan administration subsidiary manages private retirement plans. At December 31, 2020, the total assets managed by Oriental’s trust division and retirement plan administration subsidiary amounted to $3.476 billion, compared to $3.137 billion at December 31, 2019. Oriental’s broker-dealer subsidiary offers a wide array of investment alternatives to its client base, such as tax-advantaged fixed
income securities, mutual funds, stocks, bonds and money management wrap-fee programs. At December 31, 2020, total assets gathered by the broker-dealer and insurance agency subsidiaries from their customers’ investment accounts amounted to $2.474 billion, compared to $2.376 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly due to increased liquidity and improvement in the local economy as a result of government incentives in light of Covid-19 pandemic.
Goodwill
Oriental’s goodwill is not amortized to expense but is tested at least annually for impairment. A quantitative annual impairment test is not required if, based on a qualitative analysis, Oriental determines that the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired. Oriental completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31 of each year. Oriental tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities, as necessary, to defined reporting units. A fair value is then determined for each reporting unit. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values, no write-down of the recorded goodwill is necessary.
In connection with reviewing our financial condition given the pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, for potential impairment. Based upon our review as of December 31, 2020, no impairments have been recorded.
As of December 31, 2020, Oriental had $86.1 million of goodwill allocated as follows: $84.1 million to the banking segment and $2.0 million to the wealth management segment. Please refer to Note 12 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information on the annual goodwill impairment test.
Oriental’s loan portfolio is composed of mortgage, commercial, consumer, and auto loans business products. As shown in Table 5 above, total loans, net, amounted to $6.501 billion at December 31, 2020 and $6.642 billion at December 31, 2019. Oriental’s loans held-for-investment portfolio composition and trends were as follows:
 Commercial loan portfolio amounted to $2.402 billion (36.1% of the gross loan portfolio) compared to $2.222 billion (33.0% of the gross loan portfolio) at December 31, 2019. Commercial production, including the U.S. loan program production and PPP loans, increased 79.1% to $930.8 million in 2020 from $406.8 million in 2019.
 Mortgage loan portfolio amounted to $2.283 billion (34.3% of the gross loan portfolio) compared to $2.489 billion (36.8% of the gross originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2019. Mortgage loan production totaled $246.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which represents an increase of 165.2% from $92.8 million in 2019. Mortgage loans included delinquent loans in the GNMA buy-back option program amounting to $56.2 million and $75.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Servicers of loans underlying GNMA mortgage-backed securities must report as their own assets the defaulted loans that they have the option (but not the obligation) to repurchase, even when they elect not to exercise that option.
 Consumer loan portfolio amounted to $414.9 million (6.2% of the gross loan portfolio) compared to $504.5 million (7.5% of the gross loan portfolio) at December 31, 2019. Consumer loan production decreased 42.4% to $103.0 million in 2020 from $178.7 million in 2019.
 Auto and leasing portfolio amounted to $1.562 billion (23.4% of the gross loan portfolio) compared to $1.523 billion (22.6% of the gross originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2019. Auto production decreased 11.4% to $450.1 million in 2020 compared to $508.2 million in 2019.
At December 31, 2020, Oriental has $99.1 million of direct credit exposure to the Puerto Rico government, a $34.9 million decrease from December 31, 2019.
Credit Risk Management
Allowance for Credit Losses
Oriental maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level that management considers adequate to provide for probable losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks. Oriental’s allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) policy provides for a detailed quarterly analysis of expected credit losses.
On January 1, 2020, Oriental adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best estimate of future expected credit losses inherent in the Company’s relevant financial assets. This change in methodology represents a significant change from prior impairment method. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, Oriental recorded a net increase of $89.7 million in the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020 which was comprised of a net increase of $39.2 million allowance for credit losses for Non-PCD loans decreasing retained earnings and $50.5 million for PCD loans, made through the allowance and loan balances with no impact in capital. We adopted CECL using the modified retrospective method, therefore periods after January 1, 2020 are presented in accordance with ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable standards and the accounting policies described under Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements. Prior period amounts in the following tables that are referred to as Non-PCD loans correspond to loans, excluding loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, while the ones referred to as PCD loans correspond to loans accounted for under ASC 310-30.
The allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 also included $39.9 million due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of Covid-19 pandemic.
Tables 8 through 10 set forth an analysis of activity in the allowance for credit losses and present selected credit loss statistics for December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition, Table 5 sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio.
Please refer to the “Provision for Credit Losses” section in the MD&A for a more detailed analysis of provisions for credit losses.
Non-performing Assets
Oriental’s non-performing assets include non-performing loans and foreclosed real estate (see Tables 11 and 12). At December 31, 2020, Oriental had $147.9 million of non-accrual loans, including $37.5 million PCD loans accounted for under ASU 2016-13. At December 31, 2019, Oriental had $80.9 million of non-accrual loans.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, loans whose terms have been extended and which are classified as troubled-debt restructurings that are not included in non-performing assets amounted to $109.2 million and $103.7 million, respectively.
Delinquent residential mortgage loans insured or guaranteed under applicable FHA and VA programs are classified as non-performing loans when they become 90 days or more past due, but are not placed in non-accrual status until they become 12 months or more past due, since they are insured loans. Therefore, these loans are included as non-performing loans but excluded from non-accrual loans.
At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s non-performing assets increased by 39.5% to $165.6 million (1.69% of total assets), including $37.5 million PCD loans, mainly as a result of the new CECL methodology, from $118.7 million (1.28% of total assets) at December 31, 2019. Foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets amounting to $11.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020, decreased from $29.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019, recorded at fair value. Oriental does not expect non-performing loans to result in significantly higher losses. At December 31, 2020, the allowance coverage ratio to non-performing loans was 134.6% (99.5% at December 31, 2019).
Upon adoption of CECL, Oriental elected to maintain pools of loans that were previously accounted for under ASC 310-30 and will continue to account for these pools as a unit of account. As such, for PCD loans the determination of nonaccrual or accrual status is made at the pool level, not the individual loan level. Upon adoption of CECL, the allowance for credit losses was determined for each pool and added to the pool’s carrying amount to establish a new amortized cost basis. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the pool and the new amortized cost basis is the non-credit premium or discount which will be amortized interest income over the remaining life of the pool. On a quarterly basis, management will monitor the composition and behavior of the pools to assess the ability for cash flow estimation and timing. If based on the analysis performed, the pool is classified as non-accrual the accretion/amortization of the non-credit (discount) premium will cease.
Oriental follows a conservative residential mortgage lending policy, with more than 90% of its residential mortgage portfolio consisting of fixed-rate, fully amortizing, fully documented loans that do not have the level of risk associated with subprime loans offered by certain major U.S. mortgage loan originators. Furthermore, Oriental has never been active in negative amortization loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans, including those with teaser rates.
The following items comprise non-performing loans held for investment, Non-PCD and PCDs:
Commercial loans -At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s non-performing commercial loans amounted to $83.4 million (54.8 % of Oriental’s non-performing loans), a 94.8% increase from $42.8 million at December 31, 2019 (50.1% of Oriental’s non-performing loans). The increase was mainly due to PCD loan pools in nonaccrual amounting to $32.4 million. Non-PCD commercial loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due and are written-down, if necessary, based on the specific evaluation of the underlying collateral, if any.
Residential mortgage loans -At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s non-performing mortgage loans totaled $43.0 million (28.3% of Oriental’s non-performing loans), a 90.7% increase from $22.6 million (26.4% of Oriental’s non-performing loans) at December 31, 2019. Non-PCD residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due and are written-down, if necessary, based on the specific evaluation of the collateral underlying the loan, except for FHA and VA insured mortgage loans which are placed in non-accrual when they become 12 months or more past due.
Consumer loans -At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s non-performing consumer loans amounted to $5.0 million (3.3% of Oriental’s non-performing loans), a 13.8% decrease from $5.8 million at December 31, 2019 (6.8% of Oriental’s non-performing loans). Non-PCD consumer loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due and written-off when payments are delinquent 120 days in personal loans and 180 days in credit cards and personal lines of credit.
Auto loans and leases -At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s non-performing auto loans and leases amounted to $20.8 million (13.6% of Oriental’s total non-performing loans), an increase of 45.3% from $14.3 million at December 31, 2019 (16.7% of Oriental’s total non-performing loans). Non-PCD auto loans and leases are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, partially written-off to collateral value when payments are delinquent 120 days, and fully written-off when payments are delinquent 180 days.
Please refer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K for detailed information for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Oriental has two mortgage loan modification programs. These are the Loss Mitigation Program and the Non-Conforming Mortgage Loan Program. Both programs are intended to help responsible homeowners to remain in their homes and avoid foreclosure, while also reducing Oriental’s losses on non-performing mortgage loans.
The Loss Mitigation Program helps mortgage borrowers who are or will become financially unable to meet the current or scheduled mortgage payments. Loans that qualify under this program are those guaranteed by FHA, VA, RURAL, PRHFA, conventional loans guaranteed by Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC), conventional loans sold to FNMA and FHLMC, and conventional loans retained by Oriental. The program offers diversified alternatives such as regular or reduced payment plans, payment moratorium, mortgage loan modification, partial claims (only FHA), short sale, and deed in lieu of foreclosure.
The Non-Conforming Mortgage Loan Program is for non-conforming mortgages, including balloon payment, interest only/interest first, variable interest rate, adjustable interest rate and other qualified loans. Non-conforming mortgage loan portfolios are segregated into the following categories: performing loans that meet secondary market requirement and are refinanced under the credit underwriting guidelines of FHA/VA/FNMA/ FHLMC, and performing loans not meeting secondary market guidelines processed pursuant Oriental’s current credit and underwriting guidelines. Oriental achieved an affordable and sustainable monthly payment by taking specific, sequential, and necessary steps such as reducing the interest rate, extending the loan term, capitalizing arrearages, deferring the payment of principal or, if the borrower qualifies, refinancing the loan.
In order to apply for any of our loan modification programs, if the borrower is active in Chapter 13 bankruptcy, it must request an authorization from the bankruptcy trustee to allow for the loan modification. Borrowers with discharged Chapter 7 bankruptcies may also apply. Loans in these programs are evaluated by designated underwriters for troubled-debt restructuring classification if Oriental grants a concession for legal or economic reasons due to the debtor’s financial difficulties.
Liabilities and Funding Sources
As shown in Table 13 above, at December 31, 2020, Oriental’s total liabilities were $8.740 billion, 5.9% more than the $8.252 billion reported at December 31, 2019. Deposits and borrowings, Oriental’s funding sources, amounted to $8.518 billion at December 31, 2020 versus $8.004 billion at December 31, 2019, a 6.4% increase, mainly from higher core deposits by $911.4 million, while brokered deposits and borrowings decreased by $194.4 million and $203.2 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, deposits represented 99% and borrowings represented 1% of interest-bearing liabilities. At December 31, 2020, deposits, the largest category of Oriental’s interest-bearing liabilities, were $8.416 billion, an increase of 9.3% from $7.699 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting higher commercial deposits from existing and new clients and higher retail deposits as a result of increased liquidity in the economy.
Borrowings consist mainly of FHLB-NY advances and subordinated capital notes. The overall declines in brokered deposits and borrowings are part of the strategy to replace higher cost funding with lower cost core deposits.
Stockholders’ Equity
At December 31, 2020, Oriental’s total stockholders’ equity was $1.086 billion, a 3.9% increase when compared to $1.045 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase in stockholders’ equity reflects increases in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $12.0 million, in legal surplus of $7.5 million, in retained earnings of $20.5 million, in treasury stock of $610 thousand and in additional paid-in capital of $1.1 million. Book value per share was $19.54 at December 31, 2020 compared to $18.75 at December 31, 2019.
From December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, tangible common equity to tangible total assets increased from 8.96% to 9.00%, leverage capital ratio increased from 9.24% to 10.30%, common equity tier 1 capital ratio increased from 10.91% to 13.08%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased from 12.64% to 14.78%, and total risk-based capital ratio increased from 13.91% to 16.04%.
Regulatory Capital
Oriental and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to Oriental and the Bank (“Basel III capital rules”), which have been effective since January 1, 2015, are based on the final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. As of December 31, 2020, the capital ratios of Oriental and the Bank continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being “well-capitalized” under the Basel III capital rules.
On January 1, 2020, the Company implemented CECL using the modified retrospective approach. As a result, a $39.2 million allowance for credit losses was recorded for Non-PCD loans and $0.2 million for unused commitments with the corresponding adjustment reducing retained earnings, net of a $13.9 million deferred tax effect. For more information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On March 27, 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule that the Company adopted to delay for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). During the two-year delay, Oriental will add back to common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital 100% of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25% of the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). After two years, starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of CET1 capital over a three-year period.
In July 2019, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule, pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996, that simplifies for non-advanced approaches banking organizations the regulatory capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”) and certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences (temporary difference DTAs). It increases CET1 capital threshold deductions from 10% to 25% and removes the aggregate 15% CET1 threshold deduction. However, it retains the 250% risk weight applicable to non-deducted amounts of MSAs and temporary difference DTAs. On January 1, 2020, the Company elected to early implement the simplifications to the capital rule.
On November 13, 2019, the agencies jointly issued a final rule to simplify regulatory capital requirements for qualifying community banking organizations, as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Under the final rule, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and
meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio (equal to tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets) of greater than 9 percent, will be eligible to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework (qualifying community banking organizations). Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ capital rules be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The final rule was effective on January 1, 2020. Even though Oriental qualified for this ratio, the Company elected to opt-out.
The risk-based capital ratios presented in Table 14, which include common equity tier 1, tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage capital as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are calculated based on the Basel III capital rules related to the measurement of capital, risk-weighted assets and average assets.
Please refer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K for detailed information for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following are Oriental’s consolidated capital ratios under the Basel III capital rules at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The following table presents a reconciliation of Oriental’s total stockholders’ equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP measures and, unlike tier 1 capital and common equity tier 1 capital, are not codified in the federal banking regulations. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’ equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which Oriental calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, Oriental has procedures in place to calculate these measures using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
The following table presents Oriental’s capital adequacy information under the Basel III capital rules:
The Bank is considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The table below shows the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Oriental’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “OFG.” At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Oriental’s market capitalization for its outstanding common stock was $952.7 million ($18.54 per share) and $1.214 billion ($23.61 per share), respectively.
The following table provides the high and low prices and dividends per share of Oriental’s common stock for each quarter of the last three calendar years:
Under Oriental’s current stock repurchase program, it is authorized to purchase in the open market up to $5.5 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The shares of common stock repurchased are to be held by Oriental as treasury shares. In 2020, Oriental repurchased 175,000 shares under this program for a total of $2.2 million, at an average price of $12.69 per share. There were no stock repurchases by Oriental in 2019.
At December 31, 2020, the number of shares that may yet be purchased under such program is estimated at 297,219 and was calculated by dividing the remaining balance of $5.5 million by $18.54 (closing price of Oriental's common stock at December 31, 2020). Oriental did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in 2020 or 2019, other than through its publicly announced stock repurchase program.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein (except for certain non-GAAP measures as previously indicated) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.
Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation.
