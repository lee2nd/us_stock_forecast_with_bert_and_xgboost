Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Introduction
The following management’s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of key factors, drivers and risks regarding the Company and the building wire industry. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and its long-term impact on our business are uncertain at this time. Developments surrounding the COVID-19 global pandemic are continuing to change daily, and we have limited visibility into the extent to which market demand for our products as well as sector manufacturing and distribution capacity will be impacted.
Executive Overview
Encore Wire sells a commodity product in a highly competitive market. Management believes that the historical strength of the Company’s growth and earnings is in large part attributable to the following main factors:
•industry-leading order fill rates and responsive customer service
•product innovations and product line expansions based on listening to and understanding customer needs and market trends
•low cost manufacturing operations, resulting from a state-of-the-art manufacturing complex
•low distribution and freight costs due in large part to the “one campus” business model
•a focused management team leading a skilled work force
•low general and administrative overhead costs, and
•a team of experienced independent manufacturers’ representatives with strong customer relationships across the United States.
These factors, and others, have allowed Encore Wire to grow from a startup in 1989 to what management believes is one of the largest electric building wire companies in the United States of America. Encore has built a loyal following of customers throughout the United States. These customers have developed a brand preference for Encore Wire in a commodity product line due to the reasons noted above, among others. The Company prides itself on striving to grow sales by expanding its product offerings where profit margins are acceptable. Senior management monitors gross margins daily, frequently extending down to the individual order level. Management strongly believes that this “hands-on” focused approach to the building wire business has been an important factor in the Company's success, and will lead to continued success.
The construction and remodeling industries drive demand for building wire. In 2020, unit sales were down 5.4% in copper wire versus 2019. In 2019, unit sales increased 4.1% in copper wire versus 2018. In 2018, unit sales of copper wire sold increased 4.5% versus 2017.
General
The Company’s operating results are driven by several key factors, including the volume of product produced and shipped, the cost of copper and other raw materials, the competitive pricing environment in the wire industry and the resulting influence on gross margins and the efficiency with which the Company’s plants operate during the period, among others. Price competition for electrical wire and cable is significant, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices. Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products. The price of copper fluctuates, depending on general economic conditions and in relation to supply and demand and other factors, which causes monthly variations in the cost of copper purchased by the Company. Additionally, the SEC allows shares of physically backed copper exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) to be listed and publicly traded. Such funds and other copper ETFs like it hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares. The acquisition of copper cathode by Copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper. In addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages, we believe that ETFs and similar copper-backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper. The Company cannot predict copper prices in the future or the effect of fluctuations in the cost of copper on the Company’s future operating results. Wire prices can, and frequently do change on a daily basis. This competitive pricing market for wire does not always mirror changes in copper prices, making margins highly volatile. Historically, the cost of aluminum has been much lower and less volatile than copper. The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.

The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Reference should also be made to the Financial Statements and the related notes included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Additional information about results for year end 2018 and certain year-on-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $1.277 billion compared to $1.275 billion during the same period in 2019 and $1.289 billion during the same period in 2018. Copper unit volume, measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire sold, decreased 5.4% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The 1.1% decrease in net sales dollars in 2019 versus 2018 is primarily the result of a 2.0% decrease in copper wire sales. Sales dollars were driven lower primarily by a 5.8% decrease in average selling price of copper wire, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in copper wire pounds shipped. Average selling prices for wire sold were primarily driven lower by falling copper commodity prices.
Cost of goods sold was $1.082 billion in 2020 versus $1.109 billion in 2019 and $1.099 million in 2018. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was mainly driven by a decrease in material costs, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in labor and overhead costs year-over year. The decrease in 2020 from 2019 reflects a 5.4% decrease in copper volume shipped, offset by a 2.6% increase in the cost of copper purchased. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was mainly driven by an increase in labor and overhead costs, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in material costs year-over year. The material cost increase in 2019 from 2018 reflects a 4.1% increase in copper volume shipped, offset by a 6.2% decrease in the cost of copper purchased.
Gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was 15.2% compared to 13.0% during the same period in 2019 and 14.7% during the same period in 2018. The average selling price of wire per copper pound sold increased 4.7% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, while the average cost of copper per pound purchased increased 2.6%. The average selling price of wire per copper pound sold decreased 5.8% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, while the average cost of copper per pound purchased decreased 6.2%.
Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $76.1 million versus $58.1 million in the same period in 2019 and $78.2 million in the same period in 2018. Fully diluted net earnings per common share were $3.68 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus $2.77 in the same period in 2019 and $3.74 in the same period in 2018.
Inventories consist of the following at December 31 (in thousands):
2020 2019 2018
Raw materials $ 40,842 $ 25,882 $ 28,455
Work-in-process 30,311 25,381 30,529
Finished goods 88,544 83,222 88,708
Total 159,697 134,485 147,692
Adjust to LIFO cost (67,375) (44,801) (45,325)
Inventory $ 92,322 $ 89,684 $ 102,367
The quantity of total copper inventory on hand increased somewhat in 2020, compared to 2019. The other materials category, which includes a large number of raw materials, had quantity changes that included increases and decreases in various other materials. This resulted in a LIFO adjustment increasing cost of sales by $22.6 million in 2020.
The quantity of total copper inventory on hand decreased somewhat in 2019, compared to 2018. The other materials category, which includes a large number of raw materials, had quantity changes that included increases and decreases in various other materials. This resulted in a LIFO adjustment decreasing cost of sales by $0.5 million in 2019.
Based on the current copper and other raw material prices, there is no LCM adjustment necessary in the periods presented above. Future reductions in the price of copper and other raw materials could require the Company to record an LCM adjustment against the related inventory balance, which would result in a negative impact on net income.
Gross profit was $194.5 million, or 15.2% of net sales, in 2020 compared to $166.0 million, or 13.0% of net sales, in 2019 and $189.7 million, or 14.7% of net sales, in 2018. The changes in gross profit were due to the factors discussed above.
Selling expenses, which are made up of freight and sales commissions, were $66.8 million in 2020, $66.0 million in 2019 and $67.0 million in 2018. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were 5.2% in all three years. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 2.3% in 2020 versus 2.2% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2018. Accounts receivable write-offs were $0.3 million in 2020, $0.2 million in 2019 and $0 in 2018. The Company increased the reserve for credit losses in 2020 by $0.7 million, and did not increase the reserve in either 2019 or 2018.
Net interest and other income was $1.3 million in 2020, $4.2 million in 2019 and $2.2 million in 2018. The decrease in 2020 reflects the economic impact of the pandemic and its effect on interest rates during the year and the resulting interest earned.
Our effective tax rate was 23.0% in 2020, 23.2% in 2019 and 23.1% in 2018. The differences between the provisions for income taxes and the income taxes computed using the federal income tax statutory rate are primarily due to changes in tax laws and state taxes.
As a result of the foregoing factors, the Company’s net income was $76.1 million in 2020, $58.1 million in 2019 and $78.2 million in 2018.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flow activities (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 57,462 $ 106,121 $ 81,590
Net cash used in investing activities (85,991) (52,456) (26,065)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (19,313) (1,105) (482)
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (47,842) $ 52,560 $ 55,043
Annual dividends paid $ (1,650) $ (1,673) $ (1,668)
The Company maintains a substantial inventory of finished products to satisfy customers’ prompt delivery requirements. As is customary in the industry, the Company provides payment terms to most of its customers that exceed terms that it receives from its suppliers. In general, the Company’s standard payment terms result in the collection of a significant majority of net sales within approximately 75 days of the date of the invoice. Therefore, the Company’s liquidity needs have generally consisted of working capital necessary to finance receivables and inventory. Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity of the Company’s manufacturing operations. The Company has historically satisfied its liquidity and capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations, borrowings under its various debt arrangements and sales of its common stock. We believe that the Company has sufficient liquidity and do not believe COVID-19 will materially impact our liquidity, but we continue to assess the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, including on our customer base and suppliers.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no debt outstanding.
The Company is party to a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with two banks, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letter of credit issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as syndication agent. The Credit Agreement extends through October 1, 2021, and provides for maximum borrowings of $150.0 million. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company signed a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which, along with other minor changes, eliminated the restriction of maximum borrowings based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable plus the amount of eligible finished goods and raw materials, less any reserves established by the banks. Additionally, at our request and subject to certain conditions, the commitments under the Credit Agreement may be increased by a maximum of up to $100.0 million as long as existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (1) LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 0.875% to 1.75% depending upon the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), or (2) the base rate (which is the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the prime rate, or LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus 0% to 0.25% (depending upon the Leverage Ratio). A commitment fee ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% (depending upon the Leverage Ratio) is payable on the unused line of credit. At December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $0.6 million left $149.4 million of credit available under the Credit Agreement. Obligations under the Credit Agreement are the only contractual borrowing obligations or commercial borrowing commitments of the Company. Obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured and contain customary covenants and events of default. The Company was in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2020.
On February 9, 2021, the Company terminated the Credit Agreement and entered into a new agreement. The Company is now party to a Credit Agreement ( the “2021 Credit Agreement”) with two banks, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letter of credit issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as syndication agent. The 2021 Credit Agreement extends through February 9, 2026, and provides for maximum borrowings of $200.0 million.
The Company paid interest totaling $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, none of which was capitalized.
On November 10, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an authorized number of shares of its common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prices determined by the President of the Company during the term of the program. The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized several increases and annual extensions of this stock repurchase program, and, as of December 31, 2020, 1,000,000 shares remained authorized for repurchase through March 31, 2021. Subsequently, the authorization for repurchase was extended through March 31, 2022. The Company repurchased 441,250 shares of its stock in 2020, and did not repurchase any shares of its stock in 2019 or 2018. The Company also has a broker agreement to repurchase stock in the open market at certain trigger points pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan announced on November 28, 2007.
Net cash provided by operations decreased $48.6 million to $57.5 million in 2020 compared to $106.1 million in 2019 and $81.6 million in 2018. The decrease in cash provided by operations of $48.6 million in 2020 versus 2019 was due to several factors. Net income increased to $76.1 million in 2020 from $58.1 million in 2019. Accounts receivable increased in 2020, resulting in cash used of $53.4 million versus cash provided of $12.3 million in 2019, a decrease in operating cash flow of $65.7 million. Accounts receivable was impacted by the $78.5 million increase in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the fourth quarter of 2019, brought on by a 21.1% increase in the average selling price per pound of copper wire sold, and a 4.3% increase in copper volume shipped. Changes in inventory resulted in cash used of $2.6 million in 2020 versus cash provided of $12.7 million in 2019, a $15.3 million decrease in cash provided. Changes in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in cash provided of $7.6 million in 2020 versus cash provided of $2.0 million in 2019, a positive swing of $5.6 million. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $48.6 million decrease in net cash flow provided by operations in 2020 versus 2019.
Net cash provided by operations increased $24.5 million to $106.1 million in 2019 compared to $81.6 million in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operations of $24.5 million in 2019 versus 2018 was due to several factors. Net income decreased to $58.1 million in 2019 from $78.2 million in 2018. Accounts receivable decreased in 2019, resulting in cash provided of $12.3 million versus cash used of $6.5 million in 2018, an increase in operating cash flow of $18.8 million. Accounts receivable generally fluctuates in proportion to dollar sales and, to a lesser extent, are affected by the timing of when sales occur during a given quarter. Additionally, accounts receivable can fluctuate based upon the payment timing patterns of certain large customers, although increases in accounts receivable at the end of quarterly reporting periods for this reason have not historically raised collectability issues. Changes in inventory resulted in cash provided of $12.7 million in 2019 versus cash used of $10.0 million in 2018, a $22.7 million increase in cash provided. Changes in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in cash provided of $2.0 million in 2019 versus cash provided of $0.2 million in 2018, a positive swing of $1.8 million. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $24.5 million increase in net cash flow provided by operations in 2019 versus 2018.
Net cash used in investing activities was $86.0 million in 2020 versus $52.5 million in 2019 and $26.1 million in 2018. In 2020, capital expenditures were used primarily for the construction of our new service center, the acceleration of spending for our repurposed distribution center, and the purchase and installation of machinery and equipment throughout the Company. In 2019 and 2018, capital expenditures were used primarily for the purchase and installation of machinery and equipment throughout the Company.
The net cash used by financing activities of $19.3 million in 2020 consisted primarily of $20.7 million used to purchase Company stock and dividend payments of $1.7 million, partially offset by $3.0 million proceeds from issuance of Company stock related to employees exercising stock options. The net cash used by financing activities of $1.1 million in 2019 consisted primarily of $1.7 million in dividend payments offset by $0.6 million proceeds from issuance of Company stock related to employees exercising stock options. The net cash used by financing activities of $0.5 million in 2018 consisted primarily of $1.7 million in dividend payments, offset by $1.2 million proceeds from issuance of Company stock related to employees exercising stock options.
Our two-phased expansion plans announced earlier this year continue in earnest and remain on schedule. The construction of the new service center is progressing well with a planned opening in the second quarter of 2021. Phase two of our expansion plans will focus on repurposing our existing distribution center to expand manufacturing capacity and extend our market reach. Spending on Phase two has already commenced as we have accelerated the timing of orders with manufacturers due to increased lead times required for certain machinery and equipment in the current environment. Phase two completion is anticipated in early 2022. Total capital expenditures were $86 million in 2020. We expect total capital expenditures to range from $100 - $120 million in 2021, $50 - $70 million in 2022, and $40 - $60 million in 2023. Our strong balance sheet and ability to consistently generate high levels of operating cash flow should provide ample allowance to fund planned capital expenditures.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its financial statements.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first out (LIFO) method, or market. The Company maintains two inventory pools for LIFO purposes. As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO. The Company applies the lower of cost or market (LCM) test by comparing the LIFO cost of its raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories to estimated market values, which are based primarily upon the most recent quoted market price of copper and other raw materials and finished wire prices as of the end of each reporting period. The Company performs a lower of cost or market calculation quarterly. As of December 31, 2020, no LCM adjustment was required. However, decreases in copper and other material prices could necessitate establishing an LCM reserve in future periods. Additionally, future reductions in the quantity of inventory on hand could cause copper or other raw materials that are carried in inventory at costs different from the cost of copper and other raw materials in the period in which the reduction occurs to be included in costs of goods sold for that period at the different price.
Revenue from the sale of the Company’s products is recognized when goods are shipped to the customer, title and risk of loss are transferred, pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. A provision for payment discounts and customer rebates is estimated based upon historical experience and other relevant factors and is recorded within the same period that the revenue is recognized.
The Company has provided an allowance for credit losses on customer receivables based upon estimates of those customers’ inability to make required payments. Such allowance is established and adjusted based upon the makeup of the current receivable portfolio, past bad debt experience and current market conditions. If the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments to the Company, additional allowances for losses might be required in future periods.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to communicate changes to the codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. The following are those ASUs that are relevant to the Company.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” which makes significant changes to the accounting for credit losses on financial assets and disclosures about them. This ASU requires immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses. Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred, which FASB has noted delayed recognition of expected losses that might not yet have met the threshold of being probable. The guidance affects all entities in all industries and applies to a wide variety of financial assets, including trade receivables. We adopted this new standard January 1, 2020 and applied a loss rate model to compute the expected credit loss allowance of our short-term trade receivable balances, which we concluded are representative of one collective pool. This method is based on relevant information from past events, including historical experiences, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. Our evaluation of the new standard concluded that it had no material impact on our financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. We are evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but do not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial statements or disclosures.
Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains various forward-looking statements and information that are based on management’s belief as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected.
Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the Company’s operating results and stock price are:
•fluctuations in the global and national economy
•the impact of a global pandemic
•fluctuations in the level of activity in the construction industry, including remodeling
•demand for the Company’s products
•the impact of price competition on the Company’s margins
•fluctuations in the price of copper, aluminum and other key raw materials
•the loss of key manufacturers’ representatives who sell the Company’s product line
•fluctuations in utility costs, especially electricity and natural gas, and freight costs
•fluctuations in insurance costs and the availability of coverage of various types
•weather related disasters at the Company’s and/or key vendor’s operating facilities
