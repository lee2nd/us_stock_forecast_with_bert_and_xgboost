Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a clinical-stage chemoprotection oncology company focused on fundamentally transforming the experience of chemotherapy for cancer patients, enabling them to fight cancer without the fear or burden of chemotherapy-induced side effects. ALRN-6924, our first-in-class MDM2/MDMX dual inhibitor activating p53, is the only reported therapeutic agent in clinical development to employ a biomarker strategy, in which we exclusively focus on treating patients with p53-mutated cancers. With this targeted strategy of treating patients with p53-mutated cancers, ALRN-6924 is designed to selectively protect multiple healthy cell types throughout the body from chemotherapy while ensuring we do not protect cancer cells.
Based on its mechanism of action and reported data from our Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ALRN-6924 in patients with p53-mutated small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, who are being treated with the chemotherapy topotecan, we believe that there may be a significant opportunity to develop ALRN-6924 as an agent to reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy in the bone marrow of cancer patients without adversely impacting the anti-cancer activity of chemotherapy against p53-mutant tumors. This is a concept known as “chemoprotection”. Biologically, the same mechanism of action can be expected to also lead to protection of healthy normal cells outside of the bone marrow, which may lead to a form of protection against side effects such as alopecia, mucositis, nausea and other side effects. We plan to explore the chemoprotective effects of ALRN-6924 in other normal tissues and organs, such as the skin, hair follicles and the gastrointestinal tract in future, randomized clinical studies.
Our clinical development program for ALRN-6924 includes our recently completed Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent in patients with SCLC being treated with the chemotherapy topotecan, our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of ALRN-6924 in healthy volunteers and a planned Phase 1b placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, being treated with frontline chemotherapy- or immunochemotherapy.
We completed the trial, including enrolling an additional 11 SCLC patients in order to complete the evaluation of the dose-response relationship. A preliminary evaluation of data from those 11 patients (seven patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg ALRN-6924 six hours before topotecan and four patients receiving 0.2 mg/kg ALRN-6924 twenty-four hours before topotecan) supports our belief that administering ALRN-6924 at 0.3mg/kg and 24 hours before topotecan remains the optimal schedule. We expect to submit final results for presentation at a scientific conference in the second half of 2021.
Reported data from this trial have informed our choice of the recommended dose of ALRN-6924 for subsequent clinical trials, including a Phase 1b trial in patients with NSCLC.
In the second quarter of 2021 we plan to initiate a new Phase 1b clinical trial to assess ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent in advanced patients with p53-mutated NSCLC being treated with first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed with or without an immune checkpoint inhibitor. This trial is randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and it is designed to evaluate the potential chemoprotective effects of ALRN-6924 in this patient population. We plan to begin enrolling patients in the NSCLC trial in the second quarter of 2021 and we anticipate reporting interim data (10-20 patients) at the end of 2021 and topline results (60 patients) in mid-2022.
We are also conducting a trial of ALRN-6924 in healthy human volunteers to characterize the time to onset, magnitude, and duration of cell cycle arrest in human bone marrow relative to ALRN-6924 administration, with the goal of developing a universal dosing regimen for ALRN-6924 for use as a chemoprotection agent across a range of additional chemotherapies and tumor indications. Results from the trial remain on track to be reported in mid-2021 and will be submitted for a presentation at a medical conference in second half of 2021.
In addition, we are now investing in CMC development of ALRN-6924 and in the development of a p53 companion diagnostic to support initiation of clinical registration trials upon the completion of our Phase 1b clinical trial in NSCLC. To that purpose, we plan to engage as appropriate with the FDA in 2021 to discuss the ALRN-6924 development program.
Subject to obtaining additional funding, we plan to expand our chemoprotection clinical program to other cancer indications and pursue a development path that aims at a tumor-agnostic label for ALRN-6924 as a chemoprotective agent, across many tumor types and chemotherapy regimens.
We were incorporated in 2001 and commenced principal operations in 2006. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our product candidates, including ALRN-6924, developing our proprietary stabilized cell-permeating peptide platform, building our intellectual property portfolio, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
To date, we have financed our operations primary through $50.0 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, $23.8 million in net proceeds from a private placement in April 2019, $10.2 million in net proceeds from a public offering in June 2020, $33.1 million in net proceeds from a registered direct offering in January 2021, $23.9 million in net proceeds from “at the market” offerings, $4.4 million in net proceeds from sales pursuant to an equity line financing, $131.2 million from our sales of preferred stock prior to our IPO, $0.6 million from the exercise of stock options and $34.9 million from a collaboration agreement.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses on an aggregate basis. Our net losses were $21.2 million and $29.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $219.3 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities, licensing and patent investment and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years.
As a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements, or other sources of capital. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Market conditions are volatile and may continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future, which may limit our ability to raise capital. In addition, while we may seek one or more collaborators for future development of our product candidates for one or more indications, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration for ALRN-6924 for such indications on suitable terms, on a timely basis or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate some or all of our clinical and drug development programs and future commercialization efforts. We may also be forced to take other actions that could adversely affect our business.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
We believe that, based on our current operating plan, our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.8 million as of December 31, 2020, together with the net proceeds of approximately $33.1 million from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in a registered direct public offering on January 8, 2021, net proceeds of approximately $20.0 million from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in at-market-offerings under Capital on Demand Sales Agreements between January 1, 2021 and the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock from our common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC between January 1, 2021 and the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the second half of 2023. Our funding estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control,
could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate. In any event, our cash, cash equivalents and investments will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development or commercialization of ALRN-6924. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Our future viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations. In the first half of 2020 we implemented various cost savings measures, including the elimination of previously planned research activities and a shift to a remote work environment, due to our limited cash resources and the uncertainty associated with the coronavirus pandemic.
COVID-19
In March 2020, we began precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and partners and prospective clinical trial participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States and worldwide, certain national, state and local governmental authorities have issued orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive orders, proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, the conduct of our clinical studies with our external partners has been adjusted to institute virtual clinical trial site training and site monitoring, along with partnering with sites to minimize patient visits and institute telemedicine to minimize patient exposure.
While the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly impact our business or results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations is unknown and will depend on future developments. Such future events are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments or we may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced patient traffic and reduced operations. In particular, the speed of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, and the magnitude of interventions to contain the spread of the virus, such as government-imposed quarantines, including shelter-in-place mandates, sweeping restrictions on travel, mandatory shutdowns for non-essential businesses, requirements regarding social distancing, and other public health safety measures, will determine the impact of the pandemic on our business. We are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Components of our Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties.
Operating Expenses
Our expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has created substantial uncertainties in the United States and throughout the world, including in the financial markets and in the biopharmaceutical industry. . We are continuing to assess our strategy as the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic is better understood.
In 2021, we raised additional capital through our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in a registered direct public offering on January 8, 2021, from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in at-market-offerings under Capital on Demand Sales Agreements, and from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock under our common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources. We expect that our operating expenses will increase if and as we use the proceeds of such sales of our common stock to increase our level of clinical development of ALRN-6924 and hire additional personnel to carry out such clinical development.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, and include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•
the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•
third-party license fees;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.
We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs and milestone payments made under our licensing arrangements by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, license payments made under our licensing arrangements or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates. These costs are included in employee, facility and other development expenses in the table below. Employee, facility and other expenses also includes internal research relating to non-clinical and pipeline compounds in oncology and non-oncology indications.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses:
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses in the foreseeable future as we continue our ongoing clinical trials of ALRN-6924, initiate additional clinical trials of ALRN-6924 and pursue later stages of clinical development of ALRN-6924.
We cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of ALRN-6924 will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•
the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our ongoing clinical trial of ALRN-6924, as well as of any future clinical trials of ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop and other research and development activities that we may conduct;
•
uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;
•
significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;
•
the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and
•
the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance and corporate and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses are comprised of professional fees associated with being a public company including costs of accounting, auditing, legal, regulatory, tax and consulting services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs; and both public and investor relations costs. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; other insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments and other income and expense items that are not classified as operating expenses. Interest expense consists of imputed interest expense related to our construction financing liability associated with the build-out and tenant improvements to our previously leased office and laboratory facility.
Income Taxes
Since our inception in 2001, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in any year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $203.5 million and $197.7 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2029 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2025. The Company also has federal orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of $1.0 million which begin to expire in 2039.
Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. We have not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study. If we have experienced a change of control, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, which is determined by first multiplying the value of our common stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contract and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
CROs in connection with performing research activities on our behalf and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;
•
investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials;
•
vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and
•
vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.
Effective October 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2018-07"), which sets out to simplify the accounting for non-employee share-based awards.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07 for share-based awards granted to non-employees, including consultants, compensation expense was recognized over the period during which services were rendered by such non-employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of the unvested awards were remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
After adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of the grant. The compensation expense for awards granted to non-employees is recognized, without changes in the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the respective award. The compensation expense for awards granted to non-employees was measured as of the adoption date of October 1, 2018, and this amount is the basis for prospective expense recognition.
We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $11.2 million, compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $6.5 million was primarily due to a $4.2 million decrease in clinical development cost of ALRN-6924 resulting from the completion of anti-cancer clinical trials in 2019 and early 2020. In addition, employee, facility and other development expenses also decreased by $1.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in employee, facility and other development costs was a result of an early 2020 decision to focus clinical development of ALRN-6924 solely on chemoprotection and as a result we reduced our research and development headcount from seven to five employees.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $3.0 million in general and administrative expense is primarily a result of cost savings initiatives that were implemented in 2019 and in early 2020. The effect of these measures resulted in savings of $1.5 million in headcount related costs, $1.1 million in external spending primarily related to legal expenses and a $0.3 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other expense, net of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $0.1 million and is offset by a non-cash derecognition charge of our former corporate headquarters of $0.8 million. On November 11, 2020, we entered into a lease termination agreement with respect to our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts. In connection with the lease termination we derecognized our right of use assets and operating lease liabilities associated with the lease. The derecognition of these assets and liabilities resulted in a non-cash charge of $0.8 million. We anticipate that our interest income will fluctuate in the future in response to our level of cash, cash equivalents and investments, and then current interest rates.
Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted solely of interest income of $0.6 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses on an aggregate basis. We have not yet commercialized any product candidate, including ALRN-6924, which is in clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. We have financed our operations through sales of common stock in our initial public offering and follow-on public offerings, sales of common stock and warrants in a private placement, sales of common stock in “at-the-market” offerings under the Capital on Demand Sales Agreements, sales of common stock under our equity line with LPC, sales of preferred stock prior to our initial public offering and payments received under a collaboration agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.8 million.
Public Offerings
In June 2020, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 10,162,059 shares of common stock, including an additional 1,071,149 shares of common stock upon the partial exercise of the option of the underwriter to purchase additional shares of common stock, for a purchase price to the public of $1.10 per share. We received aggregate gross proceeds from the public offering of approximately $11.2 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $0.9 million.
In January 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 32,630,983 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering at a purchase price per share of $1.10. The aggregate gross proceeds of the registered direct offering were $35.9 million, before deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by us of approximately $2.8 million.
At-the-Market Offering
In July 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement with JonesTrading, under which we currently may issue and sell shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $15.0 million. Sales of common stock through JonesTrading may be made by any method that is deemed an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,160,899 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $4.0 million, before deducting commissions and fees. Between January 1, 2021 and January 28, 2021, we sold an additional 7,174,993 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $9.7 million, before deducting commissions and fees.
In January 2021, we entered into a Capital on Demand Sales Agreement, or the ATM Sales Agreement, with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, or JonesTrading, and William Blair & Company, L.L.C., or William Blair, as agents, under which we may issue and sell shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price to up to $30.0 million. Sales of common stock through JonesTrading and William Blair may be made by any method that is deemed an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement. Between January 29, 2021 and March 24, 2021, we have issued and sold an aggregate of 5,225,406 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $10.6 million, after deducting commissions and fees.
Equity Line Financing
On September 21, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital, LLC or LPC for an equity line financing. The Purchase Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC, and LPC is obligated to purchased up to $15.0 million of shares of common stock at our sole discretion, over a 36-month period that commenced in October 2020. We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 covering the sale of shares of common stock that are issued to LPC under the Purchase Agreement, which was declared effective on October 15, 2020.
Upon entering into the Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold 367,647 shares of common stock, or the Initial Purchase Shares, to LPC at a price per share of $1.36, or $0.5 million, which is part of the $15.0 million of shares of common stock that we may sell to LPC under the Purchase Agreement. Additionally, we issued to LPC as a commitment fee 220,588 shares of common stock as consideration for LPC entering into the Purchase Agreement.
Under the Purchase Agreement, we may, at our discretion, direct LPC to purchase on any single business day, or a Regular Purchase, up to (i) 250,000 shares of common stock if the closing sale price of our common stock is not below $1.50 per share on Nasdaq, (ii) 200,000 shares of common stock if the closing sale price of our common stock is not below $1.00 per share on Nasdaq or (iii) 150,000 shares of common stock if the closing sale price of our common stock is below $1.00 per share on Nasdaq. In any case, LPC’s commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $1,000,000.
The purchase price per share for each such Regular Purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of our common stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the Purchase Agreement. Under the Purchase Agreement, we may not effect any sales of shares of common stock on any purchase date that the closing sale price of our common stock on Nasdaq is less than the floor price of $0.30 per share.
In addition to Regular Purchases, we may also direct LPC to purchase other amounts as accelerated purchases or as additional accelerated purchases on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
The net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to us will depend on the frequency of sales and the number of shares sold to LPC and prices at which we sell shares to LPC.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and termination provisions. LPC has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our common stock. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future financings (other than restrictions on our ability to enter into additional “equity line” or a substantially similar transaction whereby a specific investor is irrevocably bound pursuant to an agreement with us to purchase securities over a period of time from us at a price based on the market price of the common stock at the time of such purchase), rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our sole discretion, without any cost or penalty. During any “event of default” under the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park does not have the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement; however, we may not initiate any purchase of shares by LPC until such event of default is cured. Through December 31, 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,417,647 shares of common stock to LPC for gross proceeds of $1,801 million. Between January 1, 2021 and March 24, 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,375,000 shares of common stock to LPC for gross proceeds of $2.6 million.
Private Placement
On April 2, 2019, we issued and sold in a private placement an aggregate of (i) 11,838,582 units, consisting of 11,838,582 shares of its common stock and associated warrants, or the common warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 11,838,582 shares of common stock, for a combined price of $2.01 per unit and (ii) 1,096,741 units, consisting of (a) pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,096,741 shares of our common stock and (b) associated common warrants to purchase 1,096,741 shares of common stock, for a combined price of $2.01 per unit. The pre-funded warrants had an exercise price of $0.01 per share and had no expiration. The common warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $2.00 per share and expire five years from the date of issuance. The securities were sold pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into with accredited investors on March 28, 2019. We received aggregate gross proceeds from the private placement of approximately $26.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately $2.2 million and excluding the exercise of any warrants. In July 2019, all outstanding pre-funded warrants were exercised for 1,096,741 shares of common stock.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $20.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $21.2 million and cash provided by the change in operating assets of $1.3 million offset by non-cash charges of $2.0 million. Non-cash charges resulted primarily from stock-based compensation expense. The derecognition of our right-to-use lease assets and operating lease liabilities resulted in operating cash flow usage of $0.8 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2020 consisted primarily of a decrease of $1.7 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and an increase of $0.7 million in prepaid expense and other assets.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $26.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $29.4 million and cash provided by the change in operating assets of $0.9 million offset by non-cash charges of $2.1 million. Non-cash charges resulted primarily from stock-based compensation expense. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of an increase of $0.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as well as a decrease of $1.3 million in other assets. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in payroll-related accruals.
Investing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, investing activities provided $6.4 million of cash. We received $16.2 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and $0.2 million from the sale of property and equipment offset by $10.0 million of purchases of investments.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, investing activities used $2.8 million of cash. We received $24.6 million of proceeds from the sale of investments offset by $27.2 million of purchases of investments and $0.2 million of purchases of property and equipment.
Financing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $15.8 million due to the proceeds received from the sale of common stock in our public offering in June 2020, sales under our Sales Agreement with JonesTrading, funds received from sales of common stock to LPC during 2020 and proceeds from the Paycheck Protection Program Loan of $0.4 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $24.0 million due to the proceeds received from the sale of common stock, common warrants and pre-funded warrants in our April 2019 private placement and due to the proceeds from option exercises.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing development activities related to ALRN-6924, which is still in clinical development, and any other product candidates and programs that we may pursue in the future. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•
conduct our current, planned and future clinical trials of ALRN-6924;
•
initiate and resume research and preclinical and clinical development of any other product candidates that we may develop;
•
seek to identify additional product candidates;
•
seek marketing approvals for any product candidate that successfully completes clinical trials, if any;
•
require the manufacture of larger quantities of our product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies;
•
hire and retain additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;
•
build out new facilities or expand existing facilities to support our ongoing development activity; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development, any future commercialization efforts and our compliance with our obligations as a public company.
We believe that, based on our current operating plan, our cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.8 million as of December 31, 2020, together with the net proceeds of approximately $33.1 million from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in a registered direct public offering on January 8, 2021,net proceeds of approximately $20.0 million from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock in at-market-offerings under Capital on Demand Sales Agreements between January 1, 2021 and the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million from our issuance and sale of shares of common stock from our common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC between January 1, 2021 and the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the second half of 2023. Our funding estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate. In any event, our cash, cash equivalents and investments will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development or commercialization of ALRN-6924. Our future viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations.
Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements, or other sources of capital. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, while we may seek one or more collaborators for future development of ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration for ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop on suitable terms, on a timely basis or at all.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of ALRN-6924 and other product candidates that we may develop and programs we may pursue, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of ALRN-6924 or other product candidates that we may develop. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of our ongoing, planned and future clinical trials of ALRN-6924;
•
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical research and clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may develop;
•
the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•
the success of any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties;
•
the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates, although we currently have no commitments or agreements to complete any such transactions;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any product candidate for which we receive marketing approval, to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator that we may have at such time;
•
the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any product candidate receive marketing approval;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
our headcount growth and associated costs, as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Other than the Purchase Agreement with LPC, which is subject to certain limitations and conditions, we do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Additional debt or preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce and/or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
