General Overview
COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the United States economy and it is anticipated that its negative impact to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations will continue. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate what the total impact may be. The pandemic has resulted in workforce and travel restrictions and created business disruptions in supply chain, production and demand across many business sectors. Equipment orders in our professional sales service segment have been negatively impacted, and we do anticipate continued negative impact in all our business at least through the next few quarters, in particular in our professional sales service segment for the diagnostic imaging equipment. Moreover, we have also experienced the negative impact in the recurring revenue business in our IT segment as some of our customers have been adversely affected by the shutdown, and new business in this segment appears to be slower as well. The pandemic also may have a negative impact on our cash receipts as some customers request forbearance or a delay in their payments to us.
The pandemic may impact our operations in 2021, depending on the duration of the pandemic and the timing and success of the reopening of the economy.
We have taken significant steps in our efforts to protect our workforce and our clients. Most of our employees have been working at least partially remotely and we are implementing plans to reopen our work sites consistent with the guidelines promulgated by the CDC and respective state governments. In addition, the Company received a $3.6 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act (the “PPP loan”). This loan, substantially all of which should qualify for forgiveness, has been used to principally cover our payroll costs for a period of time as specified by the rules, thereby allowing us to maintain our workforce and continue to provide services and solutions to our clients. We have applied for forgiveness of the PPP loan.
Our Business Segments
Vaso Corporation (formerly Vasomedical, Inc.) (“Vaso”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 1987. We principally operate in three distinct business segments in the healthcare equipment and information technology industries. We manage and evaluate our operations, and report our financial results, through these three business segments.
●
IT segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoTechnology, Inc., primarily focuses on healthcare IT and managed network technology services;
●
Professional sales service segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary Vaso Diagnostics, Inc. d/b/a VasoHealthcare, primarily focuses on the sale of healthcare capital equipment for General Electric Healthcare (GEHC) into the health provider middle market; and
●
Equipment segment, primarily focuses on the design, manufacture, sale and service of proprietary medical devices, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoMedical, Inc., which in turn operates through Vasomedical Solutions, Inc. for domestic business and Vasomedical Global Corp. for international business, respectively.
VasoTechnology
VasoTechnology, Inc. was formed in May 2015, at the time the Company acquired all of the assets of NetWolves, LLC and its affiliates, including the membership interests in NetWolves Network Services LLC (collectively, “NetWolves”). It currently consists of a managed network and security service division (NetWolves) and a healthcare IT application VAR (value added reseller) division (VasoHealthcare IT). Its current offering includes:
●
Managed diagnostic imaging applications (channel partner of select vendors of healthcare IT products).
●
Managed network infrastructure (routers, switches and other core equipment).
●
Managed network transport (FCC licensed carrier reselling 175+ facility partners).
●
Managed security services.
VasoTechnology uses a combination of proprietary technology, methodology and best-in-class third-party applications to deliver its value proposition.
VasoHealthcare
VasoHealthcare commenced operations in 2010, in conjunction with the Company’s execution of its exclusive sales representation agreement with GEHC, which is the healthcare business division of the General Electric Company (“GE”), to further the sale of certain medical capital equipment in certain domestic market segments.
VasoHealthcare’s current offering consists of:
●
GEHC diagnostic imaging capital equipment.
●
GEHC service agreements for the above equipment.
●
GEHC training services for use of the above equipment.
●
GEHC and third-party financial services for the above equipment.
VasoHealthcare has built a team of over 80 highly experienced sales professionals who utilize highly focused sales management and analytic tools to manage the complete sales process and to increase market penetration.
VasoMedical
The proprietary medical equipment business under VasoMedical traces back to 1995 when the Company began the proprietary Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP®) technology in the United States and has since diversified to include other medical hardware and software. Vasomedical Global was formed in 2011 to combine and coordinate the various international operations including design, development, manufacturing, and sales of medical devices, while domestic activities are under Vasomedical Solutions. These devices primarily consist of cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic systems, including:
●
Biox™ series Holter monitors and ambulatory blood pressure recorders.
●
ARCS™ series analysis, reporting and communication software for ECG and blood pressure signals.
●
MobiCare™ multi-parameter wireless vital-sign monitoring system.
●
EECP® therapy systems for non-invasive, outpatient treatment of ischemic heart disease.
This segment uses its extensive cardiovascular device knowledge coupled with its engineering resources to cost effectively create and market its proprietary technology. It sells and services its products to domestic customers directly and sells and/or services its products in the international market mainly through independent distributors.
Strategic Plan and Objectives
Our short- and long-term plans for the growth of the Company and to increase stockholder value are:
●
Continue to effectively reduce operating costs.
●
Continue to expand our product and service offerings as well as market penetration in the business of our IT segment.
●
Maintain and improve business performance in our professional sales service segment by increasing market penetration of the GE Healthcare product modalities we represent, and possibly building new teams to represent other vendors.
●
Maintain and grow our equipment business by increasing efficiency and exploring new revenue models.
●
Continue to seek accretive partnership opportunities.
Revision of prior year financial statements
The income statement, balance sheet and changes in stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been corrected for immaterial errors as a result of what we believe to be the misappropriation of funds by a mid-level management employee, who was not an officer or director of the Company. The correction includes $190 thousand in additional SG&A expense in the year ended December 31, 2019 and a beginning balance addition of total $907 thousand to accumulated deficit at January 1, 2019, of which $333 thousand represents a charge as of the May 2015 acquisition date of the subsidiary affected. The effect on net income (loss) for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2018 is not material. The individual was suspended on March 29, 2021 and was terminated effective April 1, 2021. Upon additional examination and comprehensive review, the Company believes that this was an isolated incident and non-recurring. The Company has taken immediate steps to implement additional internal control procedures. See also Item 9A - Controls and Procedures.
In addition, the Company noted accounting errors in our IT segment where certain regulatory fees billed to our customers during the years 2016 through 2019 were partially recorded as revenue. Correction of such errors resulted in a $147 thousand addition to accumulated deficit at January 1, 2019 and the reversal of $231 thousand in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019.
See Note B for tabular presentation of selected line items from the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements illustrating the effect of these corrections.
Results of Operations - For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Total revenues decreased by $5,665,000, or 7.5%, to $69,850,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, from $75,515,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019. We reported net income (loss) of $358,000 and $(382,000) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an improvement of $740,000. The change to net income from net loss was primarily due to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower gross profit. Our net income (loss) was $0.00 and $(0.00) per basic and diluted common share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Revenues
Revenue in the IT segment was $43,894,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $45,505,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $1,611,000, or 3.5%, of which $1,557,000 was attributable to a decline in VHC-IT revenues and $54,000 to a decrease in NetWolves revenues.
Commission revenues in the professional sales service segment decreased by $3,343,000, or 12.8%, to $22,865,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $26,208,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume of GEHC equipment delivered in 2020 coupled with a lower blended commission rate for equipment delivered in 2020. As discussed in Note C to the financial statements, the Company defers recognition of commission revenue until the underlying equipment is delivered. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded on its consolidated balance sheet deferred commission revenue of $17,689,000 for this segment (of which $6,178,000 is long-term), a decrease of $876,000, or 4.7%, compared to $18,565,000 of deferred commission revenue at December 31, 2019 (of which $6,645,000 was long-term). The decrease in deferred revenue is due principally to lower total orders booked during the year, partially offset by the decrease in equipment deliveries over the same period.
Revenue in our equipment segment decreased 18.7% to $3,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3,802,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of including EECP operations only for the first quarter of 2020 in the consolidated financials but for the full year of 2019, partially offset by a revenue increase in our China operations. In April 2020, the Company sold 51% of the equity in its EECP business and does not consolidate these operations after such date. With EECP revenues all excluded in 2020 and 2019, equipment segment revenue would be respectively $2,726,000 and $2,532,000, an increase of $194,000, or 7.7%, mainly a result of higher revenue in our China operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded on its consolidated balance sheet for this segment $15,000 of deferred revenue, of which $10,000 is long-term, compared to $778,000 of deferred revenue at December 31, 2019, of which $354,000 was long-term, a decrease of $763,000 or 98.1%. The decrease in deferred revenue is due principally to the sale of a majority equity stake in the EECP business.
Gross Profit
The Company recorded gross profit of $38,571,000, or 55% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $42,432,000, or 56% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $3,861,000, or 9.1%, was due primarily to a $2,679,000 decrease in the professional sales service segment and a $1,108,000 decrease in the IT segment, both as a result of lower revenues.
IT segment gross profit decreased to $17,682,000, or 40% of segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $18,790,000, or 41% of segment revenues, in the prior year, a decrease of $1,108,000, of which $909,000 was attributable to VHC-IT and $199,000 was attributable to NetWolves, resulting mainly from lower VHC-IT revenues and higher Netwolves costs.
Professional sales service segment gross profit was $18,608,000, or 81% of the segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2,679,000, or 12.6%, from segment gross profit of $21,287,000, or 81% of the segment revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the decrease in equipment delivery volume. Cost of commissions decreased by $664,000, or 13.5%, to $4,257,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to cost of commissions of $4,921,000 in 2019. The decrease is due primarily to the decrease in delivery volume. Cost of commissions reflects commission expense associated with certain recognized commission revenues. Commission expense associated with deferred revenue is recorded as deferred commission expense until the related commission revenue is earned.
Equipment segment gross profit decreased to $2,281,000, or 74% of equipment segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,355,000, or 62% of equipment segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to the inclusion of EECP operations only for the first quarter of 2020 in the consolidated financials but for the full year of 2019, partially offset but an increase in gross profit of our China operations. Excluding EECP operations from both 2020 and 2019 numbers, gross profit in the equipment segment would be $2,040,000 (74.8% of segment revenue) and $1,887,000 (74.5% of segment revenue), respectively, representing an increase of $153,000 or 8.1%, year over year. Equipment segment gross profits are dependent on a number of factors including the mix of products sold, their respective models and average selling prices, the ongoing costs of training, maintenance and servicing, as well as certain fixed period costs, including facilities, payroll and insurance.
Operating Income
Operating income was $772,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to operating income of $591,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $181,000, or 30.6%. The improvement was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating loss in the equipment segment to $155,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from a loss of $855,000 for the prior year, an improvement of $700,000, due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in operating income in the professional sales service segment to $2,977,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3,626,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to lower gross profit partially offset by reduced operating expenses.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $37,054,000, or 53% of revenues, and $41,028,000, or 54% of revenues, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $3,974,000 or 10%. The decrease in SG&A expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted primarily from a $2,030,000 decrease in the professional sales service segment attributable mainly to lower sales personnel-related and travel costs; a $1,090,000 decrease in the IT segment due to lower personnel, marketing and travel costs; a $646,000 decrease in the equipment segment due mainly to the deconsolidation of the EECP business, and by a $208,000 decrease in corporate expenses reflecting lower legal and accounting fees.
Research and development (R&D) expenses of $745,000, or 1% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $68,000, or 8%, from $813,000, or 1% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower new product development costs in our China operations.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net (loss) income, plus net interest expense (income), tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash expenses for share-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric that is used by the investment community for comparative and valuation purposes. We disclose this metric in order to support and facilitate the dialogue with research analysts and investors.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
A reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below:
(in thousands)
Adjusted EBITDA increased by $69,000, to $3,582,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3,513,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the higher net income, partially offset by lower interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation costs, as compared to the prior year.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $(415,000) and $(862,000), respectively, a decrease in net expense of $447,000. The decrease was due primarily to lower interest expense on our lines of credit and other debt instruments, and by the $110,000 gain on sale of equity in the EECP business.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded income tax benefit of $1,000, as compared to income tax expense of $111,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company utilized $797,000 and $0 in net operating loss carryforwards for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change to income tax benefit in 2020 arose primarily from lower foreign tax expense due to write-off of deferred tax liability. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $45 million at December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Cash Flow - For the year ended December 31,
We have financed our operations and investment activities primarily from working capital and borrowings. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6,819,000 and negative working capital of $9,431,000. $9,162,000 in negative working capital at December 31, 2020 is attributable to the net balance of deferred commission expense and deferred revenue. These are non-cash expense and revenue items and have no impact on future cash flows. At April 23, 2021 the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $9.5 million.
Cash provided by operating activities was $5,934,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of net income after non-cash adjustments of $3,377,000 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2,557,000. The changes in the account balances primarily reflect decreases in accounts and other receivables and deferred commission expenses of $5,050,000 and $407,000, respectively, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable, deferred revenue, and accrued commissions of $1,369,000, $870,000, and $791,000, respectively.
Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $575,000 consisting of $1,000,000 in purchases of equipment and software and $725,000 in purchase of short-term investment, offset by $1,150,000 in proceeds from sale of equity in EECP Global.
Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $553,000, primarily attributable to repayment of $1,375,000 on our lines of credit, and $2,930,000 in payments of notes and finance leases, partially offset by proceeds of $3,756,000 from notes payable, including $3,610,900 from a PPP loan.
Liquidity
The Company expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its obligations for the next twelve months. It is anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our operations depending on the duration of the pandemic and the timing and success of the reopening of the economy.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPES), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we are not involved in any unconsolidated SPES or other off-balance sheet arrangements.
Effects of Inflation
We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past two years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or on our results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
We account for revenues in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which was adopted as of January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis.
ASC 606 requires certain judgments and estimates in implementing its five-step process to be followed in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition and related disclosures. Refer to Note C of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding significant judgments involved in our application of ASC 606.
Inventories, net
We value inventories in the equipment segment at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, particularly raw materials and components, and records a provision for excess and slow moving inventory based primarily on existing and anticipated design and engineering changes to its products as well as forecasts of future product demand.
In our IT Segment, we purchase computer hardware and software for specific customer requirements and value such inventories at the lower of cost or estimated market, with cost being determined on the specific identification method.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The Company accounts for goodwill under the guidance of the ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles: Goodwill and Other”. Goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment, at least annually, in accordance with this guidance. The recoverability of goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not result in an impairment. The impairment test is based on the estimated fair value of the underlying businesses and performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Intangible assets consist of the value of customer contracts and relationships, patent and technology costs, and software. The cost of significant customer-related intangibles is amortized in proportion to estimated total related revenue; cost of other intangible assets is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated economic life, which range from five to ten years. The Company capitalizes internal use software costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
Deferred Revenues
For the professional sales service segment, amounts billable under the agreement with GE Healthcare in advance of customer acceptance of the equipment are recorded initially as deferred revenue, and commission revenue is subsequently recognized as customer acceptance of such equipment is reported to us by GEHC.
For the equipment segment, we record revenue on extended service contracts ratably over the term of the related contract period.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and loss carry forwards for which income tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than an enactment of changes in the tax laws or rates. Deferred tax assets are continually evaluated for realizability. To the extent our judgment regarding the realization of the deferred tax assets changes, an adjustment to the allowance is recorded, with an offsetting increase or decrease, as appropriate, in income tax expense. Such adjustments are recorded in the period in which our estimate as to the realizability of the assets changed that it is “more likely than not” that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The “more likely than not” standard is subjective and is based upon our estimate of a greater than 50% probability that the deferred tax asset will be realized.
We also comply with the provisions of the ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”, which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Based on its analysis, the Company has determined that it has not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviations from its position.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a description of the Company’s evaluation of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
