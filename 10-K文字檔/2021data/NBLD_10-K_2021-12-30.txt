ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
Overview
We are engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry. We currently generate revenue from service fees (video creation and production and referral fees from our LoseTheAgent.com website). At the core of our programs is our proprietary video creation technology which allows for an automated conversion of data (text, video slices and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice over and music. We provide video search, storage and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web and mobile. Once a home, personal or community video is created using our proprietary technology, it can be published to social media, email or distributed to multiple real estate websites.
In addition, we own and operate the web site LoseTheAgent.com, which is a site dedicated to peer-to-peer real estate transactions between home sellers and buyers - the so called For Sale By Owner segment. We currently have approximately 100,000 home listings across all 50 states. LoseTheAgent.com website traffic increased 105% in users and 114% in page views over the 11 months ending November 30, 2021, compared to the same period ending November 30, 2020. After adjusting for the discontinuance of advertising and marketing expenditures in February 2020, LoseTheAgent.com website traffic jumped 176% in users and 147% in page views over the 9 months ending November 30, 2021, compared to the same period ending November 30, 2020 (periods during which we spent $0 on LoseTheAgent.com advertising and marketing). We monetize the website by charging fees for both listing a home for sale and picking up possible buyers’ messages of interest. We also plan on generating additional revenues by monetizing seller/buyer data with targeted, interested parties. The web site is fully functional and is being marketed via various online platforms.
Going Concern
As a result of our financial condition, management has indicated in a footnote to our financial statements as of November 30, 2021 their uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, we must effectively balance many factors and begin to generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations. If we are not able to do this, we may not be able to continue as an operating company. At our current revenue and burn rate, our cash on hand will not cover our operating expenses for the next twelve months. There is no assurance that our existing cash flow will ever be adequate to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended November 30, 2021, compared to Year Ended November 30, 2020
Revenue
Total revenue for the year ended November 30, 2021, was $61,050 compared to $73,374 for the year ended November 30, 2020, a decrease of 16%. The decrease is primarily a result of declining legacy virtual tour business.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenues totaled $16,942 for year ended November 30, 2021, compared to $39,587 for the year ended November 30, 2020, representing a decrease of $22,645 or 57%. Cost of revenues consists primarily of engineering and server costs incurred in connection with maintenance of our online networks. The decline in costs is primarily due to a reduction in server costs.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses, which include salaries and benefits, selling and promotion, amortization and depreciation and general and administrative expenses, decreased 26% to $84,258, for the year ended November 30, 2021, compared to $113,842 for the year ended November 30, 2020, a decrease of $29,584. The decrease was substantially due to a decrease in salary and benefit expense of $23,327, decreases in selling and promotional expense of $17,020 and an increase of general and administrative expenses of $10,762 A breakdown of general and administrative expenses is as follows:
Other Income (Expenses)
During the current year, we obtained forgiveness of our PPP # 1 loan in the amount of $13,080 from the SBA. During the year ended November 30, 2020, we repurchased our convertible promissory notes for their holders at a discount to the principle and accrued interest owed and recognized a gain on those transactions.
Net Income/Loss
We had net loss of $27,070 for the year ended November 30, 2021, compared to a net loss of $69,617 for the year ended November 30, 2020, for a decrease of $42,547.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
Our principal needs for liquidity have been to fund operating losses and working capital requirements. Our principal source of liquidity as of November 30, 2021, consisted of cash of $19,622. We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be our principal need for liquidity over the near term. Working capital requirements are expected to increase as a result of our anticipated growth.
We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations. Management’s plan to meet our operating expenses in the short term is through equity and/or debt financing.
Cash Requirements
On November 30, 2021, we had $19,622 cash on-hand, an increase of $15,498 from the prior year balance of $4,124. Based on our current revenues, cash on hand, and our current net monthly burn rate of approximately $5,000 we will need to continue to raise money from the issuance of equity to fund short term operations.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operations
Net cash used by operating activities was $44,682 for the year ended November 30, 2021, a decrease of $41,889 from $86,571 used in operating activities in the year ended November 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the net loss from the year.
Investments
There were no investing activities for the years ended November 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Financing
Net cash provided by financing activities was $60,180 for the year ended November 30, 2021, as compared to net cash used by financing activities of $172,420 for the year ended November 30, 2020.

As of November 30, 2021, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources that are material to investors.
