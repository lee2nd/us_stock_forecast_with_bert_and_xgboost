ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following MD&A describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations and critical accounting estimates. This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
OVERVIEW
Ryder is a leading logistics and transportation company. Our operating segments are aggregated into reportable business segments based upon similar economic characteristics, products, services, customers and delivery methods. We report our financial performance based on three business segments: (1) Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), which provides full service leasing and leasing with flexible maintenance options, commercial rental, and maintenance services of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the United States (U.S.), Canada and the United Kingdom (U.K.); (2) Supply Chain Solutions (SCS), which provides integrated logistics solutions, including distribution management, dedicated transportation, transportation management, last mile and professional services in North America; and (3) Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS), which provides turnkey transportation solutions in the U.S. that includes dedicated vehicles, drivers, management and administrative support. Dedicated transportation services provided as part of an operationally integrated, multi-service, supply chain solution to SCS customers are primarily reported in the SCS business segment.
The FMS business, our largest segment, had total revenue and assets in 2020 of $5.2 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, representing 55% of our consolidated revenue (excluding eliminations) and 87% of consolidated assets. SCS total revenue and assets in 2020 were $2.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, representing 30% of our consolidated revenue and 10% of consolidated assets. DTS total revenue and assets in 2020 were $1.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, representing 15% of our consolidated revenue and 2% of consolidated assets. In 2020, we have revised our definition of operating revenue to exclude revenue related to liability insurance coverage for ChoiceLease customers as we announced our plan to exit this product line in early 2020. Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to current year presentation.
We operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves or may choose to obtain similar services from other third-party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including food and beverage service (22%), transportation and logistics (21%), retail and consumer goods (11%), automotive (10%), industrial (8%), housing (7%), technology (6%), business and personal services (5%) and other (10%).
Our results of operations and financial condition are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: used vehicle sales; macroeconomic and other market conditions, including pricing and demand; customer contracting activity and retention; rental demand; maintenance costs; residual value estimates and other depreciation changes; currency exchange rate fluctuations; customer preferences; inflation; fuel and energy prices; general economic conditions; insurance costs; interest rates; labor costs; unemployment; tax rates; changes in accounting or regulatory requirements; and cybersecurity attacks. This MD&A includes certain forward-looking statements regarding our 2021 outlook. These statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed.
Additionally, in 2020, our business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. For a detailed discussion of its impact on our results of operations, financial condition and future considerations, refer to our "Consolidated Results" and "Operating Results by Business Segment" discussions below and Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, for a detailed description of certain risk factors that impact our business, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to “Item 1A - Risk Factors” and "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" sections included in this Annual Report.
This MD&A includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this MD&A for information on these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and the reasons why we believe each measure is useful to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)
EBT and comparable EBT decreased primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $75 million related to prior residual value estimate changes. EBT and comparable EBT in 2020 also included negative estimated impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic of approximately $70 million in the first half of 2020, which was net of temporary cost savings of approximately $35 million, offset by improved ChoiceLease results in FMS and operating performance in SCS.
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted several areas of our businesses. In our FMS business segment, we experienced lower demand for commercial rental and declines in the used vehicle market through the second quarter (refer to Note 5, "Revenue Earning Equipment, net," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on residual value estimate changes in the first half of 2020 and trends related to used vehicle sales). During the second half of 2020, we started to experience a steady recovery in these areas as compared to the second quarter. In our SCS business segment, we experienced a deterioration in customer activity during the first half of 2020, primarily due to the temporary shutdowns in the automotive industry, which restarted their operations during the second quarter and are generally operating at normal levels. In addition, we experienced a slowdown in our sales growth opportunities in all of our businesses primarily through the third quarter. We established additional credit loss reserves during the year due to our expectations for COVID-19-related payment activity as a result of increased bankruptcies or insolvencies, or a delay in payments. We have attempted to mitigate the adverse impacts from the pandemic through cost reduction measures, including lower discretionary and overhead spending, and a reduction in capital expenditures, as well as temporary employee furloughs which primarily occurred in the second quarter. In addition, we took actions to reduce headcount at the end of the second quarter, primarily in our North American and U.K. FMS operations.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, provides for an acceleration of alternative minimum tax credit refunds, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes, the availability of an employee retention credit, and expands the availability of net operating loss usage. In addition, other governments in state, local and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also enacted certain relief measures. We continue to monitor new and updated legislation, however the provisions enacted have not had a material impact on our financial statements or liquidity position.
While we are experiencing positive momentum in the second half of 2020, any further negative effects of the pandemic may have an impact on our business and financial results, as well as on significant judgments and estimates, including those related to goodwill and other asset impairments, residual values and other depreciation assumptions, deferred income taxes and annual effective tax rates, variable revenue considerations, the valuation of our pension plans, and allowance for credit losses.
Cash provided by operating activities increased reflecting slightly lower working capital needs in 2020. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased primarily due to lower capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures decreased in 2020 reflecting lower investments in the ChoiceLease and rental fleets as a result of reduced sales activity and rental demand.
As of December 31, 2020, our debt balance decreased 17% from the prior year to $6.6 billion reflecting a decrease in capital spending, as well as the early redemption of two medium-term notes.
Adjusted return on equity (ROE) was (1.3)% and 0.3% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our interim target is 11% and long-term target over the cycle is 15%. The diminishing impact from the 2019 and 2020 residual value estimate changes and rental recovery are expected to contribute substantially to improving ROE in addition to other return improvement initiatives.

FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Lease & Related Maintenance and Rental
Change
2020 2019 2018 2020/2019 2019/2018
(In thousands)
Lease & related maintenance and rental revenues
$ 3,704,045 $ 3,784,744 $ 3,512,867 (2)% 8%
Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental
3,108,766 3,103,703 2,555,358 -% 21%
Gross margin $ 595,279 $ 681,041 $ 957,509 (13)% (29)%
Gross margin % 16% 18% 27%
Lease & related maintenance and rental revenues represent ChoiceLease and commercial rental product offerings within our FMS business segment. Revenues decreased 2% in 2020 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue, partially offset by higher ChoiceLease revenue. The decline in commercial rental revenue was due to reduced demand, including impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. ChoiceLease revenue in 2020 benefited from higher pricing as well as average active fleet growth.
Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental represents the direct costs related to lease & related maintenance and rental revenues and are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing, which are reported within "Interest expense" in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental remained flat in 2020 due to higher depreciation expense from residual value estimate changes in the first half of 2020 and 2019, offset by lower maintenance and other costs due to less activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our maintenance cost savings initiatives. Refer to "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 5, "Revenue Earning Equipment, net" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the residual value estimate changes in 2020, which primarily impacted our FMS business segment.
Lease & related maintenance and rental gross margin decreased 13% and gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of our prior residual value estimate changes and lower commercial rental revenue and utilization.
Services
Change
2020 2019 2018 2020/2019 2019/2018
(In thousands)
Services revenue $ 4,317,992 $ 4,555,692 $ 4,280,834 (5)% 6%
Cost of services 3,653,088 3,879,863 3,663,348 (6)% 6%
Gross margin $ 664,904 $ 675,829 $ 617,486 (2)% 9%
Gross margin % 15% 15% 14%
Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our SCS and DTS business segments, as well as SelectCare and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue decreased 5% in 2020, primarily driven by temporary production shutdowns due to COVID-19 in our automotive vertical in SCS in the second quarter, lower subcontracted transportation revenues and lower sales in DTS. These decreases were partially offset by new business and higher pricing in SCS.
Cost of services represents the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee-related costs, subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties), fuel, vehicle liability costs and maintenance costs. Cost of services decreased 6% in 2020, primarily due to lower activity related to COVID-19 in SCS and DTS and lower sales in DTS, as well as lower favorable insurance claim developments in 2020.
Services gross margin decreased 2% in 2020. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained consistent with 2019.

Fuel
Change
2020 2019 2018 2020/2019 2019/2018
(In thousands)
Fuel services revenue $ 398,054 $ 585,365 $ 620,245 (32)% (6)%
Cost of fuel services 382,749 571,658 605,613 (33)% (6)%
Gross margin $ 15,305 $ 13,707 $ 14,632 12% (6)%
Gross margin % 4% 2% 2%
Fuel services revenue represents fuel services provided to our FMS customers. Fuel services revenue decreased 32% in 2020 primarily reflecting lower fuel costs passed through to customers and lower gallons sold as a result of COVID-19.
Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee-related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel services decreased 33% in 2020 as a result of lower fuel costs and lower gallons sold.
Fuel services gross margin increased 12% in 2020. Fuel services gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 4% in 2020. Fuel is largely a pass-through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel is established based on trailing market fuel costs. Fuel services gross margin was impacted by these price change dynamics, including the impacts of COVID-19, as fuel prices fluctuated during the period.
Other operating expenses
Change
2020 2019 2018 2020/2019 2019/2018
(In thousands)
Other operating expenses $ 123,420 $ 121,980 $ 123,964 1% (2)%
Other operating expenses include costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment, such as facility depreciation, rent, purchased insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our ChoiceLease, commercial rental, and SelectCare customers. Other operating expenses remained consistent with 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Change
2020 2019 2018 2020/2019 2019/2018
(In thousands)
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)
$ 921,573 $ 907,449 $ 849,410 2% 7%
Percentage of total revenue 11% 10% 10%
SG&A expenses increased 2% in 2020. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by higher compensation related expenses, including a one-time, special recognition and retention bonus of approximately $28 million for our front-line non-incentive compensation plan eligible employees in recognition of the work performed during the pandemic, and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by cost savings related to temporary employee furloughs that occurred primarily in the second quarter and lower travel expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained relatively flat at 11% in 2020.

Non-operating pension costs
Change
2020 2019 2018 2020/2019 2019/2018
(In thousands)
Non-operating pension costs
$ 11,167 $ 60,406 $ 7,541 (82)% NM
Non-operating pension costs includes the components of our net periodic benefit cost other than service cost. These components include interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial loss and prior service cost, as well as settlement or curtailment charges. Non-operating pension costs decreased by $49 million in 2020 due to a pension settlement charge of $32 million related to employee benefit settlements from the U.S. pension plan recorded in 2019, favorable asset returns in 2019 and a decrease in interest rates. This decrease was offset by a curtailment loss of $9 million recognized in the second half of 2020 as a result of a freeze of substantially all of the remaining active participants in our pension plans.
Used vehicle sales, net
Change
2020 2019 2018 2020/2019 2019/2018
(In thousands)
(Gains) losses on used vehicle sales, net $ (414) $ 58,706 $ 22,325 NM NM
Used vehicle sales, net includes gains and losses from sales of used vehicles, selling costs associated with used vehicles and write-downs of vehicles held for sale to fair market value (referred to as "valuation adjustments"). Losses on used vehicle sales, net decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower valuation adjustments and higher gains on sales of used vehicles as compared to the prior year.
Average proceeds per unit in 2020 for tractors decreased from the prior year reflecting higher sales volumes in the wholesale markets, which generally has lower proceeds per unit, and lower retail pricing as compared to the prior year. Average proceeds per unit for trucks increased from the prior year reflecting higher retail pricing as compared to the prior year. The following table presents the used vehicle proceeds per unit change compared with the prior year:
Proceeds per unit change (1)

Effective interest rate 3.6% 3.3% 3.0%
Interest expense increased 8% to $261 million in 2020 primarily reflecting higher average outstanding debt, including a higher portion of fixed rate debt, and prepayment penalties of $9 million related to two medium-term notes originally maturing in 2021. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects higher vehicle capital spending in 2019 and additional borrowings under our trade receivable program and global revolving credit facility in the first half of 2020.

(1)Non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this MD&A for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue and segment total revenue to segment operating revenue for FMS, SCS and DTS, as well as the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors.
(2)Refer to Note 20, "Other Items Impacting Comparability," and below for a discussion of items excluded from our primary measure of segment performance.
As part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as "Earnings from continuing operations before taxes" (EBT), which includes an allocation of costs from Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes non-operating pension costs and certain other items as discussed in Note 20, “Other Items Impacting Comparability,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including finance and procurement, corporate services, human resources, information technology, public affairs, legal, marketing and corporate communications. To be consistent with current year management presentation, certain costs within CSS were reclassified in 2019 and 2018.
The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS, including costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. Refer to Note 23, “Segment Reporting,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the methodology for allocating the remainder of CSS costs to the business segments.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment, as well as provides rental vehicles, fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to the SCS and DTS segments. EBT related to inter-segment equipment and services billed to SCS and DTS customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the segment that served the customer and then eliminated upon consolidation (presented as “Eliminations”). Inter-segment EBT allocated to SCS and DTS includes earnings related to equipment used in providing services to SCS and DTS customers. Refer to Note 23, "Segment Reporting" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(1)Non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of FMS total revenue to FMS operating revenue, as well as the reasons why management believes this measure is important to investors, is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this MD&A.
FMS total revenue decreased 7% to $5.2 billion in 2020 primarily due to lower fuel services and commercial rental revenues, partially offset by higher ChoiceLease revenue. FMS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and ChoiceLease liability insurance revenues) decreased 3% to $4.6 billion in 2020 primarily from a decline in commercial rental as demand was impacted from COVID-19, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by higher pricing in ChoiceLease. ChoiceLease revenue increased 3% in 2020 primarily due to higher prices on vehicles partially offset by lower revenue based on mileage. ChoiceLease revenue also increased due to a higher average active fleet size. SelectCare revenue decreased 5% in 2020 due to lower volumes. Commercial rental revenue decreased 17% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand (see further discussion below). Commercial rental revenue included an estimated negative impact in the first half of 2020 from COVID-19 of approximately $70 million. Fuel services revenue decreased 30% in 2020 primarily reflecting lower fuel costs passed through to customers and lower gallons sold.

(4)Excluding trailers.
FMS EBT decreased in 2020 primarily due to higher depreciation expense impacts from prior residual value estimate changes, which resulted in a negative year-over-year EBT impact of $75 million. In the first half of 2020, we performed a review of the estimated residual values of our FMS revenue earning equipment for both accelerated and policy depreciation primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on current and expected used vehicle market conditions, including our expectation on a delayed recovery in the used vehicle market beyond our previous expectation of mid-2021. We expect the negative impact from the prior residual value estimate changes to continue to decline going forward. Refer to "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 5, "Revenue Earning Equipment, net" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
EBT in 2020 was also negatively impacted by lower rental demand, including an estimated impact of approximately $70 million attributed to COVID-19 in the first half of 2020. Rental power fleet utilization decreased to 67.4% in 2020 from 75.0% in 2019, on a 13% smaller average rental power fleet, as noted in the table above. Since the end of the first quarter, commercial rental demand has been negatively impacted by COVID-19 as demand for commercial rental vehicles was significantly impacted in the second quarter due to a substantial reduction in business activity. We took actions to reduce the rental fleet size, and redeploy rental vehicles to fulfill new lease contracts and support the SCS and DTS segments. Utilization has increased throughout the second half of the year due to improving economic conditions and these actions taken to reduce and redeploy the rental fleet size. These negative impacts were partially offset by improved lease results in 2020 primarily due to higher prices on vehicles and the benefit from the discontinuation of the ChoiceLease liability insurance program. The results of the ChoiceLease liability insurance program are no longer reflected in the FMS results and are now reported in "Other Items Impacting Comparability" starting in 2020. Results also reflect lower maintenance costs, including benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. In addition, we also benefited from COVID-19 related cost actions, including lower travel expenses, reduced headcount and temporary employee furloughs.

NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2020, the number of NLE units decreased 39% reflecting a lower number of units held for sale as well as lower number of units being prepared for sale or redeployment.

(1)Non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of SCS total revenue to SCS operating revenue, as well as the reasons why management believes this measure is important to investors is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this MD&A.
SCS total revenue remained flat and SCS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation revenues) decreased 1% in 2020 primarily due to lower activity in our automotive vertical as a result of production shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by new business in several verticals, increased pricing and higher volumes. Revenue in 2020 included estimated negative COVID-19 related impacts of approximately $70 million in the first half of 2020, primarily due to shutdowns in our automotive vertical. In the second quarter, our automotive customers resumed production and are generally at normal operating levels. We expect revenue growth in line with high single digits range.
SCS EBT increased 10% in 2020 due to higher pricing, improved operating performance and new business, partially offset by estimated impacts of COVID-19 of approximately $35 million in the first half of 2020, particularly due to the temporary shutdowns in our automotive vertical. In addition, EBT was impacted by lower favorable insurance claim developments and a decrease in equipment contribution of $5 million in 2020 (see further discussions on equipment contribution above).

Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $2.2 billion in 2020 compared with $2.1 billion in 2019 reflecting slightly lower working capital needs in 2020. Our changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect the timing of collections of our receivables and payments of our trade payables, as well as other changes in operating assets and liabilities. The unfavorable impact in receivables was primarily due to lower revenues as a result of COVID-19 partially offset by the extension of credit terms for certain customers. The favorable impact from trade payables was primarily due to lower spend. In addition, the favorable impact from changes in other assets and liabilities was driven by the deferral of certain payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, lower compensation-related payments and a decrease in inventories in 2020. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $0.6 billion in 2020 compared with $3.2 billion in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures as a result of lower ChoiceLease sales and rental activity. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased to a use of ($1.5) billion in 2020 compared with proceeds of $1.1 billion in 2019 due to increased debt repayments and lower debt borrowings.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)
Free cash flow increased to $1.6 billion in 2020 from negative $1.1 billion in 2019 primarily due to lower capital expenditures.
Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations will remain consistent at approximately $2.2 billion in 2021. We expect free cash flow to decrease to approximately $400 - $700 million reflecting higher capital spending related to the use of new equipment to fulfill lease contracts and the replacement and growth of the rental fleet.
Purchase Obligations
The majority of our purchase obligations are pay-as-you-go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Accounts payable” and “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities.” In addition, we reflect obligations with settlements that are greater than twelve months from December 31, 2020 as "Other non-current liabilities", including operating lease liabilities. The most significant purchase obligations relate to the purchase of revenue earning equipment, which can generally be cancelled 60 days prior to when the vehicle starts being built by the original equipment manufacturer. See further discussion below on our capital expenditures. We believe that our operating cash flows and access to the debt markets, as further discussed in Financing and Other Funding Transactions below, are sufficient to all us to meet our contractual obligations.
Capital expenditures generally represent the purchase of revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the ChoiceLease and commercial rental product lines. The level of capital required to support the ChoiceLease product line varies based on customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over three to seven years for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. We utilize capital for the purchase of vehicles in our commercial rental product line to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment.

_______________
(1)Total capital expenditures exclude $14 million, $22 million and $15 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in assets held under finance leases resulting from new or the extension of existing finance leases and other additions.
Total capital expenditures decreased to $1.1 billion in 2020 reflecting lower investments in the ChoiceLease and rental fleets as a result of reduced sales activity and rental demand. In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cancelled or postponed vehicle orders in the second quarter where possible, which has significantly reduced capital expenditures during 2020. Later in the year, we began to reinstate some of the postponed vehicle orders, however we expect these vehicles to be delivered in 2021. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $2.0 to $2.3 billion in 2021 primarily due to the use of new equipment to fulfill lease contracts and the replacement and growth of the rental fleet.

Financing and Other Funding Transactions
We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset-based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long-term and medium-term public and private debt, asset-backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of unsecured commercial paper and medium-term notes.
Cash and equivalents totaled $151 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $62 million was held outside the U.S. and is available to fund operations and other growth of non-U.S. subsidiaries. If we decide to repatriate cash and equivalents held outside the U.S., we may be subject to additional income and withholding taxes. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund our U.S. operations.
We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to the public unsecured bond market, commercial paper market and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in the public unsecured bond market or the commercial paper market would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to public bonds, commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or by seeking other funding sources. In the second quarter of 2020, we amended our net worth covenant in our revolving credit facility and other debt instruments to enable more flexibility under the covenant. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we amended our revolving credit facility to address various administrative matters. Refer to Note 12, “Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our net worth covenant amendment and further discussion around the global revolving credit facility, the trade receivables program, issuance of medium-term notes under our shelf registration statement, asset-backed financing obligations and debt maturities.
Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is impacted by both our short-term and long-term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short-term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper and likely require us to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, assuming ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility.
Our debt ratings and rating outlooks as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:
Rating Summary
Short-term Short-term Outlook Long-term Long-term Outlook
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services A2 - BBB Stable
Moody’s Investors Service P2 Stable Baa2 Stable
Fitch Ratings - BBB+ Negative
DBRS R-1 (Low) Negative A (Low) Negative
As of December 31, 2020, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities:
(In millions)
Global revolving credit facility $1,123
Trade receivables program 300
In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to align the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our vehicle assets. We utilize both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to achieve this alignment and generally target a mix of 20% - 40% variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable-rate portion of our total debt (including notional value of swap agreements) was 9% and 17% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in variable-rate debt is largely due to the reduction of short-term variable rate debt.
Our debt to equity ratios were 293% and 320% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The debt to equity ratio represents total debt divided by total equity. The decrease in debt-to-equity from year-end 2019 primarily reflects the reduction in debt due to higher free cash flow.

Guarantees. Refer to Note 13, “Guarantees,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees.
Pension Information
Refer to Note 18, “Employee Benefit Plans,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for background and further information regarding our company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans. During 2020, total global pension contributions were $136 million, which included $98 million of prefunding contributions for our U.S. pension plan for 2021 through 2023, compared with $72 million in 2019. We estimate 2021 required pension contributions will be $7 million related to our foreign pension plans. The present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $33 million (pre-tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after-tax) of $655 million and $667 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The improvement in funded status reflects the benefit of asset returns of 13% in 2020 and higher level of pension contributions, partially offset by a decrease in discount rates.
We also participate in certain U.S. multi-employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our MEP plan contributions in 2020 was $11 million.
We expect 2021 pension expense to decrease to approximately $12 million since the remaining active participants were frozen as of December 31, 2020 and the non-recurring curtailment charges recorded in 2020. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension Plans” section for further discussion on pension accounting estimates.
Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends
Refer to Note 14, “Share Repurchase Programs,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs.
Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $119 million in 2020 and $116 million in 2019. In 2020 and 2019, our annualized dividend was $2.24 and $2.20 per share of common stock, respectively.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

Market Risk
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed-rate and variable-rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. The fair value of derivatives was not material as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $5.3 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding (excluding finance leases and U.S. asset- backed securities) with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.43% and a fair value of $5.7 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $15 million as of December 31, 2020. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $616 million of variable-rate debt, including $150 million of fixed-rate debt instruments swapped to LIBOR-based floating-rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2020 was $621 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would not have impacted 2020 pre-tax earnings by a material amount.
We are also subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized on an annual basis.
Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations’ buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations’ buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would not materially impact the results of operations. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the foreign currency exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we have no near-term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries.
Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2020, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Changes in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryder’s Audit Committee on an annual basis.
The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical.
Depreciation and Residual Value Estimates. Depreciation on the vehicles in our fleet is determined at the time of acquisition and is recognized over a vehicle's useful life to its estimated residual value (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of vehicles) to attempt to minimize gains or losses upon sale in the used vehicle market.
We periodically review and adjust, as appropriate, the estimated residual values and useful lives of existing revenue earning equipment for the purposes of recording depreciation expense as described in Note 5, “Revenue Earning Equipment, Net" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on the results of our analysis, we may adjust the estimated residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment each year. Reductions in estimated residual values or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the vehicle. Our review of the estimated residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment is established with a long-term view, which we refer to as "policy depreciation," based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage, as well as other factors. These other factors include, but are not limited to, historical market prices, current and expected future market prices, expected lives of vehicles, and expected sales of used vehicles in the wholesale and retail markets. We also assess estimates of residual values of vehicles expected to be made available for sale in the near-term (generally 12 to 24 months) based on near-term market rates and conditions and may adjust residual values for these vehicles, which we refer to as “accelerated depreciation.” As disclosed in Note 5, "Revenue Earning Equipment, Net," we reviewed and revised our estimated residual values in the third quarter of 2019, and again, in the first half of 2020 largely due to impacts from COVID-19. The nature of these estimate changes and the impact to earnings are disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the policy depreciation estimate change in the second quarter of 2020 as a percentage of our original vehicle investment was approximately 3%. We have not made any significant changes to our residual value estimates since the second quarter of 2020.
The approximate unfavorable incremental impact on the annual depreciation expense resulting from prior residual value change in estimates was as follows (rounded to the closest million):
Years ended December 31,
2021 (1)
2020 2019
(in thousands)
Accelerated depreciation (2)

_______________
(1)Excludes forecasted gains or losses on used vehicle sales.
(2)Excludes net gains of $0.4 million in 2020 and net losses of $59 million in 2019 for used vehicle sales results.
Our accelerated depreciation residual value levels for both tractors and trucks, which include the impact of COVID-19, are currently below our average annual used vehicle pricing for each year in the last 20 years. These average annual used vehicle pricing levels are calculated based on used vehicle prices as a percentage of our original vehicle investment (cost).
Policy Depreciation Sensitivity
Based on our fleet of revenue earning equipment as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical additional 10% reduction in estimated residual values as a percentage of original vehicle investment used for policy depreciation would increase depreciation expense over the remaining life of these vehicles by approximately $280 million. Our average annual used vehicle pricing as a percentage of our original vehicle investment has been above our current policy depreciation residual value levels for trucks 19 out of the last 20 years and for tractors 17 out of the last 20 years.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)
While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales or revisions to residual value estimates. While management believes that current estimates are reasonable given our current outlook, if our tractor used vehicle sales pricing as a percentage of our original vehicle investment does not improve, we will likely be required to lower residual value estimates even further which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in supply and demand; changes in technology; competitor pricing; regulatory requirements; driver shortages, requirements and preferences; and changes in underlying assumption factors. As a result, future residual value estimates and resulting depreciation expense are subject to change based upon changes in these factors.
Revenue Recognition. We generate revenue primarily through contracts with customers to lease, rent and maintain revenue earning equipment and to provide logistics management and dedicated transportation services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectibility of consideration is probable. We recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform because of continuous transfer of control to our customers.
We offer a full service lease as well as a lease with more flexible maintenance options under our ChoiceLease product line in our FMS business segment, which are marketed, priced and managed as bundled products that include the equipment lease, maintenance and other related services. We do not offer a stand-alone lease of new vehicles. Our ChoiceLease product line includes the lease of a vehicle (lease component) and maintenance and other services (non-lease component). Contract consideration is allocated between the lease and non-lease components based on management's best estimate of the relative stand-alone selling price of each component. Allocating consideration between the lease and maintenance components in our ChoiceLease product requires significant judgment. We do not sell the components of our ChoiceLease product offering on a stand-alone basis, therefore significant judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices of the lease and maintenance components in order to allocate the consideration on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.
For the lease component, we estimate the stand-alone selling price using the projected cash outflows related to the underlying leased vehicle, net of the estimated disposal proceeds, and a certain targeted return considering the weighted average cost of capital. For the non-lease component of the contract, we estimate the stand-alone selling price of the maintenance component using an expected cost-plus margin approach. The expected costs are based on our historical costs of providing maintenance services in our ChoiceLease arrangements. The margin is based on the historical margin percentages for our full service maintenance contracts in the SelectCare product line, as the maintenance performance obligation in those contracts is similar to maintenance in our ChoiceLease arrangements. Full service maintenance arrangements in SelectCare are priced based on targeted margin percentages for new and used vehicles by type of vehicle (trucks, tractors, and trailers), considering the fixed and variable costs of providing maintenance services.
We recognize maintenance revenue using an input method, consistent with the estimated pattern of the costs to maintain the underlying vehicles. This generally results in the recognition of a contract liability for the portion of the customer's billings allocated to the maintenance service component of the agreement. The non-lease revenue component for maintenance included in "Lease & related maintenance and rental revenues" was $965 million, $950 million and $909 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The stand-alone price for both the lease and non-lease components could vary in the future based on both external market conditions and our pricing strategies as a result of the market conditions.
Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event, such as a curtailment, requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our annual measurement date at December 31. In order to estimate the
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)
discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long-term rate of return assumptions are based on a review of our asset allocation strategy and long-term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions.
Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments participants may receive over their lifetime, and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize. We update our mortality assumptions as deemed necessary by taking into consideration relevant actuarial studies as they become available as well as reassessing our own historical experience.
As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. Our U.S. pension investment policy and strategy seek to reduce the effects of future volatility on the fair value of our pension assets relative to our pension liabilities by increasing our allocation of high quality, longer-term fixed income securities and reducing our allocation of equity investments as the funded status of the plan improves. The composition of our pension assets was 33% equity securities and alternative assets and 67% debt securities and other investments as of December 31, 2020. We continually evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. In 2021, we adjusted our long-term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan to 3.90% from 5.05% based on our expected asset mix which has a higher proportion of debt securities.
Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” We had a pre-tax accumulated actuarial loss of $855 million and $870 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. To the extent the amount of cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or plan assets, the excess amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2021 and future years is $604 million. We expect to recognize approximately $28 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2021. The effect on years beyond 2021 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans in future years.
Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2020 net pension expense is presented in Note 18, “Employee Benefit Plans,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below:
Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2021 Net Pension Expense Effect on December 31, 2020 Projected Benefit Obligation
Expected long-term rate of return on assets 3.90% +/- 0.25 +/- $4 million N/A
Discount rate 2.60% + 0.25 N/M - $56 million
Discount rate 2.60% - 0.25 N/M + $59 million
Self-Insurance Accruals. Self-insurance accruals were $444 million and $411 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of our self-insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers’ compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns, and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During both 2020 and 2019, we recognized charges of $18 million from the development of estimated prior years’ self-insured loss reserves. Based on self-insurance accruals at December 31, 2020, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2021 by approximately $22 million.

Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. As of December 31, 2020, total goodwill was $475 million. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we are required to assess the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to its carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance.
We assess goodwill for impairment on October 1st of each year or more often if deemed necessary. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary, such as macroeconomic conditions, changes in our industry and the markets in which we operate, and our market capitalization as well as our reporting units' historical and expected future financial performance. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value or we bypass the optional qualitative assessment, recoverability is assessed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we will measure any goodwill impairment losses as the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
For quantitative tests, we estimated the fair value of the reporting units using a combination of both a market and income approach. We perform our quantitative impairment test with the assistance of a third-party specialist. Under the market approach, we use a selection of comparable publicly-traded companies that correspond to the reporting unit to derive a market-based multiple. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the discounted present value of the projected future cash flows. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure, adjusted for equity and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and significant judgments and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including revenue growth rates, margins, long-term growth rates, capital requirements, proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the ability to utilize our tax net operating losses, and the discount rate. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS and DTS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to our SCS or DTS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss.
In making our assessments of fair value, we rely on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist in the future. These assumptions are based on a number of factors, including future operating performance, economic conditions, actions we expect to take and present value techniques. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future. We conduct additional sensitivity analyses to assess the risk for potential impairment based upon changes in the key assumptions in our goodwill valuation test, including long-term growth rates and discount rates.
As further discussed in Note 7, “Goodwill,” we performed an interim impairment test of our FMS North America reporting unit (FMS NA) in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the decline in market conditions and our updated outlook as a result of the impact of COVID-19. Our valuation of fair value for FMS NA was determined based on a discounted future cash flow model (income approach) and the application of current market multiples for comparable publicly-traded companies (market approach). Based on our analysis, we determined that FMS NA goodwill was not impaired as of March 31, 2020. The estimated fair value of the FMS NA reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5% as of March 31, 2020.
Given this level of fair value, in the event the financial performance of FMS NA does not meet our expectations in the future; we experience future prolonged market downturns, including in the used vehicle market or sustained declines in our stock price; worsening trends from the COVID-19 pandemic; or there are other negative revisions to key assumptions, we may be required to perform additional impairment analyses and could be required to recognize a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. As of December 31, 2020, FMS NA goodwill was $244 million. We determined that there have not been any interim impairment trigger events since the first quarter of 2020.
On October 1, 2020, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units and conducted a qualitative analysis based on market conditions, business performance and our stock price. Based on this analysis, we determined that the fair values more likely than not exceeded their respective carrying values for each reporting unit.

Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities.
Tax regulations can require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements can be different than that reported in the tax return. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years, for which we have already recognized the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets were $814 million and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recognize a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the deferred tax valuation allowance was $41 million and $18 million, respectively. Refer to Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the valuation allowance that was recorded in 2020 related to our U.K. deferred tax assets. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on management’s expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made.
As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. We accrue the largest amount of the benefit that has a cumulative probability of greater than 50% of being sustained. These accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years exposed to audit due to open statutes varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position has been determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained, (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statutes of limitations for the tax position has expired. Refer to Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

NON-GAAP AND SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information that is not required by U.S. GAAP to be presented in the financial statements. Certain elements of this information are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined by SEC rules. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to financial measures used by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in this non-GAAP financial measures section or in the MD&A above. We also provide the reasons why management believes each non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in this section.
Specifically, we refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K:

◦Volatility in customer volumes and shifting customer demand in the industries serviced by our SCS business.
◦Changes in current financial, tax or regulatory requirements that could negatively impact our financial results.
•Competition:
◦Advances in technology may impact demand for our services or may require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments.
◦Competition from other service providers, some of which have greater capital resources or lower capital costs, or from our customers, who may choose to provide services themselves.
◦Continued consolidation in the markets in which we operate which may create large competitors with greater financial resources.
◦Our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to economic conditions, demand for services, customer acceptance or competition.
•Profitability:
◦Our inability to obtain adequate profit margins for our services.
◦Lower than expected sales volumes or customer retention levels.
