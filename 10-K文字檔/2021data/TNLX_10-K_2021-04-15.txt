ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Trans-Lux is a leading supplier of LED technology for display applications. The essential elements of these systems are the real-time, programmable digital products that we design, manufacture, distribute and service. Designed to meet the digital signage solutions for any size venue’s indoor and outdoor needs, these displays are used primarily in applications for the financial, banking, gaming, corporate, advertising, transportation, entertainment and sports markets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: Digital product sales and Digital product lease and maintenance.
The Digital product sales segment includes worldwide revenues and related expenses from the sales of both indoor and outdoor digital product signage. This segment includes the financial, government/private, gaming, scoreboards and outdoor advertising markets. The Digital product lease and maintenance segment includes worldwide revenues and related expenses from the lease and maintenance of both indoor and outdoor digital product signage. This segment includes the lease and maintenance of digital product signage across all markets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable, slow-moving and obsolete inventories, rental equipment, goodwill, income taxes, warranty reserve, warrants, pension plan obligations, contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements:
Uncollectible Accounts Receivable: The Company maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Should non-payment by customers differ from the Company’s estimates, a revision to increase or decrease the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable may be required.
Slow-Moving and Obsolete Inventories: The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the carrying value of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
Rental Equipment: The Company evaluates rental equipment assets for possible impairment annually to determine if the $656,000 carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company uses a cash flow model to determine the fair value under the income approach, based on the remaining lengths of existing leases. Changes in the assumptions used could materially impact our fair value estimates. Assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are projected renewal rates and CPI rate changes. These and other assumptions are impacted by national and global economic conditions including changes in national and international interest rates, taxes, inflation, etc. and will change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. The December 31, 2020 impairment analysis included a renewal rate estimate of 92.1% and a CPI rate change of approximately 1.5%, which were the actual average rates for the two-year period ended December 31, 2020. Based on these assumptions, the cash flow model determined a fair value of $7.8 million, exceeding its carrying value by 1087%. Therefore there is no impairment of the Rental Equipment. For every 1-percentage-point change in the renewal rate, the valuation would change by approximately $182,000. For every 0.1-percentage-point change in the CPI rate, the valuation would change by approximately $16,000.
Rental equipment is comprised of installed digital products on lease primarily used for indoor trading applications, time and temperature displays and other digital message displays and have estimated useful lives of 10-15 years. For example, the Company is party to contracts for equipment originally installed over 30 or 40 years ago in the 1970’s and 1980’s, as well as dozens of installations from the 1990’s still in operation. Current contracts have an average age of 21.0 years from their installation dates through the expiration of their current terms.
Goodwill: The Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company had $744,000 of goodwill related to its digital product sales reporting unit. The Company used the income and the market approach to test for impairment of its goodwill, and considers other factors including economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. The Company weighed these approaches by using a 90% factor for the income approach and a 10% factor for the market approach. Together these two factors estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value under the income approach which contemplates an overall weighted average revenue growth rate. The Company used a market multiple approach based on revenue to determine the fair value under the market approach which includes a selection of and market price of a group of comparable companies and the performance of the guidelines of the comparable companies and of the reporting unit. The October 1, 2020 annual review indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit did not exceed the carrying value. Therefore, there was an impairment of goodwill related to our digital product sales reporting unit. As a result, the Company wrote off the $744,000 of goodwill in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Restricted Cash: The Company classifies cash as restricted when the cash is unavailable for withdrawal or usage for general operations. Restrictions may include legally restricted deposits, contracts entered into with others, or the Company’s statements of intention with regard to particular deposits. In May 2017, the Company deposited $650,000 in a savings account as collateral for a letter of credit in favor of the City of Hazelwood, Missouri as collateral for a forgivable loan. In July 2020, the loan was terminated and the restricted cash was used to pay off the loan in full.
In July 2016, the Company deposited $400,000 in a savings account as collateral for a letter of credit in favor of the landlord at its Hazelwood, Missouri manufacturing facility as a security deposit. In October 2017, the security deposit was reduced by $100,000 to $300,000, in October 2018, the security deposit was reduced by $50,000 to $250,000, and in October 2019, the security deposit was reduced by an additional $50,000 to $200,000, so the related letter of credit and savings account deposit were also reduced. Due to cash constraints in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the landlord allowed the Company to apply the security deposit against current rent payments, so the security deposit was reduced from $200,000 to zero. The Company has presented these funds in Restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets since the use of the funds under the letters of credit is restricted.
Income Taxes: The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
Warranty Reserve: The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. While the Company engages in product quality programs and processes, including evaluating the quality of the component suppliers, the warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates. Should actual product failure rates differ from the Company’s estimates, revisions to increase or decrease the estimated warranty liability may be required.
Pension Plan Obligations: The Company is required to make estimates and assumptions to determine the obligation of our pension benefit plan, which includes investment returns and discount rates. The Company recorded after-tax charges in unrecognized pension liability of $755,000 and $342,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, in other comprehensive loss. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed annually with the assistance of external actuarial professionals and adjusted as circumstances change. Assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of liability and expense we recognize. At December 31, 2020, plan assets were invested 31.8% in fixed income contracts and 68.2% in equity and index funds. The investment return assumption takes the asset mix into consideration. The assumed discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled. The Company utilizes a yield curve in lieu of a single weighted discount rate in determining liabilities and the interest cost for the following year. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average rates used for the computation of benefit plan liabilities were: investment returns, 8.00% and discount rate, 3.20%. The net periodic cost for 2021 will be based on the December 31, 2020 valuation. The defined benefit pension plan periodic benefit (cost) was $111,000 and ($83,000) in 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, assuming no change in the other assumptions, a one-percentage point increase/(decrease) in the discount rate would have increased/(decreased) the net periodic cost by $20,000/($32,000).
As of December 31, 2003, the benefit service under the defined benefit pension plan had been frozen and, accordingly, there is no service cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. In 2020, we made contributions of $85,000 of the plan. As allowed by the CARES Act, the Company elected to defer the payment of the $556,000 of remaining minimum required contributions due in 2020 until January 1, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company made $56,000 of contributions to the plan. At this time, we expect to make our remaining minimum required contributions in 2021 of $1.0 million; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to make any or all of such remaining payments. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Pension Plan for further details.
Contingencies and Litigation: The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business and/or which are covered by insurance. The Company has accrued reserves individually and in the aggregate for such legal proceedings. Should actual litigation results differ from the Company’s estimates, revisions to increase or decrease the accrued reserves may be required. There are no open matters that the Company deems material.
Results of Operations
The following table presents our Statements of Operations data, expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
2020 Compared to 2019
Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $7.6 million or 44.6% to $9.4 million from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in Digital product sales.
Digital product sales revenues decreased $7.3 million or 49.8% to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
Digital product lease and maintenance revenues decreased $258,000 or 11.1% to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the continued expected revenue decline in the older outdoor display equipment rental and maintenance bases acquired in the early 1990s. The financial services market continues to be negatively impacted by the current investment climate resulting in consolidation within that industry and the wider use of flat-panel screens for smaller applications.
Total operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $4.2 million to $4.6 million from $451,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, principally due to the decrease in revenues and an increase in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues.
Digital product sales operating income (loss) decreased $5.4 million to a loss of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to income of $183,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the decrease in revenues. The cost of Digital product sales decreased $2.7 million or 22.4%, primarily due to the decrease in revenues. The cost of Digital product sales represented 129.1% of related revenues in 2020 compared to 83.4% in 2019. General and administrative expenses for Digital product sales increased $768,000 or 34.1%, primarily due to the write-off of goodwill and an increase in marketing expenses, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expenses and employees’ expenses.
Digital product lease and maintenance operating income decreased $363,000 or 20.7% to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the cost of Digital product lease and maintenance and a decrease in general and administrative expenses. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance decreased $147,000 or 19.0%, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance revenues represented 30.4% of related revenues in 2020 compared to 33.3% in 2019. The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance includes field service expenses, plant repair costs, maintenance and depreciation. General and administrative expenses for Digital product lease and maintenance increased $252,000 to $50,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in bad debt expenses.
Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 million or 65.0% to $836,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in relocation, employee, rent, legal and directors’ expenses, partially offset by an increase in warrant expense.
Net interest expense decreased $79,000 or 15.7% to $425,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $504,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in interest rates and the average outstanding long-term debt, primarily due to the decrease in the balance owed under revolving credit loans and term loans, partially offset by the new borrowing under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan.
The gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented the reversal of accrued interest on the Hazelwood loan, which was terminated in July 2020. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented the write-off of the remaining debt discount costs and the termination fees related to the CNH and SM Investors loans, partially offset by the gain on the extinguishment of $35,000 of Notes.
The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was a benefit (expense) of 0.1% and (3.0%), respectively. In 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized income tax benefit (expense) of $7,000 and ($41,000), respectively. The income tax expense in 2020 and 2019 is affected by income tax expense related to the Company’s Canadian subsidiary and the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets as a result of reporting pre-tax losses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Current Liquidity
The Company has incurred recurring losses and continues to have a working capital deficiency. The Company incurred a net loss of $4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and had a working capital deficiency of $6.3 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $3.1 million. The increase in the working capital deficiency as compared to December 31, 2019 is primarily due to increases in the current portion of long-term debt, customer deposits and accounts payable, as well as decreases in receivables, cash, inventories and prepaids and other assets, partially offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities.
The Company is dependent on future operating performance in order to generate sufficient cash flows in order to continue to run its businesses. Future operating performance is dependent on general economic conditions, as well as financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In order to more effectively manage its cash resources, the Company had, from time to time, increased the timetable of its payment of some of its payables, which had, from time to time, delayed certain product deliveries from our vendors, which in turn had, from time to time, delayed certain deliveries to our customers. The recent cash infusions have resolved these previous issues.
Management believes there is substantial doubt as to whether we will have adequate liquidity, including access to the debt and equity capital markets, to operate our business over the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Form 10-K. The Company continually evaluates the need and availability of long-term capital to meet its cash requirements and fund potential new opportunities.
The Company used cash for operating activities of $1.9 million and $4.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has implemented several initiatives to improve operational results and cash flows over future periods, including reducing headcount, reorganizing its sales department and outsourcing certain administrative functions. The Company continues to explore ways to reduce operational and overhead costs. The Company periodically takes steps to reduce the cost to maintain the digital products on lease and maintenance agreements.
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased $1.3 million in 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of $1.9 million, the paydown of $650,000 on the Hazelwood loan and investments in equipment for rental, property and equipment of $190,000, partially offset by borrowing on the revolving loan of $612,000 and proceeds from the PPP loan of $811,000. The Company will apply for forgiveness of all or some of the PPP loan. The current economic environment has increased the Company’s trade receivables collection cycle, and its allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, but collections continue to be favorable.
Under various agreements, the Company is obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts. These include payments under the Company’s long-term debt agreements, payments to the Company’s pension plan, employment agreement payments, warranty liabilities and rental payments required under operating lease agreements. The Company has both variable and fixed interest rate debt. Interest payments are projected based on actual interest payments incurred in 2020 until the underlying debts mature.
The following table summarizes the Company’s fixed cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 over the next five fiscal years:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company still had outstanding $352,000 of Notes which matured as of March 1, 2012. The Company also still had outstanding $220,000 of Debentures which matured on December 1, 2012. On January 15, 2021, the Company agreed to an exchange with a holder of $50,000 of Notes, under which agreement the Company paid $20,000 to the holder in exchange for the principal and the holder forgive any accrued interest. The Company continues to consider future exchanges of the $302,000 of remaining Notes and $220,000 of remaining Debentures, but has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any further exchanges. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Long-Term Debt for further details.
The Company may still seek additional financing in order to provide enough cash to cover our remaining current fixed cash obligations as well as providing working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the amounts, if any, the Company will receive in any such financing or the terms thereof. The Company has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such financings. To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities, it could be dilutive to existing shareholders.
Pension Plan Contributions
The minimum required pension plan contribution for 2020 was $641,000, of which the Company contributed $85,000. As allowed by the CARES Act, the Company elected to defer the payment of the $556,000 of remaining minimum required contributions due in 2020 until January 1, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company made $56,000 of contributions to the pension benefit plan. At this time, we expect to make our minimum required contributions to the pension benefit plan in 2021 of $1.0 million; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to make any or all of such remaining payments. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Pension Plan for further details.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Company has no majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements nor does it have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose off-balance sheet financing entities.
