Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Data” section and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See “Forward-Looking Statements” at the end of this discussion and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion.
Overview
We are a leading independent global manufacturer of highly engineered equipment servicing multiple applications in the Energy and Industrial Gas markets. Our unique product portfolio is used in every phase of the liquid gas supply chain, including upfront engineering, service and repair. Being at the forefront of the clean energy transition, Chart is a leading provider of technology, equipment and services related to liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, biogas and CO2 Capture amongst other applications. We are committed to excellence in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues both for our company as well as our customers. With over 25 global locations from the United States to Asia, Australia, India, Europe and South America, we maintain accountability and transparency to our team members, suppliers, customers and communities.
Covid-19 Update
While the outbreak and continued uncertainty associated with the coronavirus (Covid-19) did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for 2020, we continue to actively monitor the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on our results of operations for 2021 and beyond. The extent to which our operations will be impacted by the outbreak will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity, or reemergence, of the outbreak and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, among other things.
In terms of macro drivers, Covid-19 has sparked an emphasis on health and clean energy transformation, in many cases, accelerating efforts and incenting governments to think through investments in renewable energy sources and storage, including hydrogen, carbon capture, biogas/biomethane and LNG. We continue to expand our footprint in these varied clean energy spaces as highlighted by our recent increased investments in hydrogen-related and emissions reductions businesses. Governments have been responding on a massive scale with stimulus packages, many of which are targeted to kick starting or further progressing the transition to clean energy and to achieve their climate targets.
Cryobiological Divestiture
On October 1, 2020, we closed on the sale of our cryobiological products business, which was formerly within our D&S West segment prior to the realignment of our segment reporting structuring in the fourth quarter of 2020, as further discussed in the following paragraph, to Cryoport, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYRX) for net cash proceeds of $317.5 million, inclusive of the base purchase price of $320.0 million less estimated closing adjustments of $2.5 million (the “Cryobiological Divestiture”). The strategic decision to divest of our cryobiological products business reflects our strategy and capital allocation approach to focus on our core capabilities and offerings. We recorded a gain, net of taxes on the Cryobiological Divestiture of $224.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Reorganization of Reportable Segments
As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, the structure of our internal organization was divided into the following reportable segments, which were also our operating segments: D&S East, D&S West, E&C Cryogenics and E&C FinFans. Effective October 1, 2020, we changed our reportable segments to the following four reportable segments, which are also our operating segments: Cryo Tank Solutions, Heat Transfer Systems, Specialty Products and Repair, Service & Leasing. Further detailed information regarding our operating segments is presented in Note 4, “Segment and Geographic Information,” of the consolidated financial statements included under Item 15 “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The financial information presented and discussion of results that follows is presented on a continuing operations basis. All prior period amounts presented below have been reclassified based on our current reportable segments.
2020 Highlights
Being at the forefront of the clean energy transition, Chart is a leading provider of technology, equipment and services related to liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, biogas and CO2 Capture amongst other applications. We saw record backlog in our Cryo Tank Solutions and Specialty Products segments of $222.6 million and $199.7 million at December 31, 2020,
respectively. Total backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $810.0 million and $751.2 million, respectively. Our backlog as of December 31, 2020 was inclusive of $21.0 million of backlog remaining on the Venture Global Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal project order (“Calcasieu Pass”), compared to $117.6 million of Calcasieu Pass remaining as of December 31, 2019. Excluding Calcasieu Pass, backlog increased by $155.4 million or 24.5% in 2020 compared to 2019. Orders of $279.2 million and $196.8 million for our Specialty Products and Repair, Service & Leasing segments, respectively, were records in 2020 based on favorable HLNG vehicle tank and hydrogen equipment orders and full lifecycle and leasing services. Operating Income was a record in each of our four segments. Furthermore, as a percentage of sales, operating income was a record in each of our four segments primarily driven by ongoing cost structure improvement across the global organization. Further driving our strategy, we executed on three acquisitions and two investments during 2020, which are discussed below:
Sustainable Energy Solutions, Inc. Acquisition: On December 23, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Sustainable Energy Solutions, Inc. (“SES”). SES’s Cryogenic Carbon Capture™ (CCC) technology eliminates most emissions from fossil fuels while enabling better use of intermittent renewables through grid-scale energy storage. The stock purchase was completed for a closing purchase price of $20.0 million in cash at closing, subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment, plus a potential earn-out not to exceed $25.0 million in the aggregate.
BlueInGreen, LLC Acquisition: On November 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of BlueInGreen, LLC (“BIG”), a leading dissolved-gas expert providing custom-engineered solutions for water treatment and industrial process applications that delivers tangible economic, social and environmental value. The stock purchase was completed for a purchase price of $20.0 million in cash at closing (subject to customary adjustments), plus a potential earn-out not to exceed $6.0 million in the aggregate.
Alabama Trailers Acquisition: On October 13, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Theodore, Alabama cryogenic trailer and hydrogen trailer (transport) assets of Worthington Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WOR) for $10.0 million in cash (“Alabama Trailers”). Alabama Trailers designs, manufactures and sells cryogenic trailers and hydrogen trailers used in industrial gas and energy applications. This acquisition will produce strong synergies by combining Chart’s deep knowledge of cryogenics and liquid hydrogen storage and handling with Alabama Trailers’ expertise and experience in the packaging and assembly of liquid hydrogen trailers. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded a bargain purchase gain of $5.0 million.
HTEC Investment: During the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed an investment in HTEC Hydrogen Technology & Energy Corporation (“HTEC”) in the amount of CAD20 million ($15.7 million) for 15.6% of its capital stock on a fully-diluted basis. HTEC designs, builds, and operates hydrogen fuel supply solutions to support the deployment of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. It has significant hydrogen development experience in the Canadian market, with signed contracts for numerous projects across the country.
McPhy Investment: Also during the fourth quarter of 2020, we made an investment in McPhy (Euronext Paris: MCPHY - ISIN; FR0011742329) by subscribing to 1,276,595 shares for 30 million euros ($35.1 million). As of December 31, 2020, we hold 4.6% of the capital of McPhy and the value of the investment was $53.8 million, which reflects a $17.0 million unrealized gain upon conversion and subsequent mark-to-market. Gains and losses for this investment in equity securities were recorded in other expenses, net on the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Outlook
Our 2021 full year outlook reflects execution on the clean energy transition including recovery in air cooled heat exchangers related to growth in CO2 Capture applications, small scale LNG opportunities and growth in our Specialty Products business, especially in water treatment, over the road trucking and hydrogen applications. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to redeploy capital from the Cryobiological Divestiture into clean energy applications. As such, on February 2, 2021, we completed a $15 million investment in Svante Inc. and signed a commercial carbon capture memorandum of understanding to explore commercial opportunities as a channel to market preferred partners and collaborate to develop an integrated carbon capture solution using Svante’s rapid adsorption technology and Chart’s cryogenic carbon capture technology to make high-purity CO2 products from industrial flue gas streams. On February 16, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Cryogenic Gas Technologies, Inc. (“Cryo Technologies”) for approximately $55 million in cash (subject to certain customary adjustments). Cryo Technologies is a global leader in custom engineered process systems to separate, purify, refrigerate, liquefy and distribute high value industrial gases such as hydrogen, helium, argon and hydrocarbons with design capabilities for cold boxes for hydrogen and helium use. The distribution systems Cryo Technologies supplies are located within the helium and hydrogen liquefaction facilities and are inclusive of trailer loading systems, which facilitates the first step in product distribution. Our 2021 sales outlook is inclusive of $21 million of Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass revenue in the first quarter of 2021 as well as $30 million of 2021 revenue from the acquisition of Cryo Technologies. There is no additional Big LNG
revenue included in our outlook although we believe new orders will be received during the year. We continue to invest in our automation, process improvement, and productivity activities across Chart, with total anticipated 2021 capital expenditures spend of $40.0 million to $50.0 million.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Sales in 2020 decreased by $38.4 million from $1,215.5 million to $1,177.1 million, or 3.2%. Heat Transfer Systems segment sales decreased by $71.9 million during 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to an industry-wide softness in demand for midstream and upstream compression equipment. This decrease with the Heat Transfer Systems segment was partially offset by revenue contributions from the continued execution of our backlog on big LNG, including Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal project and other petrochemical applications and our Specialty Products segment where sales increased by $34.7 million as compared to 2019 primarily driven by favorable sales in hydrogen equipment and HLNG vehicle tanks.
Gross profit in 2020 increased by $34.6 million from $297.5 million to $332.1 million, or 11.6% compared to 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased within each of our four segments in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of ongoing cost structure improvement across the global organization, the impact of higher restructuring costs in 2019 within our Cryo Tank Solutions segment and product mix, especially where Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal project drove higher margins in our Heat Transfer Systems segment.
SG&A expenses decreased by $27.5 million, or 13.4% in 2020 compared to 2019 across multiple SG&A categories primarily as a result of cost reduction initiatives. During 2020, we implemented certain cost reduction actions across all segments and corporate to appropriately size our workforce with demand as well as eliminate redundant work. Costs were primarily related to headcount reductions. These actions resulted in total restructuring costs of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisting of mainly employee severance costs. As previously reported, on July 17, 2020, we announced internally our intention to transfer operations of our heat exchanger leased facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma to our Beasley, Texas location at which we own 260 acres of land. This was a cost reduction measure within our Heat Transfer Systems segment to structure the business for profitable growth in equipment for midstream and upstream energy applications. Total costs related to this action are expected to be approximately $9.0 million, of which $2.7 million has been spent year to date, associated with severance, relocation and moving expenses. We expect this project to be completed by June 30, 2021. We are closely monitoring our end markets and order rates and will continue to take appropriate and timely actions as necessary.
During 2019, we implemented certain cost reduction or avoidance actions, including facility consolidations at certain of our U.S. properties, and a streamlining of the commercial activities surrounding our Lifecycle business in our Repair, Service & Leasing segment, geographic realignment of our manufacturing capacity and a facility closure in Asia, as well as departmental restructuring, including headcount reductions in each of our four segments. These actions resulted in total restructuring costs of $15.6 million, consisting of employee severance costs, disposals of property, plant and equipment and other costs. Restructuring costs for 2019 reflect a $1.6 million credit to Repair, Service & Leasing segment restructuring costs recorded in the second quarter of 2019 due to the successful negotiation of a lease termination for a facility for our previous Lifecycle business. These restructuring activities were substantially completed by the end of 2019.
Impairment of Intangible assets
We recorded an impairment loss of $16.0 million during 2020 relative to our $55.0 million trademarks and trade names indefinite-lived intangible asset of our AXC business (“AXC Intangible Asset”) in our Heat Transfer Systems segment. Industry-wide softness in demand for midstream and upstream compression equipment represented impairment indicators requiring us to re-evaluate the fair value of the AXC Intangible Asset. We determined the fair value of the AXC Intangible Asset under the relief-from-royalty method and conducted an impairment test as defined in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section. We determined that the fair value of the AXC Intangible Asset was $39.0 million and impaired the AXC Intangible Asset by a value equal to the difference in the carrying amount and calculated fair value.
Interest Expense, Net and Financing Costs Amortization
Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $17.7 million and $14.7 million, respectively. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $2.6 million of 1.0% cash interest and $8.0 million of non-cash interest accretion expense related to the carrying value of the convertible notes due 2024, and $7.0 million in interest related to borrowings on our previous and current senior secured revolving credit facility and term loan. For 2020 and 2019, financing costs amortization was $4.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The increase of $1.3 million was primarily due to recognition of a full year of financing costs amortization related to the term loan in 2020 as compared to six months of financing costs amortization recognized in 2019.
Foreign Currency Loss (Gain)
For 2020 foreign currency losses were $0.9 million as compared to foreign currency gains of $0.4 million for 2019. Losses increased by $1.3 million during 2020 due to exchange rate volatility, especially with respect to the euro and Chinese yuan.
Gain on Bargain Purchase
As a result of the Alabama Trailers acquisition, we recorded a bargain purchase gain of $5.0 million.
Unrealized (Gain) Loss on Investment in Equity Securities
The unrealized gain on investment in equity securities was $13.1 million in 2020 as compared to the unrealized loss on investment in equity securities of $0.1 million in 2019. Gains increased by $13.2 million primarily due to an $17.0 million unrealized gain on the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in McPhy (Euronext Paris: MCPHY - ISIN; FR0011742329), partially offset by a $2.9 million unrealized loss on the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in Stabilis.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax expense of $14.9 million and expense of $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 represents taxes on both U.S. and foreign earnings at a combined effective income tax rate of 17.5% and 8.1%, respectively. The effective income tax rate of 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and the Alabama Trailers bargain purchase gain offset by the effect of income earned by certain of our foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the federal statutory rate as well as losses incurred by certain of our Chinese operations for which no benefit was recorded.
The effective income tax rate of 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to certain share-based compensation, partially offset by the effect of income earned by certain of our foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the federal statutory rate as well as losses incurred by certain of our Chinese operations for which no benefit was recorded.
Net Income from Continuing Operations
As a result of the foregoing, net income from continuing operations attributable to Chart was $68.9 million and $31.4 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Discontinued Operations
The financial results of our cryobiological products business formerly reported in our D&S West segment and financial results from our oxygen-related products business formerly reported in our BioMedical segment are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. For further information, refer to Note 3, “Discontinued Operations.”
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Sales in 2019 increased by $211.6 million from $1,003.9 million to $1,215.5 million, or 21.1% (1.9% organically), with increases across all segments as compared to 2018. AXC sales of $103.1 million are included in the Heat Transfer Systems segment results since the July 1, 2019 acquisition date. Sales for VRV in 2019, included in Cryo Tank Solutions, Heat Transfer Systems and Specialty segments’ results since the November 15, 2018 acquisition date were $104.0 million (Cryo Tank Solutions: $53.2 million, Heat Transfer Systems: $43.6 million, Specialty Products: $4.2 million, Repair, Service & Leasing: $3.0 million) as compared to $14.1 million (Cryo Tank Solutions: $9.3 million, Heat Transfer Systems: $3.2 million, Specialty Products: $0.6 million, Repair, Service & Leasing: $1.0 million) in 2018. Excluding the impact of AXC and VRV, sales growth was primarily driven by axial flow fans sales in our Heat Transfer Systems segment and an increase in HLNG vehicle tank sales within our Specialty Products segment.
Gross profit in 2019 increased by $38.4 million or 14.8% (0.7% organically) compared to 2018. AXC gross profit of $29.2 million is included in 2019, and gross profit for VRV was $8.5 million and $1.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding AXC and VRV, gross profit increased by $1.7 million. Gross profit included restructuring costs of $12.2 million and $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which during 2019 were related to cost reduction or avoidance actions, including facility consolidations across the global organization and a streamlining of the commercial activities surrounding our after-market services business in our Repair, Service & Leasing segment, geographic realignment of our manufacturing capacity and a facility closure in China, as well as departmental restructuring, including headcount reductions in each of our segments. Excluding the impact of the AXC and VRV acquisitions and restructuring costs, gross profit increased by $13.1 million. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 which decreased from 25.8% in 2018. Excluding the impact of the AXC and VRV acquisitions and restructuring costs, gross margin as a percent of sales was 27.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 which increased from 26.2% in the same period in 2018.
SG&A expenses increased by $33.0 million ($10.3 million organically), or 19.1% (6.0% organically) in 2019 compared to 2018. SG&A expenses for AXC were $7.8 million in 2019. Furthermore, SG&A expenses for VRV were $16.9 million and $2.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact of AXC and VRV, SG&A expenses were 17.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by Corporate SG&A expenses, which increased by $16.2 million during 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to $7.3 million in transaction-related costs, $4.3 million in integration costs related to acquisitions and an increase in share-based compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in employee-related costs.
Interest Expense, Net and Financing Costs Amortization
Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $14.7 million and $21.4 million, respectively. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $2.6 million of 1.0% cash interest and $7.6 million of non-cash interest accretion expense related to the carrying value of the convertible notes due 2024, and $5.3 million in interest related to borrowings on our previous and current senior secured revolving credit facility and term loan. For 2019 and 2018, financing costs amortization was $3.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The increase of $1.7 million was primarily due to higher financing costs amortization as a result of debt restructuring actions in 2019.
Foreign Currency (Gain) Loss
For 2019, foreign currency gains were $0.4 million as compared to foreign currency losses of $0.1 million for 2018. Gains increased by $0.5 million during 2019 due to exchange rate volatility, especially with respect to the euro and Chinese yuan.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense
Income tax expense of $2.8 million and expense of $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 represents taxes on both U.S. and foreign earnings at a combined effective income tax rate of 8.1% and 17.3%, respectively. The effective income tax rate of 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a reduction in our state tax rate partially offset by the effect of income earned by certain of our foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the federal statutory rate as well as losses incurred by certain of our Chinese operations for which no benefit was recorded.
The effective income tax rate of 17.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to certain share-based compensation, partially offset by the effect of income earned by certain of our foreign entities being taxed at higher rates than the federal statutory rate as well as losses incurred by certain of our Chinese operations for which no benefit was recorded.
Net Income from Continuing Operations
As a result of the foregoing, net income from continuing operations attributable to Chart was $31.4 million and $32.5 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Segment Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
Our reportable and operational segments include: Cryo Tank Solutions, Heat Transfer Systems, Specialty Products and Repair, Service & Leasing. Corporate includes operating expenses for executive management, accounting, tax, treasury, corporate development, human resources, information technology, investor relations, legal, internal audit, and risk management. Corporate support functions are not currently allocated to the segments. For further information, refer to Note 4, “Segment and Geographic Information” of our consolidated financial statements included under Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following tables include key metrics used to evaluate our business and measure our performance and represents selected financial data for our operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):
Cryo Tank Solutions-Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
For the year 2020, Cryo Tank Solutions segment sales increased by $5.9 million as compared to 2019 primarily due to higher volume in engineered tanks in the U.S. and higher mobile equipment sales in China, partially offset by lower sales in storage equipment in the U.S. mainly driven by business disruptions where certain of our large customers shut down production temporarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic earlier in the year.
For the year 2020, Cryo Tank Solutions segment gross profit increased by $22.3 million as compared to 2019. This increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to increased volume efficiencies related to our mobile equipment product lines in China and in VRV and one-time restructuring costs in China during 2019. The increase in the related margin percentage was primarily driven by restructuring costs in 2019 and favorable product mix as our Cryo Tank Solutions segment operations in Europe and China gained better leverage on increased volume. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable product mix relative to engineered systems related to our U.S. Cryo Tank Solutions segment operations.
Cryo Tank Solutions SG&A expenses decreased during the year 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily driven by lower employee-related costs as a result of cost reduction actions. Restructuring expenses were $2.3 million in 2020 as compared to $1.1 million in 2019. Cryo Tank Solutions SG&A expenses include a $2.6 million gain on sale of China facility in 2020.
Cryo Tank Solutions-Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
For the full year 2019, Cryo Tank Solutions segment sales increased by $38.5 million compared to 2018. Sales for VRV, included in the Cryo Tank Solutions segment since the acquisition date November 15, 2018, were $53.2 million and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact of VRV, Cryo Tank Solutions
segment sales decreased by $5.4 million during 2019, which was primarily driven by lower sales in China largely relative to a decline in LNG and bulk products partially offset by an increase in all product applications in Europe.
During the full year 2019, Cryo Tank Solutions segment gross profit decreased by $10.1 million as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of higher restructuring costs in 2019 as compared to 2018. Gross profit for VRV included in the Cryo Tank Solutions segment was $2.6 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact of VRV, gross profit decreased by $11.3 million. Restructuring expenses recognized in cost of sales were $7.8 million ($7.6 million excluding VRV) and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The restructuring charges that negatively impacted the Cryo Tank Solutions segment gross profit and the related margin percentage were primarily due to the closing of two production lines in China.

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contingencies
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste water effluents, air emissions, and handling and disposal of hazardous materials, such as cleaning fluids. We are involved with environmental compliance, investigation, monitoring, and remediation activities at certain of our owned and formerly owned manufacturing facilities and at one owned facility that is leased to a third party, and, except for these continuing remediation efforts, believes we are currently in substantial compliance with all known environmental regulations. Management believes that any additional liability in excess of amounts accrued, which may result from the resolution of such matters, should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, cash flows or results of operations.
We are occasionally subject to various legal claims related to performance under contracts, product liability, taxes, employment matters, environmental matters, intellectual property, and other matters, several of which claims assert substantial damages, in the ordinary course of our business. Based on our historical experience in litigating these claims, as well as our current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, if any, we believe the resolution of these legal claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, cash flows or results of operations. Future developments may, however, result in resolution of these legal claims in a way that could have a material adverse effect. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” for further information.
Foreign Operations
During 2020, we had operations in Asia, Australia, India, Europe, and South America, which accounted for approximately 51% of consolidated sales and 31% of total assets at December 31, 2020.
