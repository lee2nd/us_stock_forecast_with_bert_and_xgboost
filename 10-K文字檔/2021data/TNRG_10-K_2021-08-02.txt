Economic Injury Disaster Loan
On May 14, 2020, the Company executed the standard loan documents required for securing a loan (the “EIDL Loan”) from the SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business.
Pursuant to that certain Loan Authorization and Agreement (the “SBA Loan Agreement”), the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of $150,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 14, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Note) in the amount of $731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the date of the SBA Note. In connection therewith, the Company also received a $7,000 grant, which does not have to be repaid. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $7,000 was recorded in Other Income in the Statements of Operations.
In connection therewith, the Company executed (i) a note for the benefit of the SBA (the “SBA Note”), which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property of the Company, which also contains customary events of default (the “SBA Security Agreement”).
Paycheck Protection Program Loan Round
On May 6, 2020, the Company executed a note (the “PPP Note”) for the benefit of TD Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”) in the aggregate amount of $51,065 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The PPP is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of the PPP Note, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the PPP Note (the “Maturity Date”). The PPP Note contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Note. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Note, collection of all amounts owing from the Company, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in obtaining forgiveness of the loan in whole or in part. The PPP Note of $51,065 was repaid in February 2021.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan Round 2
On April 2, 2021, the Company executed a note (the “PPP Note”) for the benefit of First Federal Bank (the “Lender”) in the aggregate amount of $200,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) through a second draw. The PPP is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The terms of the second draw have the same general loan terms as the first draw PPP loan.

Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There is limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue operations.

How We Generate Revenue
On January 19, 2019 (date of formation), the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Results for the reporting periods beginning on January 19, 2019 (date of formation) are presented under ASC 606.
The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer.
2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.
3. Determination of the transaction price.
4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. The Company allocates the entire transaction price to a single performance obligation.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities are as follows:
Other sales - The Company offers consumer products through its online websites. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded retail sales of $4,650,100 and $2,204,316, respectively.
Mask sales - As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, in 2020, the Company entered into the sale of KN95 masks but had to dispose of them at a loss. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded mask sales of $3,054,201 and $0, respectively.
The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs, or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices.
Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company primarily provides for no credit terms as it collects a deposit of 50% upon order and requires the remaining 50% be paid before the order is shipped. When credit terms are granted, terms of up to 120 days are provided, based on credit evaluations. No allowance has been provided for uncollectible accounts. Management has evaluated the receivables and believes they are collectible based on the nature of the receivables, historical experience of credit losses, and all other currently available evidence. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales taxes.
Results of Operations.
The results of operations are based on preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to the Notes of Financial Statements.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

The following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods indicated:
Years Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Cash Flows from Operating Activities - For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $229,432. Net cash used in operations was primarily due to a net loss of $550,602, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of $579,286, primarily due to the net changes in customer advance payments of $488,422, accrued interest of $359,562, accounts receivable of $42,608, and other current liabilities of $71,703, offset primarily by the change in inventories of $111,106, prepaid expenses of $126,168, other current assets of $24,799, accounts payable of $80,936. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities was offset primarily by adjustments to reconcile net profit from the accretion of the debt discount of $187,293, change in derivative liability of $21,445, common stock issued for services of $33,232, depreciation expense of $11,854, amortization expense of $5,695, and the gain on conversion of convertible notes payable of $58,771.

Net cash used in operations was primarily due to a net loss of $97,312, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of $97,941, primarily due to the net changes in accounts payable of $233,082, customer advance payments of $73,836, and other current liabilities of $8,328, offset primarily by accounts receivable of $140,559, inventories of $57,364, and prepaid expenses of $19,382.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities - For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $72,236 due to proceeds from loan payable to shareholder of $110,868, repayments from loan payable to shareholder of $42,463, proceeds from short term notes payable of $201,035, repayments of short term notes payable of $20,000, proceeds from short term notes payable - related party of $284,744, repayments of short term notes payable - related party of $549,257, and the proceeds from convertible notes payable of $820,000. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $20,000 due to proceeds from loan payable to shareholder of $23,000, offset primarily by repayments of loan payable to shareholder of $3,000.
Financing - We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to implement our strategy. We do not have the necessary cash and revenue to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months. We cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then we may not be able to expand our operations. If adequate funds are not available, we believe that our officers and directors will contribute funds to pay for some of our expenses. However, we have not made any arrangements or agreements with our officers and directors regarding such advancement of funds. We do not know whether we will issue stock for the loans or whether we will merely prepare and sign promissory notes. If we are forced to seek funds from our officers or directors, we will negotiate the specific terms and conditions of such loan when made, if ever. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company’s securities after the completion of this offering. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See “Note 2 - Going Concern” in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a “going concern.”
We are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity.

Economic Injury Disaster Loan
On May 14, 2020, the Company executed the standard loan documents required for securing a loan (the “EIDL Loan”) from the SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business.
Pursuant to that certain Loan Authorization and Agreement (the “SBA Loan Agreement”), the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of $150,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 14, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Note) in the amount of $731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the date of the SBA Note. In connection therewith, the Company also received a $7,000 grant, which does not have to be repaid.

In connection therewith, the Company executed (i) a note for the benefit of the SBA (the “SBA Note”), which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property of the Company, which also contains customary events of default (the “SBA Security Agreement”).
Paycheck Protection Program Loan Round
On May 6, 2020, the Company executed a note (the “PPP Note”) for the benefit of TD Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”) in the aggregate amount of $51,065 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The PPP is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of the PPP Note, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the PPP Note (the “Maturity Date”). The PPP Note contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Note. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Note, collection of all amounts owing from the Company, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all, or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in obtaining forgiveness of the loan in whole or in part. The PPP Note of $51,065 was repaid in February 2021.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan Round 2
On April 2, 2021, the Company executed a note (the “PPP Note”) for the benefit of First Federal Bank (the “Lender”) in the aggregate amount of $200,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) through a second draw.

Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $648,000 and $97,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, had a working capital deficit of $1,569,000 and $216,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, had a net losses of approximately $551,000 and $97,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $229,000 and $32,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with limited revenue earned since inception, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Commission has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results.
The following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: inventory valuation, common stock valuation, and the recoverability of intangibles. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.
Revenue Recognition
On January 19, 2019 (date of formation), the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Results for the reporting periods beginning on January 19, 2019 (date of formation) are presented under ASC 606.
The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer.
2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.
3. Determination of the transaction price.
4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. The Company allocates the entire transaction price to a single performance obligation.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities are as follows:
Other sales - The Company offers consumer products through its online websites. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded retail sales of $4,620,105 and $2,204,316, respectively.
Mask sales - As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, in 2020, the Company entered into the sale of KN95 masks but had to dispose of them at a loss. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded mask sales of $3,054,201 and $0, respectively.
The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices.
Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company primarily provides for no credit terms as it collects a deposit of 50% upon order and requires the remaining 50% be paid before the order is shipped. When credit terms are granted, terms of up to 120 days are provided, based on credit evaluations. No allowance has been provided for uncollectible accounts. Management has evaluated the receivables and believes they are collectible based on the nature of the receivables, historical experience of credit losses, and all other currently available evidence. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales taxes.
Customer Advanced Payments
Customer advanced payments consists of customer orders paid in advance of the delivery of the order. Customer advanced payments are classified as short-term as the typical order ships within approximately three weeks of placing the order. Customer advanced payments are recognized as revenue when the product is shipped to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Customer advanced payments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $522,258 and $73,836, respectively. Customer advanced payments are included in current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated Balance Sheets.
Inventories
The Company manufactures its own products, made to order, and when completed are shipped to the customer. The Company's inventories are valued by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company had inventories of $168,470 and $57,364, respectively, consisting of mostly finished goods as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of property, equipment and intangible assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. There are no impairments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Our impairment analyses require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets, assessing the probability of different outcomes, and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, we assess the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third-party comparable sales and discounted cash flow models. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets. However, there can be no assurances that the demand for the Company’s products and services will continue, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets in the future.
Income Taxes
As a result of the Company’s Interest Purchase Agreement, the Company converted to a corporation (“Conversion”). Beginning on August 14, 2020, the Company’s results of operations are taxed as a C Corporation. Prior to the Conversion, the Company’s operations were taxed as a limited liability company, whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for periods prior to August 14, 2020.
The unaudited computation of income taxes included in the Statements of Operations, represents the tax effects that would have been reported had the Company been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation for all periods presented. Taxes are based upon the statutory income tax rates and adjustments to income for estimated permanent differences occurring during each period. Actual rates and expenses could have differed had the Company actually been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes for all periods presented.
We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on our balance sheets in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. We must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in our valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income tax provision on the consolidated Statements of Operations.
From the date of our inception, we adopted ASC 740-10-30. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, and currently, we do not have a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825 requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows:
· Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
· Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
· Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. There were no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. There have been no transfers between levels.
The derivatives are evaluated under the hierarchy of ASC 480-10, ASC Paragraph 815-25-1 and ASC Subparagraph 815-10-15-74 addressing embedded derivatives. The fair value of the Level 3 financial instruments was performed internally by the Company using the Black Scholes valuation method.
The following table summarize the Company’s fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2020 for the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
The following table summarize the Company’s fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2019 for the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash, other current assets, accounts payable, accruals, and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment.
Debt
We issue debt that may have separate warrants, conversion features, or no equity-linked attributes.
Debt with warrants - When we issue debt with warrants, we treat the warrants as a debt discount, record as a contra-liability against the debt, and amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statements of operations. When the warrants require equity treatment under ASC 815, the offset to the contra-liability is recorded as additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet. When we issue debt with warrants that require liability treatment under ASC 815, such as a clause requiring repricing, the warrants are considered to be a derivative that is recorded as a liability at fair value. If the initial value of the warrant derivative liability is higher than the fair value of the associated debt, the excess is recognized immediately as interest expense. The warrant derivative liability is adjusted to its fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change being recorded as expense or gain. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The debt is treated as conventional debt.
Convertible debt - derivative treatment - When we issue debt with a conversion feature, we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, as follows: a) one or more underlyings, typically the price of our common stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. An embedded equity-linked component that meets the definition of a derivative does not have to be separated from the host instrument if the component qualifies for the scope exception for certain contracts involving an issuer’s own equity. The scope exception applies if the contract is both a) indexed to its own stock; and b) classified in shareholders’ equity in its statement of financial position.
If the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using the Black Scholes method upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The convertible debt derivative is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt.
Convertible debt - beneficial conversion feature - If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF’). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the consolidated balance sheet. We amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations.
If the conversion feature does not qualify for either the derivative treatment or as a BCF, the convertible debt is treated as traditional debt.

On May 14, 2020, the Company executed the standard loan documents required for securing a loan (the “EIDL Loan”) from the SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business.
Pursuant to that certain Loan Authorization and Agreement (the “SBA Loan Agreement”), the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of $150,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 14, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Note) in the amount of $731.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $7,000 was recorded in Other Income in the Statements of Operations.
In connection therewith, the Company executed (i) a note for the benefit of the SBA (the “SBA Note”), which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property of the Company, which also contains customary events of default (the “SBA Security Agreement”).
Paycheck Protection Program Loan Round
On May 6, 2020, the Company executed a note (the “PPP Note”) for the benefit of TD Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”) in the aggregate amount of $51,065 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The PPP is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of the PPP Note, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the PPP Note (the “Maturity Date”). The PPP Note contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Note. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Note, collection of all amounts owing from the Company, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in obtaining forgiveness of the loan in whole or in part. The PPP Note of $51,065 was repaid in February 2021.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan Round 2
On April 2, 2021, the Company executed a note (the “PPP Note”) for the benefit of First Federal Bank (the “Lender”) in the aggregate amount of $200,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) through a second draw.
