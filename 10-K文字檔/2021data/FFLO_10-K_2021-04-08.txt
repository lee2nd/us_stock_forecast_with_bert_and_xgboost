PLAN OF OPERATIONS
Auto Parts Division:
The auto parts business is a phenomena that must be well understood before plan of operation is discussed. Auto parts are bought or sold when there is a need for them. Reducing price or encouraging customers to “buy one and get one free” is not applicable in this line of business. Thus the list price of the parts are more or less firm and if they are priced/listed in line with the prices quoted by other competitors they do sell at the listed price. The only uncertain element like in pharmaceutical industry is that they are sold when needed but must be readily available
when need emerges. These auto parts do not have any shelf life, these are neither subject to change in fashion nor are perishable and they do eventually sell.
Keeping the above fact in mind, the management has discovered that the greater the inventory than the greater is the probability that it would generate sales. An in-house analysis by management has revealed that approximately 25% of the inventory in hand sells on an annual basis. It was therefore imperative that the inventory be increased to MSRP cruising level of $5,000,000 to achieve a $1,250,000 + in sales which would thereby generate a cash surplus in net profits of the company. With the acquisition of the second facility, FFLO’s inventory level of MSRP has increased to the desired level of over $5,000,000.00 against the book value of $1,778,824. It is thus anticipated that the annual sales would be over $1,000,000 during the year 2021.
FFLO has raised its bar to build inventory to MSRP of $10,000,000 and is actively seeking additional $1,000,000 funding to build inventory.
During the year 2020, there were enough automobiles available for dismantling and a greater number could have been purchased, but the company was not successful in finding skilled labor thus resulting in a slow-down of inventory build-up. It is taking more time to process than what could have been achieved if more skilled labor was available. Also due to COVID19 the availability of wrecked automobiles has diminished having resulted from less automobiles on the road, also people who have end of life automobiles restrained from inviting the collection people to come to them to pick up the vehicles.
Motors & Metal, Inc. - Progress discussed as under:
Having received the letter of intent from a bonafide buyer the Company began sourcing scrap metal for export and after nearly six month of vigorous efforts concluded that none of the existing processors were prepared to offer the shredded steel. The Company was already processing scrap metal but in very limited quantities which were not enough for export trade.
The management began to work on expanding its own scrap metal processing capabilities and upon getting a reconfirmation of zoning from the County Office, Motors & Metals, Inc., in January of 2020 received its license to operate as “Scrap Metal Processor”. The management received several quotations from various equipment manufacturers and is in the process of negotiating purchase of machinery so that it is able to process the desired quantity of scrap metal for export.
Upon the news being made public, the Company has received from other qualified buyer abroad “expression of interest” to purchase scrap metal. The annual sales of scrap metal are expected to exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). The Company hopes that it will be able to complete its expansion plan within next 12 months.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred operational expenses of $430,604 including a depreciation allowance of $59,018. The decrease of appx. $37,354 was primarily a result of decrease in administrative expenses.
