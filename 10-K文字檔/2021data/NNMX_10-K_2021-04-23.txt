Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk, uncertainties and other factors. These statements are often identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “estimate,” or “continue,” and similar expressions or variations. Actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and other factors that we may not know.
Overview
Boston Therapeutics, headquartered in Lawrence, MA, (OTCQB: BTHE) is a leader in the field of complex carbohydrate chemistry and peptide therapeutic drug discovery and development. The Company’s initial product pipeline is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic molecules for sugar control more specifically prediabetics and diabetes: investigative material BTI-320, a non- systemic, non-toxic, investigative therapeutic compound designed to reduce post-meal glucose elevation. In addition, under manufacturing control, SUGARDOWN®, a similar base material to BTI-320 has progressed into market testing as a dietary supplement designed to manage post-meal sugar spikes. Recently, with the acquisition of CureDM in the first quarter of 2018, a new investigative material BTI-410, an injectable peptide, may fulfill the medical need to replace injection of insulin by stimulating the beta cell maturation. And the adjunctive therapeutic material called IPOXYN, is an investigative intravenous fluid therapy for the prevention of necrosis and a treatment for ischemia, with an initial target indication of lower limb ischemic events often associated with diabetes. This covers a wider combined prevention and therapeutic option for the growing worldwide epidemic related to metabolic diseases with diabetes being the leader.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited cash resources, recurring cash used in operations and operating losses history. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $28.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and used cash in operations of $784,299 during the year ended December 31, 2020. These factors among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company has incurred recurring operating losses since inception as it has worked to bring its SUGARDOWN® product to market and develop BTI-320 and IPOXYN. Management expects such operating losses will continue until such time that substantial revenues are received from SUGARDOWN® or the regulatory and clinical development of BTI-320 or IPOXYN is completed. The Company has approximately $7,400 cash on hand at December 31, 2020. Management is currently seeking additional capital through private placements and public offerings of its common stock. In addition, the Company may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings as well as collaboration activities in order to fund our operations. The Company was advanced $250,000 through the issuance of 10% notes payable to a related party during the first quarter of 2020. The Company was advanced $330,000 through the issuance of 10% notes payable to a related party during the second quarter of 2020. The Company was advanced $230,000 through the issuance of 10% notes payable to a related party during the third quarter of 2020. The Company was advanced $25,000 through the issuance of 10% notes payable to a related party during the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company has been advanced $220,000 through the issuance of 10% notes payable to a related party during the first quarter of 2021. Management anticipates that cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the second quarter of 2021. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain continued financing and upon future profitable operations from the partnering, development and clarity of its new business opportunities.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing our objectives. Without such additional capital, we may be required to cease operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The pandemic novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19 and our Company’s responses to the outbreak have all disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business. In the United States, individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing, restricted from gathering in groups and in some areas, placed on complete restriction from non-essential movements outside of their homes. As a result, disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital.
