ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements. This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
COVID-19 Pandemic
During the first quarter of 2020, the global economy began experiencing a downturn related to the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Such impacts have included significant volatility in the global stock markets, a significant reduction in the target federal funds rate, the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, including the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA), and a variety of local, state and federal restrictions, measures and guidance. While many businesses resumed operations towards the end of the second quarter of 2020, the duration of the impact still remains uncertain. We expect to see continued volatility in the economic markets and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changing conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on our operating results during future periods.
Supply Chain and Outsourcing Partners
As a result of COVID-19, we have encountered various supply chain disruptions impacting the availability and lead times of certain raw materials for our finished goods products. We have been proactively identifying alternative sources for delayed raw materials and our highest demand products remain unaffected. All of our outsourcing partners, including contract manufacturing plants and third-party logistics warehouses, have remained open during the entirety of COVID-19, however, they have had difficulties with staffing their workforce to keep production lines running.
Health and Safety
We have taken proactive, aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and other counterparties. We have implored employees to continue to work from home and have strict requirements for employees who must enter our corporate office, such as body temperature documentation, mask requirements, and scheduling that limits physical employee interaction. We have continued our travel suspension and workspace disinfection. We expect to continue to implement these and other measures as appropriate.
Customer Demand
At the onset of the pandemic, as a result of government-mandated stay-at-home orders, some of our customers were impacted and forced to cease operations. Customer closings primarily impacted revenue for our Batiste Dry Shampoo distributed products during the last part of March 2020. Shipments to our major Batiste Dry Shampoo customers resumed in May 2020, but at lower levels than preceded the pandemic due to lower foot traffic, which has been largely caused by the new work-from-home environment and retail closures. Any future customer closures, customer restrictions, or continued foot traffic decrease would negatively impact our business.
Liquidity
Although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our future results, we believe our business model, available COVID-19 relief programs and our new debt agreement with UMB leave us well-positioned to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to develop and will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs during the next twelve months.
COVID-19 has impacted our ability to meet customer demand, has delayed our ability to quickly repay debt, and has resulted in increased financing costs.
We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. Given the dynamic nature of
this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.
Executive Overview
Our Business
Scott’s Liquid Gold-Inc. exists to positively impact consumers’ lives in the markets we serve and create shareholder value. We develop, market, and sell high-quality, high-value household and personal care products nationally and internationally to mass merchandisers, drugstores, supermarkets, hardware stores, e-commerce retailers, other retail outlets, and to wholesale distributors. Our long history of selling household products has generated strong consumer and customer loyalty for our brands.
On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor our business health and performance. These key indicators include (but are not limited to) the following:
•
Net sales (collectively, by operating segment, and by manufactured versus distributed products);
•
Profitability, focusing on gross margins and net income; and
•
Cash flow.
To achieve our business and financial objectives, we focus on initiatives to drive the growth of the key indicators above. Our ability to drive and generate growth depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ willingness to carry our products in a competitive marketplace. In this environment, we intend to continue to focus on our key indicators to remain competitive, sustain our current level of operations, and drive further growth in future periods.
Outlook
Looking forward, we are focused on both short- and long-term strategies that we believe will enhance our financial health and deliver shareholder value. While the marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we expect that the category challenges and the level of competition will continue to rise. We believe that some of the trends in our business and industry could adversely affect our profitability, including the following:
•
Changes in national and international regulations;
•
Changes in policies or practices of some of our key retail customers;
•
Potential continuation of decreasing sales of our distributed products;
•
Rapid growth of e-commerce and alternative retail channels; and
•
Volatility in the costs of raw materials.
We believe our history of providing high-quality, high-value products to consumers positions us to meet the challenges in our marketplace by continuing to focus on the following key priorities in 2021:
•
Pursuing growth opportunities, including distributing Alpha® Skin Care, Kids N Pets®, and Scott’s Liquid Gold® to broader markets;
•
Building finished goods inventory for our products to position us for supply chain volatility and growth opportunities;
•
Improving our processes and systems, specifically through the implementation of a new ERP; and
•
Optimizing our supply chain, third-party logistics partners, and operations.
Results of Operations
Increase in net loss changed primarily due to the following:
•
Impairment for raw material inventory no longer useable due to lower sales during COVID and supply chain issues.
•
Additional intangible asset amortization associated with our Biz and Dryel acquisition and a full year of amortization for our Kids N Pets intangibles.
•
Incremental increase in selling expenses driven by initial start-up costs for new third-party logistics providers.
•
Increase in interest expense related to our UMB debt financing.
•
Partially offset by:
o
A full year of Kids N Pets sales and our 2020 acquisition of Biz and Dryel. Net sales attributable to these acquisitions totaled $7,970, comprised of $3,618 for Kids N Pets and $4,352 of net sales attributable to Biz and Dryel.
o
Other income associated with the termination of our exclusive distribution agreement with MJ.
o
Increase in gross margins due to outsourcing our product manufacturing.
Segment Results
The following tables show comparative net sales, gross margin, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, volume and percentage changes for our household and personal care products between periods:
Household products
•
Household products increase in net sales and income from operations was primarily attributable to our Kids N Pets, Biz and Dryel acquisitions, as well as cost efficiencies realized from our outsourcing transition. Net sales associated with these acquisitions totaled $7,970, comprised of $3,618 for Kids N Pets and $4,352 of net sales attributable to Biz and Dryel. This was partially offset by $158 of raw material impairment included in cost of sales.
Personal care products
•
Net sales of distributed personal care products decreased primarily due to lower Batiste sales resulting from reduced store traffic due to COVID-19 and the related work-from-home shift, as well as the termination of our exclusive distribution agreement with MJ during the second quarter of 2020.
•
Net sales of manufactured personal care products decreased primarily due to lower sales of Alpha Skin Care, Denorex, Diabetic and Prell resulting from COVID-related reduced store traffic and COVID-related raw material supply chain issues.
•
Decrease in gross profit primarily due to our significant inventory impairment related to obsolete raw materials.
•
Increase in loss from operations primarily due to the loss of MJ, our decreased gross profit due to $718 of impairment for raw materials, and third-party logistic start-up costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Financing Agreements
Please see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our Loan Agreement (defined below) with UMB, which replaced our Prior Credit Agreement with Chase on July 1, 2020.
Liquidity and Changes in Cash Flows
At December 31, 2020, we had $3,578 available on our revolving credit facility with UMB, and approximately $5 in cash on hand, a decrease of $1,089 from December 31, 2019 due to our acquisition of Biz and Dryel, which will help grow our household
segment.
The following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities:
•
Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to our Kids N Pets, Biz, and Dryel acquisitions, as well as decreased costs associated with outsourcing.
•
Net cash used in investing activities was related to the Biz and Dryel acquisition, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as part of our Elevation Transaction.
•
Net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to our UMB financing.
We anticipate that our existing cash and our anticipated future cash flow from operations, together with our Loan Facility, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the 12 months following the filing date of this Report. Beginning on April 1, 2021, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures associated with our ERP system implementation. These capital expenditures are fixed and recurring $38 monthly payments for implementation services and we have already paid for our ERP software.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue recognition policy is significant because the amount and timing of revenue is a key component of our results of operations. See Note 1(m), “Revenue Recognition” in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Our intangible assets and goodwill policy is significant because the amount is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Further, determining estimated useful lives of our intangible assets is subjective and can change the impact on our results of operations. See Note 1(i), “Intangible Assets and Goodwill” in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Inventories Valuation
Inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value, which is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We specifically identify impairment write downs for slow moving and obsolete products and raw materials based upon, among other things, an assessment of historical and anticipated sales of our products. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, the results of future periods may be impacted.
As of December 31, 2020, we specifically identified slow moving and obsolete raw material inventory, resulting in an impairment of $876.
Income Taxes
Our income taxes policy is significant because our estimate for taxes is a key component of our results of operations. See Note 1(l), “Income Taxes” in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For information on recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1(q), “Recently Issued Accounting Standards,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Subsequent Events
On March 26, 2021, we amended our Loan Agreement with UMB with the First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (“First Amendment”) to provide additional covenant flexibility as a result of pandemic related supply chain issues. The First Amendment is effective as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio, applicable for the months ending August 31, 2021 through December 31, 2021, on a trailing 12-month basis, and net equity covenant targets were modified and the interest rate for both our revolving credit facility and term loan will increase by 2.0%. The interest rate increase will remain until we have a consecutive three-month period of no defaults or events of default and our fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.20 to 1.00. Finally, the First Amendment provided minimum cumulative cash flow after debt service amounts for each monthly year-to-date period from January 1, 2021 through July 31, 2021.
The First Amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.22 to this Form 10-K.
