Total related party consulting fees were $220,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $125,100 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The consulting fees for June 30, 2021 consisted of i) $98,000 to Ancient Investments, LLC, a company owned by Keith Duffy, CEO and Scott Duffy, Executive Director of Operations, (ii) $54,000 for AMP Web services, a company owned by Pablo Lavigna, CTO, $38,000 to Edward DeFeudis, Director, $38,000 to Edward C.

The research and development expenses of $373,112 paid during the year ended June 30, 2021 were in connection with our Eco-Aero joint venture for the development of an aircraft. The research and development expenses of $6,376 paid during the year ended June 30, 2020 was paid for work on the Vertical Takeoff and Landing (“VTOL”) Halo aircraft technology.
Other Income (Expenses)
Total other expenses consist of amortization of debt discount related to convertible notes, interest expense related to convertible notes, gain on forgiveness of accounts payable and a loss on settlement of debt. Total other income (expenses) was $503,381 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $336,825 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to recording a loss on settlement of debt in the amount of 186,954.
Net loss
Total net loss was $2,702,602 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $699,564 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase of 286% was due to sales and marketing expenses of $1,047,120, increased general and administrative expenses and a loss on settlement of debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2021, we had a cash balance of $962,540 and working capital of $677,257. Our net loss of $2,702,602 in the year ended June 30, 2021 was mostly funded by proceeds raised from financings. We will need to raise working capital (or refinance existing short-term debt to long-term debt) to fund operations. Future equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders. Alternative forms of future financings may include preferences or rights superior to our common stock. Debt financings may involve a pledge of assets and will rank senior to our common stock. We have historically financed our operations through best-efforts private equity and debt financings. We do not have any credit or equity facilities available with financial institutions, stockholders or third-party investors, and will continue to rely on best efforts financings. The failure to raise sufficient capital will likely cause us to cease operations.
During the fiscal year 2021, our operating activities used $1,012,233 of net cash compared to using $349,586 of net cash flow in our operating activities during fiscal year 2020. This difference primarily resulted from the increase of operations.
Commitments for Capital Expenditures
To date, our operations have been funded primarily through private investors. Some of these investors have verbally committed additional funding for the Company, as needed. We have had a number of discussions with broker-dealers regarding the funding required to execute the Company’s business plan, which is to acquire and develop breakthrough technologies or business interests in those companies that have developed these technologies. We are in the process of issuing an offering document to obtain the funding for certain acquisitions that are in the discussion stages.
Off Balance Sheet Items
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities” (SPEs).
Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and American Aviation Technologies, LLC, its subsidiary, and Eco-Aero, LLC, its joint venture, and are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and presented in US dollars. The fiscal year end is June 30.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xeriant, Inc., and American Aviation Technologies, LLC, and Eco-Aero, LLC. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of beneficial conversion features and warrants associated with convertible debt. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level 2: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including all current liabilities are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
Deferred Taxes
The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ("ASC 740-10") for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.
Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and are considered immaterial. As of June 30, 2021 there are no deferred tax assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has no cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on an assessment of the Company's ability to collect on customer accounts receivable. There is judgment involved with estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and if the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make the required payments, the Company may be required to record additional allowances or charges against revenues. The Company writes-off accounts receivable against the allowance when it determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues its collection. The allowance for doubtful accounts is created by forming a credit balance which is deducted from the total receivables balance in the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020 there are no accounts receivable.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue includes product sales. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with Topic 606 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" which considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:
(i)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(ii)
the services have been rendered and all required milestones achieved,
(iii)
the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
(iv)
Collectability is reasonably assured.
For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no revenue.
Convertible Debentures
If the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provide for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature ("BCF"). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20 "Debt with Conversion and Other Options." In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the BCF, and the Company amortizes the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recorded a BCF in the amount of $171,957.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10") requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.
The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820-10") and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
Research and Development Expenses
Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $311,112 and $6,376 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Advertising, Marketing and Public Relations
The Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as they are incurred. The Company recorded advertising expenses in the amount of $1,047,120 and $1,211 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Offering Costs
Costs incurred in connection with raising capital by the issuance of common stock are recorded as contra equity and deducted from the capital raised. There were no offering costs for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of general and administrative expenses. Our consolidated federal tax return and any state tax returns are not currently under examination.
The Company has adopted FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued as a new Topic, ASC Topic 606. The new revenue recognition standard supersedes all existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14, issued in August 2015, deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017.
In February 2016, FASB issued ASC 842 that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The update, which supersedes existing lease guidance, will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with the classification determining the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
The ASU will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is applicable on a modified retrospective basis with various optional practical expedients. The Company has assessed the impact of this standard. The Company entered into a new lease agreement commencing on November 1, 2019 and implemented this guidance on November 1, 2019.
In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This update addresses a diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
On June 20, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to nonemployees (for example, service providers, external legal counsel, suppliers, etc.). Under the new standard, companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Meaning that companies will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC 718 and forgo revaluing the award after this date. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 on August 6, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Substantial Doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of general and administrative expenses. Our consolidated federal tax return and any state tax returns are not currently under examination.
The Company has adopted FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued as a new Topic, ASC Topic 606. The new revenue recognition standard supersedes all existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14, issued in August 2015, deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017.
In February 2016, FASB issued ASC 842 that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The update, which supersedes existing lease guidance, will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with the classification determining the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
The ASU will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is applicable on a modified retrospective basis with various optional practical expedients. The Company has assessed the impact of this standard. The Company entered into a new lease agreement commencing on November 1, 2019 and implemented this guidance on November 1, 2019.
In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This update addresses a diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
On June 20, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to nonemployees (for example, service providers, external legal counsel, suppliers, etc.). Under the new standard, companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Meaning that companies will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC 718 and forgo revaluing the award after this date. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 on August 6, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 3 - JOINT VENTURE
On May 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Agreement”) with XTI Aircraft Company (“XTI”), a Delaware corporation, to form a new company, called Eco-Aero, LLC (the “JV”), a Delaware limited liability company, with the purpose of completing the preliminary design of XTI’s TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric, vertical takeoff, and landing (eVTOL) fixed wing aircraft. Under the Agreement, Xeriant is contributing capital, technology, and strategic business relationships, and XTI is contributing intellectual property licensing rights and know-how. XTI and the Company each own 50 percent of the JV. The JV is managed by a management committee consisting of five members, three appointed by the Company and two by XTI. The Agreement was effective on June 4, 2021, with an initial deposit of $1 million into the JV. Xeriant’s financial commitment is $10 million, contributed over a period of less than one year, as required by the aircraft development timeline and budget.
The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from Xeriant. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50. However, the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Three of the five members are from Xeriant. Additionally, Xeriant has an obligation to invest $10,000,000 into the JV. As such, Xeriant has substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that Xeriant is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant will consolidate the VIE.
NOTE 4 - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS
The Company maintains accounts with financial institutions. All cash in checking accounts is non-interest bearing and is fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At times, cash balances may exceed the maximum coverage provided by the FDIC on insured depositor accounts. The Company believes it mitigates its risk by depositing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. On June 30, 2021, the Company had $712,540 in excess of FDIC insurance.
NOTE 5 - OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY
The Company leases 2,911 square feet of office space located in the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University, Innovation Centre 1, 3998 FAU Boulevard, Suite 309, Boca Raton, Florida. The Company entered into a lease agreement commencing on November 1, 2019 through January 1, 2025 in which the first three months of rent were abated. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company decided to have all employees work from home and intends to build out the office space by the end of 2021 to allow employees to work from the office in January of 2022. The following table illustrates the base rent amounts over the term of the lease:
Operating lease right-of-use asset and liability are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value is our incremental borrowing rate, estimated to be 10%, as the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Since the common area maintenance expenses are expenses that do not depend on an index or rate, they are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and recognized in other general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations. At inception the Company paid prepaid rent in the amount of $4,659, which was netted against the operating lease right-of-use asset balance until it was applied in February 2020.
Right-of-use asset is summarized below:
Operating lease liability is summarized below:
NOTE 6 - EXCHANGE AGREEMENT

NOTE 7 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE (CONTINUED)
The Company evaluated the agreement under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). ASC 815 generally requires the analysis embedded terms and features that have characteristics of derivatives to be evaluated for bifurcation and separate accounting in instances where their economic risks and characteristics are not clearly and closely related to the risks of the host contract. None of the embedded terms required bifurcation and liability classification. However, the Company was required to determine if the debt contained a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”), which is based on the intrinsic value on the date of issuance. The Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of $342,950 related to these notes. Additionally, for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company recorded $19,368 and $323,582 in amortization of debt discount related to the BCF, respectively.

NOTE 11 - GOING CONCERN MATTERS
The Company's financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $962,540 and $38,893 in cash and $677,257 in working capital and $53,532 in negative working capital, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a net loss of $2,702,602 and $699,564, respectively. Continued losses may adversely affect the liquidity of the Company in the future. Therefore, the factors noted above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing and to succeed in its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s existence is dependent upon management’s ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems.
NOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the significant components of the deferred tax assets are summarized below:
Income tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income consist of the following for 2021 and 2020:
The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and adjusts the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance to the extent the future realization of the deferred tax assets is not judged to be more likely than not. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of its deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income or loss, the carryforward periods available to the Company for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.
Future changes in the unrecognized tax benefit will have no impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit will not change significantly within the next twelve months. The Company will continue to classify income tax penalties and interest as part of general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of operations. There were no interest or penalties accrued as of June 30, 2021.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Registrant files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures must ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial and other required disclosures.
At June 30, 2021, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Keith Duffy our Chief Executive Officer and Brian Carey our Chief Financial Officer. Based on his evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, he concluded that at June 30, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting discussed directly below.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; (iii) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and (iv) provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions may occur or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Keith Duffy our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. This evaluation was based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon such assessment, Keith Duffy concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our material weaknesses relate to the following:
·
Lack of a full-time Chief Financial Officer. We do not have a dedicated full-time Chief Financial Officer in charge of our financial reporting. Financial reporting is performed by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Keith Duffy. Mr. Duffy does not possess accounting expertise.
·
Lack of formal review process. We do not possess a formal, multi-level process with respect to our financial reporting.
·
Ineffective oversight. We do not have an audit committee comprised of independent directors to oversee our financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting.
These weaknesses are due to the Company's historical lack of working capital to hire a full-time, dedicated Chief Financial Officer. The Company plans to hire a full-time Chief Financial Officer. Further, the Company intends to appoint additional Directors and form an audit committee comprised of independent directors.
This Report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission do not require an attestation of the Management's report by our registered public accounting firm in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Director Independence
We are not currently a “listed company” under SEC rules and are therefore not required to have a Board comprised of a majority of independent directors or separate committees comprised of independent directors.
Director Independence; Standing Committees
The Company has two independent directors serving on its Board of Directors, including Michael Harper and Lisa Ruth, as defined under the Nasdaq Stock Market’s listing standards, effective they joined the Board of Directors in May 2021 upon reconstitution of the Board as described in this Information Statement.
The Company’s common stock is traded on OTCQB under the symbol “XERI.” The OTCQB trading platform does not maintain any standards regarding the “independence” of the directors for our Board of Directors, and we are not otherwise subject to the requirements of any national securities exchange or an inter-dealer quotation system with respect to the need to have a majority of our directors be independent.
The Company’s Board presently has no functioning standing committees.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Although we have not adopted a formal policy on whether the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be separate or combined, we have traditionally determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to combine these roles due to the small size and early stage of the Company
Family Relationships
Keith Duffy, Chairman and CEO, and Scott Duffy, Executive Director, are brothers.
Board Committees
Audit Committee
We do not have a separately designated audit committee of the board. Audit committee functions are performed by our board of directors. None of our directors are deemed independent. Two directors also hold positions as our officers. Our Board of Directors is responsible for: (1) selection and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; (3) establishing procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by our employees of concerns regarding accounting and auditing matters; (4) engaging outside advisors; and, (5) funding for the outside auditory and any outside advisors engagement by the audit committee.
Nominees
There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Registrant's board.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC reports of their holdings of, and transactions in, our common stock. Based solely upon our review of copies of such reports and written representations from reporting persons that were provided to us, we believe that our officers, directors and 10% stockholders complied with these reporting requirements with respect to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
Code of Ethics
The Registrant has adopted a corporate code of ethics. The Registrant believes its code of ethics is reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in public reports; comply with applicable laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of code violations; and provide accountability for adherence to the code.
Item 11. Executive Compensation.
For the year ended June 30, 2021, no director or executive officer has received compensation from the Registrant pursuant to any compensatory or benefit plan. There is no plan or understanding, express or implied, to pay any compensation to any director or executive officer pursuant to any compensatory or benefit plan, although we anticipate that we will compensate our officers and directors for services to us with stock or options to purchase stock, in lieu of cash.
Executive Compensation Policies as They Relate to Risk Management
Management have considered whether our compensation policies might encourage inappropriate risk taking by the Company's executive officers and other employees. The Compensation Committee has determined that the current compensation structure aligns the interests of the executive officers with those of the Company without providing rewards for excessive risk taking by awarding a mix of fixed and performance based or discretionary bonuses with the performance-based compensation focused on profits as opposed to revenue growth.
Option Exercises and Fiscal Year-End Option Value Table
None of the named executive officers exercised any stock options during the year ended June 30, 2021 or held any outstanding stock options as of June 30, 2021.
Incentive Plan

Consulting Agreements
None, although some of the officers are currently paid as consultants of the Company.
Director Compensation
Edward DeFeudis, one of the Company’s Directors, was compensated $38,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 because of the amount of involvement in assisting management of the Company.
