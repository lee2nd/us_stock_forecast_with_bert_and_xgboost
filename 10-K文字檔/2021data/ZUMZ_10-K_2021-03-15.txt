Item 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in “Item 1A Risk Factors.” See the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements set forth at the beginning of Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Fiscal 2020-A Review of This Past Year
Fiscal 2020 presented unprecedented challenges for retailers with significant impacts on customers and employees, long periods of store closures and operating restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Coming off of the strongest earnings in our history in fiscal 2019, we had positive momentum entering the first quarter of 2020. In early March, however, we began to feel the impacts of COVID-19 which resulted in significantly reduced traffic and ultimately store closures across virtually all of the geographies in which we operate. During this time our focus remained centered on the customer with our teams working diligently to drive digital volume and maximize our localized fulfillment platform, while also working across the business to minimize expenses, preserve financial liquidity and maintain financial flexibility. Actions taken included suspending hiring, laying off the majority of our part time staff, lowering operating costs including travel and other non-essential items, reducing capital spend by delaying projects, reducing planned inventory receipts, suspending rent payments, extending payment terms with our vendors and pausing our share repurchase program. As we moved into the second quarter we started to open the majority of our stores and experienced higher than expected revenue driven by the efforts of our sales teams to connect with customers and take advantage of pent up demand from lockdowns. We also benefited from a reduction in competition for discretionary spending given that many options, such as travel and entertainment, were unavailable or significantly restricted. Sales through the second quarter and ultimately back half of the year were in excess of expectations despite rolling store short-term closures, wide-spread operating restrictions, supply chain delays, a curtailed back to school as most students were attending virtually, capacity restrictions in peaks, lack of tourism and numerous other impacts to our business.
Overall, COVID-19 did have a meaningful, negative impact on the business as total sales were down 4.2% for the full year. All categories, other than hardgoods, were down in total sales. Though total net sales were down for the year, operating margins increased 150 basis points from the fiscal 2019 on top of an improvement of 210 basis points in fiscal 2019. These gains translated to $3.00 of diluted earnings per share, up from $2.62 in the prior year and represented the most profitable year in the history of our company. Overall fiscal 2020 earnings improvements were driven by significant gains in product margins, strong expense management, occupancy abatements and government credits primarily related to payroll that were able to offset the impacts of decreased sales. We added 3 new stores in North America in fiscal 2020, down from 6 new stores added in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020, we also added 7 new Blue Tomato stores in Europe and 2 new Fast Times store in Australia and continue to have meaningful expansion opportunities in these areas.
As a leading global lifestyle retailer, we continue to differentiate ourselves through our distinctive brand offering and diverse product selection, as well as the unique customer experience across all of our platforms. We remain committed to serving the customer launching over 100 new brands in 2020. We have made investments over several years to integrate the digital and physical channels creating a seamless shopping experience for our customer and one channel expense structure which we believe was a critical asset in 2020 as more demand shifted to the digital channels in response to store closures. We are continuing to deliver almost all of our online orders in North America from our stores, which has provided significant improvements in the speed of delivery to our customers. Internationally we continue to see deeper penetration of localized fulfillment and are in various stages of roll-out in different countries. In-store fulfillment is a key part of strategy that we believe will drive long term market share by leveraging the strengths of our store sales team, providing better and faster service to customers, improving product margins, maximizing the productivity of inventory, providing additional selling opportunities, and utilizing one cost structure to serve the customer.
The following table shows net sales, operating profit, operating margin and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019:
(1)
The decrease in net sales was primarily due to widespread short-term store closures globally throughout the fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a 13.6% comparable sales increase and the net addition of 3 stores (12 new stores offset by 9 store closures). The increase in comparable sales was driven by an increase in transactions and an increase in dollars per transaction. Dollars per transaction increased due to an increase in units per transaction and average unit retail.
Fiscal 2021-A Look At the Upcoming Year
We are entering fiscal 2021 having just come off an incredibly challenging year that resulted in our sales decreasing 4.2%, while still recording the strongest earnings in the history of our company. We are currently planning 2021 with the expectation that we will continue to experience many of the challenges that impacted us in 2020, but with fewer store closures and restrictions as we move through the year. Given the cadence of 2020, we are expecting the first quarter to be significantly stronger than 2020 while the second quarter and various elements of the back half of the year will be more challenging based on the increased competition for discretionary dollars and timing of normalized operational costs, including store payroll, travel, marketing events, and training, as overall COVID restrictions are reduced.
In fiscal 2021, our focus remains on serving the customer with strategic investments largely focused on enhancing the customer experience while increasing market share and creating operational efficiencies to drive operating margin expansion. Given our significant cash position, we have the security to manage through potential difficulties while also investing strategically in important long-term initiatives. As we are within our targeted store count range in North America, we expect that store count will be roughly flat in the region. In Europe and Australia, however, we continue to believe we have growth opportunities and we are planning 22 new stores during fiscal 2021, up from 9 in 2020.
In fiscal 2021, considering our anticipated growth rate inclusive of the recapture of lost sales from store closures in 2020, we expect that we will be able to grow operating margins for the full year compared to fiscal 2020. It is important to note that we will also be looking to reintroduce costs that were cut in 2020 due to their importance to our long-term strategy, culture, and brand. These costs will include many training and marketing related events that we were unable to execute in 2020 due to travel and other restrictions, department travel to connect our people and increased store hours as malls around the world move back to normal operations. Our year-end fiscal 2020 inventory was down 0.5% from year-end fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2021, we anticipate inventory levels per square foot will grow slower than sales on the year as we apply learnings from 2020 to further increase inventory turns. Excluding any potential share buy-backs under the currently authorized program, we expect cash, short-term investments and working capital to increase, and do not anticipate any new long-term borrowings during the year. Long-term, we aim to grow sales annually and grow operating profit at a faster rate than sales by focusing on the changing consumer environment while managing our cost structure.
General
Net sales constitute gross sales, net of actual and estimated returns and deductions for promotions, and shipping revenue. Net sales include our store sales and our ecommerce sales. We record the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognize revenue when a customer redeems a gift card. Additionally, the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed (“gift card breakage”) is recognized based on our historical redemption rate in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer.
We report “comparable sales” based on net sales beginning on the first anniversary of the first day of operation of a new store or ecommerce business. We operate a sales strategy that integrates our stores with our ecommerce platform. There is significant interaction between our store sales and our ecommerce sales channels and we believe that they are utilized in tandem to serve our customers. Therefore, our comparable sales also include our ecommerce sales. Changes in our comparable sales between two periods are based on net sales of store or ecommerce business which were in operation during both of the two periods being compared and, if a store or ecommerce business is included in the calculation of comparable sales for only a portion of one of the two periods being compared, then that store or ecommerce business is included in the calculation for only the comparable portion of the other period. Any increase or decrease less than 25% in square footage of an existing comparable store, including remodels and relocations within the same mall, or temporary closures less than seven days does not eliminate that store from inclusion in the calculation of comparable sales. Any store or ecommerce business that we acquire will be included in the calculation of comparable sales after the first anniversary of the acquisition date. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year comparable sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. Stores closed due the impacts of COVID-19 are excluded from our comparable sales calculation if they were closed for longer than seven days. Our ecommerce business has remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore remains reported in our comparable sales calculation. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other apparel retailers calculate comparable sales. As a result, data herein regarding our comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers.
Cost of goods sold consists of branded merchandise costs and our private label merchandise costs including design, sourcing, importing and inbound freight costs. Our cost of goods sold also includes shrinkage, buying, occupancy, ecommerce fulfillment, distribution and warehousing costs (including associated depreciation) and freight costs for store merchandise transfers. This may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of goods sold. Cash consideration received from vendors is reported as a reduction of cost of goods sold if the inventory has sold, a reduction of the carrying value of the inventory if the inventory is still on hand, or a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense if the amounts are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs of selling the vendors’ products.
With respect to the freight component of our ecommerce sales, amounts billed to our customers are included in net sales and the related freight cost is charged to cost of goods sold.
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of store personnel wages and benefits, administrative staff and infrastructure expenses, freight costs for merchandise shipments from the distribution centers to the stores, store supplies, depreciation on fixed assets at our home office and stores, facility expenses, training expenses and advertising and marketing costs. Credit card fees, insurance, public company expenses, legal expenses, amortization of intangibles, and other miscellaneous operating costs are also included in selling, general and administrative expenses. This may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.
Key Performance Indicators
Our management evaluates the following items, which we consider key performance indicators, in assessing our performance:
Net sales. Net sales constitute gross sales, net of sales returns and deductions for promotions, and shipping revenue. Net sales includes comparable sales and new store sales for all our store and ecommerce businesses. We consider net sales to be an important indicator of our current performance. Net sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs, including store payroll and store occupancy. Net sales also have a direct impact on our operating profit, cash and working capital.
Gross profit. Gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise. Gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations.
Operating profit. We view operating profit as a key indicator of our success. Operating profit is the difference between gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses. The key drivers of operating profit are net sales, gross profit, our ability to control selling, general and administrative expenses and our level of capital expenditures affecting depreciation expense.
Diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period. We view diluted earnings per share as a key indicator of our success in increasing shareholder value.
Results of Operations
In December 2019, a novel stain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In the best interest of our customers and employees and in line with governmental regulations, all stores were closed by March 19, 2020. We began gradually re-opening physical stores at the end of the first fiscal quarter and into the second fiscal quarter, with the majority of our stores open through the third and fourth quarter. The impacts of COVID-19 have significantly impacted the financial results of our business during fiscal 2020 resulting in our stores being open approximately 78.4% of the possible days during the year. By quarter, our stores were open, on an aggregate basis, approximately 50.2%, 73.4%, 94.7% and 93.6%, respectively, of the possible days during each fiscal quarter.
The following table presents selected items on the consolidated statements of income as a percent of net sales:
Fiscal 2020 Results Compared With Fiscal 2019
Net Sales
Net sales were $990.7 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $1,034.1 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $43.4 million or 4.2%. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the closure of our physical retail globally due to the impact of COVID-19. For the year, our stores were open approximately 78.4% of the possible days. This decrease was partially offset by a 13.6% increase in comparable sales driven by the increase in ecommerce sales as well as the strong performance of our physical stores upon re-opening.
The 13.6% increase in comparable sales was primarily driven by an increase in comparable transactions and an increase in dollars per transaction. Dollars per transaction increased due to an increase in average unit retail and units per transaction. Comparable sales were primarily driven by an increase in hardgoods followed by men’s clothing, accessories, and women’s clothing partially offset by a decrease in footwear. For information as to how we define comparable sales, see “General” above.
By region, North America sales decreased $48.7 million or 5.3% and other international sales increased $5.3 million or 4.4% during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Net sales for the year ended January 30, 2021 included a $4.6 million increase due to the change in foreign exchange rates, which consisted of $4.3 million in Europe, $0.5 million in Australia offset by a $0.2 million decrease in Canada. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, North America sales decreased $48.5 million or 5.3% and other international sales increased $0.5 million or 0.3% during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $350.0 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $366.6 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $16.6 million, or 4.5%. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased 10 basis points in fiscal 2020 to 35.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by a 120 basis point increase in web fulfillment and shipping costs due to increased web activity as a result of COVID-19, however leveraged to the prior year when compared to total shipped sales and a 30 basis point increase due to the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets. This was partially offset by an 80 basis point decrease in inventory shrinkage and a 70 basis point increase in product margin.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $253.1 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $280.8 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $27.7 million, or 9.9%. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 160 basis points in fiscal 2020 to 25.5%. The decrease was primarily driven by a 70 basis point decrease due to governmental credits, a 60 basis point decrease in store wages, a 30 basis point decrease in national training and recognition events and a 20 basis point decrease in corporate costs.
Net Income
Net income for fiscal 2020 was $76.2 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, compared with net income of $66.9 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, for fiscal 2019. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 25.6% compared to 26.5% for fiscal 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily related to a reduction in net losses in certain jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to the realization of deferred tax assets and the proportion of earnings or loss before income taxes across jurisdictions.
Fiscal 2019 Results Compared With Fiscal 2018
Net Sales
Net sales were $1,034.1 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $978.6 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $55.5 million or 5.7%. The increase reflected a $47.2 million increase due to comparable sales and a $10.8 million increase due to the net addition of 11 stores (made up of 6 new stores in North America, 7 new stores in Europe, and 3 new stores in Australia offset by 5 store closures). By region, North America sales increased $44.9 million or 5.2% and other international sales increased $10.6 million or 9.7% during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Net sales for the year ended February 1, 2020 included $6.4 million decrease due to the change in foreign exchange rates, which consisted of $0.7 million in Canada, $5.1 million in Europe and $0.6 million in Australia.
The 4.9% increase in comparable sales was primarily driven by an increase in comparable transactions and an increase in dollars per transaction. Dollars per transaction increased due to an increase in average unit retail and units per transaction. Comparable sales were primarily driven by an increase in hardgoods followed by footwear, and accessories partially offset by decreases in women’s and men’s clothing. For information as to how we define comparable sales, see “General” above.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $366.6 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $335.9 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $30.7 million, or 9.1%. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased 110 basis points in fiscal 2019 to 35.4%. The increase was primarily driven by 40 basis points of leverage in our store occupancy costs, 30 basis points due to improved inventory management and lower inventory shrinkage, 30 basis points related to distribution center, fulfillment and shipping, and 10 basis points due to higher product margin.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $280.8 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $274.9 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $5.9 million, or 2.1%. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 100 basis points in fiscal 2019 to 27.1%. The decrease was primarily driven by 80 basis points impact of leverage in our store costs and 20 basis points in impairment on fixed assets.
Net Income
Net income for fiscal 2019 was $66.9 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared with net income of $45.2 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, for fiscal 2018. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 26.5% compared to 27.5% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily related to a reduction in net losses in certain jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to the realization of deferred tax assets and the proportion of earnings or loss before income taxes across jurisdictions.
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
As is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise, our business is subject to seasonal influences. As a result, we have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating results. Our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, while the back-to-school and winter holiday periods in our third and fourth fiscal quarters historically have accounted for the largest percentage of our annual net sales. Quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores, fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences, calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods, changes in merchandise mix, timing of promotional events, general economic conditions, competition and weather conditions. Fiscal 2020 was further impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and the impacts of closures and reduced operating hours across the year.
The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data. The unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and includes all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. This information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The operating results for any fiscal quarter are not indicative of the operating results for a full fiscal year or for any future period and there can be no assurance that any trend reflected in such results will continue in the future.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary uses of cash are for operational expenditures, inventory purchases and capital investments, including new stores, store remodels, store relocations, store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements. Additionally, we may use cash for the repurchase of our common stock. Historically, our main source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations.
The significant components of our working capital are inventories and liquid assets such as cash, cash equivalents, current marketable securities and receivables, reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale, while we typically have longer payment terms with our vendors.
At January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities were $375.5 million and $251.2 million. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $339.8 million at the end of fiscal 2020, an increase of 34.4% from $252.9 million at the end of fiscal 2019. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities in fiscal 2020 was due primarily to cash provided by operating activities of $138.4 million, partially offset by $9.1 million of capital expenditures primarily related to the opening of 12 new stores and 3 remodels and relocations.
The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $32.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $138.4 million from $106.1 million in fiscal 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $40.7 million in fiscal 2019 to $106.1 million from $65.4 million in fiscal 2018. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for inventory, employee compensation, store occupancy expenses and other operational expenditures. Net cash from operating activities increase included cash deferment of $30.1 million composed of lower inventory levels, landlord payments, extended vendor payment terms, and payroll tax payments as well as net income improvements related to abatements, credits and expense reductions. Cash received from our customers generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards or cash to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income, which is impacted by changes to non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, deferred taxes, and changes to the components of working capital.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $110.5 million in fiscal 2020 related to $101.4 million in net purchases of marketable securities and $9.1 million of capital expenditures primarily for new store openings and existing store remodels or relocations. Net cash used in investing activities was $102.9 million in fiscal 2019 related to $18.8 million of capital expenditures primarily for new store openings and existing store remodels or relocations and $84.1 million in net purchases of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $36.4 million in fiscal 2018 related to $21.0 million of capital expenditures primarily for new store openings and existing store remodels or relocations and $15.4 million in net purchases of marketable securities.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 was $9.7 million related to $13.4 million used in the repurchase of common stock and $0.2 million in payments for tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock partially offset by $3.9 million in proceeds from the issuance and exercise of stock-based awards. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2019 was $2.0 million related to $2.3 million in proceeds from issuance of stock-based awards partially offset by $0.3 million in payments on tax withholding obligation upon vesting of restricted stock. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $0.1 million related to $0.9 million in proceeds from issuance of stock-based awards partially offset by $0.2 million in payments on tax withholding obligation upon vesting of restricted stock and $0.5 million of net payments on revolving credit facilities.
Sources of Liquidity
Our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds generated by operating activities and available cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities. We expect these sources of liquidity and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash requirements for operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. Beyond this time frame, if cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. However, there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current shareholders.
As of January 30, 2021, we maintained a secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which provided us with a senior secured credit facility (“credit facility”) of up to $35.0 million. The credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility provides for the issuance of standby letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $17.5 million outstanding at any time and with a term not to exceed 365 days. The commercial line of credit provides for the issuance of commercial letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $10.0 million and with terms not to exceed 120 days. The credit facility will mature on December 7, 2021. The credit facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property (but not the real property) of the borrowers and guarantors. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.25% per annum. There were no borrowings or open commercial letters of credit outstanding under the secured credit facility at January 30, 2021.
Additionally, on October 12, 2020, we entered into a credit facility with UBS Switzerland AG of up to 15.0 million Euro ($18.2 million), which may be used to guarantee payment of letters of credit. The credit facility bears interest at 1.25%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at January 30, 2021.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital requirements include construction and fixture costs related to the opening of new stores and remodel and relocation expenditures for existing stores. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of new store openings, the availability of suitable locations for new stores and the nature of arrangements negotiated with landlords. In that regard, our net investment to open a new store has varied significantly in the past due to a number of factors, including the geographic location and size of the new store, and is likely to vary significantly in the future.
During fiscal 2020, we spent $9.1 million on capital expenditures, which consisted of $6.6 million of costs related to investment in 12 new stores and 3 remodeled or relocated stores, $2.1 million associated with improvements to our websites and $0.4 million in other improvements.
During fiscal 2019, we spent $18.8 million on capital expenditures, which consisted of $13.7 million of costs related to investment in 16 new stores and 17 remodeled or relocated stores, $1.2 million associated with improvements to our websites and the Customer Engagement Suite and $3.9 million in other improvements.
During fiscal 2018, we spent $21.0 million on capital expenditures, which consisted of $15.6 million of costs related to investment in 9 new stores and 23 remodeled or relocated stores, $2.5 million associated with improvements to our websites and the Customer Engagement Suite and $2.9 million in other improvements.
In fiscal 2021, we expect to spend approximately $20 million to $22 million on capital expenditures, a majority of which will relate to leasehold improvements and fixtures for the approximately 22 new stores we plan to open in fiscal 2021 and remodels or relocations of existing stores. There can be no assurance that the number of stores that we actually open in fiscal 2021 will not be different from the number of stores we plan to open, or that actual fiscal 2021 capital expenditures will not differ from this expected amount.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found in Part IV Item 15 of this Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Description
Judgments and Uncertainties
Effect If Actual Results Differ
From Assumptions
Valuation of Merchandise Inventories
We value our inventory at the lower of average cost or net realizable value through the establishment of write-down and inventory loss reserves.
Our write-down reserve represents the excess of the carrying value over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sales or other disposal of the inventory. Write-downs establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded write-downs or an increase in that newly established cost basis.
Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (“shrinkage reserve”) that have occurred since the last physical inventory.
Our write-down reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on the current rate of sales, the age and profitability of inventory and other factors.
Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical percentages that can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our write-down and shrinkage reserves in the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates we use to calculate our inventory reserves. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% decrease in the sales price of our inventory at January 30, 2021 would have decreased net income by less than $0.1 million in fiscal 2020.
A 10% increase in actual physical inventory shrinkage rate at January 30, 2021 would have decreased net income by $0.1 million in fiscal 2020.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to the asset carrying value. The fair value of the asset is based on the future discounted cash flow of current market rents that we could receive as sublease income.
Events that may result in an impairment include the decision to close a store or facility or a significant decrease in the operating performance of a long-lived asset group. Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting future sales, gross profit, operating expenses, or sub-lease income. In addition to historical results, current trends and initiatives, and long-term macro-economic and industry factors are qualitatively considered. Additionally, management seeks input from store operations related to local economic conditions, including the impact of closures of selected co-tenants who occupy the mall.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, our operating results could be adversely affected. Declines in projected cash flow of the assets could result in impairment.

Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities
We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception. Our operating leases primarily consist of retail store locations, distribution centers and corporate office space. We do not have any material leases, individually or in the aggregate, classified as a finance leasing arrangement.
Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, net of lease incentives received and initial direct costs paid. Our retail store leases are generally for an initial period of 5-10 years, with some of our international leases structured to include renewal options at our election. We include renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise in the measurement our lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.
Significant judgment is required in determining our incremental borrowing rate and the expected lease term, both of which impact the determination of lease classification and the present value of lease payments. Generally, our lease contracts do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate and, therefore, we use an estimated incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The estimated incremental borrowing rate reflects considerations such as market rates for our outstanding collateralized debt and interpolations of rates for leases with terms that differ from our outstanding debt.
Our lease terms include option periods to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised, which is generally through an initial period of 5-10 years.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Given the significant operating lease assets and liabilities recorded, changes in the estimates made by management or the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon purchase at our retail store locations. For our ecommerce sales, revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of sales returns and deductions for promotions.
Revenue is not recorded on the sale of gift cards. We record the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognize revenue when a customer redeems a gift card. Additionally, the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed (“gift card breakage”) is recognized in proportion of the patterns used by the customer based on our historical redemption patterns.
Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions regarding future sales returns and the amount and timing of gift cards projected to be redeemed by gift card recipients. Our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns and gift cards to be redeemed is based primarily on historical experience.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to measure future sales returns in the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% increase in our sales return reserve at January 30, 2021 would have decreased net income by $0.3 million in fiscal 2020.

Accounting for Income Taxes
As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included on the consolidated balance sheets. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal, state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available to us. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount that we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates.
The assessment of whether we will realize the value of our deferred tax assets requires estimates and judgments related to amount and timing of future taxable income. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Additionally, changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations may adversely affect financial results.
Although management believes that the income tax related judgments and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
At January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we had valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets of $8.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively. Significant changes in performance or estimated taxable income may result in a change in our assessment of the valuation allowance.
Upon income tax audit, any unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
Accounting for Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable), or if an estimate is not determinable, we provide disclosure of a material claim or contingency.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our claims and contingencies, including determining the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. The estimated accruals for claims and contingencies are made based on the best information available, which can be highly subjective.
Although management believes that the contingency related judgments and estimates are reasonable, our accrual for claims and contingencies could fluctuate as additional information becomes known, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Additionally, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. We perform this analysis at the reporting unit level.
We have an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we choose not to perform the qualitative test or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value, which is based on the perspective of a market-participant. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the amount in which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests require management to make assumptions and judgments.
Our quantitative goodwill analysis of fair value is determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. Key assumptions in the income approach include estimating future cash flows, long-term growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. Our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, operating performance and our business strategies. Key assumptions in the market approach include identifying companies and transactions with comparable business factors, such as earnings growth, profitability, business and financial risk.
The fair value of the trade names and trademarks is determined using the relief from royalty method, which requires assumptions including forecasting future sales, discount rates and royalty rates.
Based on the results of our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, no impairment was recorded. All reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of the carrying value. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, or there are significant changes in any of these estimates, projections and assumptions, could have a material effect of the fair value of these assets in future measurement periods and result in an impairment, which could materially affect our results of operations.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during fiscal 2020. The following table summarizes the total amount of future payments due under our contractual obligations at January 30, 2021 (in thousands):
(1)
Amounts do not include contingent rent, common area maintenance charges and other non-lease component obligations. See Note 10, “Leases,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found in Part IV Item 15 of the Form 10-K, for additional information related to our operating leases.
(2)
We have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment, except for certain private label, packaging supplies and international purchase orders in which we are obligated to repay contractual amounts upon cancellation.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At January 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
Impact of Inflation/Deflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales or operating results for the past three fiscal years. However, substantial increases in costs, including the price of raw materials, labor, energy and other inputs used in the production of our merchandise or the potential change in regulatory environment, could have a significant impact on our business and the industry in the future. Additionally, while deflation could positively impact our merchandise costs, it could have an adverse effect on our average unit retail price, resulting in lower sales and operating results.
