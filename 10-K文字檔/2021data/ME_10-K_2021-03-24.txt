Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on February 19, 2020 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful.
Recent Developments
On February 4, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with by and among us, VGAC Merger Sub, and 23andMe. The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the following transactions on the closing date: (i) the Domestication and, in connection with the Domestication, (A) VGAC’s name will be changed to “23andMe Holding Co.,” (B) each then-issued and outstanding Class A ordinary share of VGAC will convert automatically into one share of New 23andMe Class A Common Stock, (C) each then-issued and outstanding Class B ordinary share of VGAC will convert automatically into one share of New 23andMe Class A Common Stock, and (D) each then-issued and outstanding common warrant of VGAC will convert automatically into one warrant to purchase one share of New 23andMe Class A Common Stock; and (ii) following the Domestication, VGAC Merger Sub will merge with and into 23andMe, with 23andMe as the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of VGAC.
In connection with the Business Combination, VGAC will adopt a dual class stock structure pursuant to which (i) all stockholders of VGAC, other than the existing holders of 23andMe Class B common stock and 23andMe preferred stock, will hold shares of New 23andMe Class A Common Stock, which will have one vote per share, and (ii) the existing holders of 23andMe Class B common stock and 23andMe preferred stock will hold shares of Class B common stock of VGAC (the “New 23andMe Class B Common Stock”), which will have 10 votes per share. The New 23andMe Class B Common Stock will be subject to conversion to New 23andMe Class A Common Stock upon any transfers of New 23andMe Class B Common Stock (except for certain permitted transfers).
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, based on an implied equity value of $3.6 billion, (i) each share of 23andMe Class A common stock (other than dissenting shares) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration comprised of New 23andMe Class A Common Stock, as determined in the Merger Agreement (the “Share Conversion Ratio”), (ii) each share of 23andMe Class B common stock (other than dissenting shares) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration comprised of New 23andMe Class B Common Stock, as determined pursuant to the Share Conversion Ratio, (iii) each share of 23andMe preferred stock will be converted into shares of 23andMe Class B common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger and such shares of 23andMe Class B common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration comprised of New 23andMe Class B Common Stock, as determined in the Merger Agreement, (iv) vested options of 23andMe will convert into a number of shares of 23andMe Class A common stock determined in accordance with the Share Conversion Ratio, net of shares withheld to pay the applicable exercise price and tax withholding, or in certain limited cases, be assumed by VGAC and converted into comparable options that are exercisable for shares of New 23andMe Class A Common Stock, with a value determined in accordance with the Share Conversion Ratio, and (v) unvested options of 23andMe will be assumed by VGAC and converted into comparable options that are exercisable for shares of New 23andMe Class A Common Stock, with a value determined in accordance with the Share Conversion Ratio.
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of each of the parties thereto that are customary for transactions of this type. VGAC and 23andMe have also agreed to take all necessary action such that, effective immediately after the closing of the Business Combination, the VGAC board of directors (the “Board”) shall consist of nine directors, of whom one individual shall be designated by VGAC, with the remaining eight individuals designated by 23andMe. In addition, VGAC has agreed to adopt an equity incentive plan in an amount not to exceed 17% of VGAC’s equity interests on a fully-diluted basis with an annual evergreen provision in an amount not to exceed 3% on a fully-diluted basis
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through December 31, 2020 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the Initial Public Offering. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination.
For the period from February 19, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $53,732, which consisted of operating expenses of $149,081, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $95,349.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On October 6, 2020, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 48,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $480,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 7,733,333 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant generating gross proceeds of $11,600,000.
On October 16, 2020, in connection with the underwriters’ election to partially exercise of their over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of an additional 2,855,000 Units and the sale of an additional 380,666 Private Placement Warrants, generating total gross proceeds of $29,121,000.
Following the Initial Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and the underwriters election to partially exercise their over-allotment option on October 16, 2020, a total of $508,550,000 was placed in the Trust Account, and we had $1,524,449 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering, and available for working capital purposes. We incurred $28,641,284 in transaction costs, including $10,171,000 of underwriting fees, $17,799,250 of deferred underwriting fees and $671,034 of other offering costs.
For the period from February 19, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $556,234. Net loss of $53,732 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities of $95,349, formation and operating costs paid through promissory note of $10,031 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $417,184 of cash from operating activities.
At December 31, 2020, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $508,645,349. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions, to complete our Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
At December 31, 2020, we had cash of $787,701 held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.
We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services, provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on October 1, 2020 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination and the Company’s liquidation.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $17,999,250 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies.
Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ equity section of our balance sheet.
Net Income (Loss) per Ordinary Share
We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net income per ordinary share, basic and diluted for Class A redeemable ordinary shares is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account by the weighted average number of Class A redeemable ordinary shares outstanding since original issuance. Net loss per ordinary share, basic and diluted for Class B non-redeemable ordinary shares is calculated by dividing the net income (loss), less income attributable to Class A redeemable ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of Class B non-redeemable ordinary shares outstanding for the periods presented.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
