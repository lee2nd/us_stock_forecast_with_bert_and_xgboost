ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
All statements in this section, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. The following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Business Update
The outbreak of COVID-19 and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 have resulted in significant economic disruption globally. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe.
This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity, including a dramatic reduction in airline flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use. As a result, there has been a decline in the demand for the refined petroleum products that we manufacture and sell, which coupled with a decline in the price of crude oil for most of 2020 resulted in a significant decrease in the price and volume of our production and sales of refined petroleum products.
During 2020, there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories. In each quarter of 2020, these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market.
We have been and continue to actively respond to the impacts that these matters are having on our business. Our response has focused on establishing three strategic short-term priorities:
Strengthen Competitive Position of Assets
We are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational, financial, and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio. Our goal is that each individual asset generates free-cash-flow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns. With our investments we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio, including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves.
Improve Commercial Performance
We are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions, and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance.
Lower Cost Structure
We are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and driving operational improvements. In response to the pandemic, in March of 2020, we committed to immediately reducing our capital spending and operating expenses. We accomplished our goal of significantly reducing our capital spending levels by over $1.4 billion from our initial 2020 plans. We also reduced our 2020 forecasted operating expenses by more than our target of $950 million.
In connection with these three strategic short-term priorities, in the third quarter of 2020 we announced strategic actions to lay a foundation for long-term success, including plans to optimize our assets and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond. These actions included indefinitely idling the Gallup refinery, initiating actions to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and the approval of an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In addition to these measures to address our operations, throughout the year we took action to address our liquidity as outlined below:
•Share repurchases were temporarily suspended. The timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions.
•On April 27, 2020, we entered into an additional $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which expires in 2021, to provide incremental liquidity and financial flexibility during the commodity price and demand downturn. In February 2021, we elected to terminate this credit agreement as we no longer believe the facility is necessary as an additional source for liquidity, and we do not intend to replace it.
•On April 27, 2020, we closed on the issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes. Proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down certain amounts outstanding on the five-year revolving credit facility.
•During June 2020, we repaid the remaining amounts outstanding on the five-year revolving credit facility.
•On September 23, 2020, we entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement, which provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in September 2021, and which replaced a similar 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired on September 28, 2020.
•At December 31, 2020, we had $6.73 billion available on our variable credit facilities, net of commercial paper borrowings of $1.02 billion.
Many uncertainties remain with respect to COVID-19, including its resulting economic effects, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from COVID-19 and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic ultimately subsides. However, the adverse impact of the economic effects on MPC has been and will likely continue to be significant. We believe we have proactively addressed many of the known impacts of COVID-19 to the extent possible and will strive to continue to do so, but there can be no guarantee the measures will be fully effective.
Other Strategic Updates
The Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable fuels facility began ramping operations at the end of 2020 and is on-track to reach full production by the end of the first quarter of 2021. At full capacity, the facility is expected to produce 184 million gallons per year of renewable diesel from corn and soybean oil. MPC intends to sell the renewable diesel into the California market to comply with the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we also progressed activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers, and beginning detailed engineering activities. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. On February 24, 2021, MPC’s board of directors approved these plans.
On November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of its outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, 1,473,843 MPLX common units were repurchased at an average cost per unit of $22.29. Total cash paid for units repurchased during the year was $33 million and $967 million of repurchase authorization remained outstanding on the program as of December 31, 2020.
Results
Select results for continuing operations for 2020 and 2019 are reflected in the following table.
(a)Includes LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million for 2020.
(b)Reflects corporate costs of $26 million and $28 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, that are no longer allocated to Speedway under discontinued operations accounting.
(c)2020 reflects impairments of goodwill, equity method investments and long-lived assets. 2019 reflects impairments of goodwill and equity method investments.
(d)2020 restructuring expense include $195 million for exit costs related to the Martinez and Gallup refineries and $172 million of employee separation costs.
(e)2020 and 2019 include costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts. 2019 includes employee severance, retention and other costs related to the acquisition of Andeavor. Effective October 1, 2019, we discontinued reporting Andeavor transaction-related costs as one year has passed since the acquisition and these costs are immaterial. Costs incurred in connection with the Speedway separation are included in discontinued operations.
Select results for discontinued operations are reflected in the following table.
(a)As of August 2, 2020, MPC ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway. Asset write-offs and retirement charges, which totaled $7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, are presented as depreciation and amortization in our financial statements. Speedway depreciation and amortization was $244 million and $413 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(b)Costs related to the Speedway separation.
The following table includes net income (loss) per diluted share data.
During 2020, actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction in the areas where we operate which impacted demand for our products. Net income attributable to MPC decreased $12.46 billion, or $19.10 per diluted share, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a loss in our Refining & Marketing segment, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of $8.43 billion and impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion during the period primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices, and restructuring expenses of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction.
The loss from operations in our Refining & Marketing segment is primarily due to decreases in refined product sales volumes, prices and margins during 2020 and includes a charge of $561 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 to reflect a LIFO liquidation for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers which were liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in increased cost of revenues and decreased income from operations. These results were partially offset by increased income from discontinued operations, which relates to Speedway, in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to higher fuel margins partially offset by lower fuel volumes. In addition, as of August 2, 2020, MPC ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional information on discontinued operations.
Refer to the Results of Operations section for a discussion of financial results by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2020.
MPLX
We received limited partner distributions of $1.79 billion and $1.82 billion from MPLX and Andeavor Logistics LP (“ANDX”) during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We owned approximately 647 million MPLX common units at December 31, 2020 with a market value of $14.02 billion based on the December 31, 2020 closing unit price of $21.65. On January 28, 2021, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6875 per common unit, which was paid February 12, 2021. As a result, MPLX made distributions totaling $714 million to its common unitholders. MPC’s portion of this distribution was approximately $445 million.
On July 31, 2020, Western Refining Southwest, Inc. (now known as Western Refining Southwest LLC) (“WRSW”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPC, entered into a Redemption Agreement (the “Redemption Agreement”) with MPLX, pursuant to which MPLX transferred to WRSW all of the outstanding membership interests in Western Refining Wholesale, LLC, (“WRW”) in exchange for the redemption of MPLX common units held by WRSW. The transaction effected the transfer to MPC of the Western wholesale distribution business that MPLX acquired as a result of its acquisition of ANDX. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, the results of these operations are presented in MPC’s Refining & Marketing segment.
At the closing, per the terms of Redemption Agreement, MPLX redeemed 18,582,088 MPLX common units held by WRSW. The number of redeemed units was calculated by dividing WRW’s aggregate valuation of $340 million by the simple average of the volume weighted average New York Stock Exchange prices of an MPLX common unit for the ten trading days ending at market close on July 27, 2020. The transaction resulted in a minor decrease in MPC’s ownership interest in MPLX.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information on MPLX.
Liquidity
Our liquidity, excluding MPLX, totaled $7.3 billion at December 31, 2020 consisting of:
(a)Outstanding borrowings include $1 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility. Excludes MPLX’s $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $175 million borrowings and no of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
(b)In February 2021, we elected to cancel one of the $1.0 B 364-day revolving credit agreements prior to its maturity in April 2021.
(c)Availability under our $750 million trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products.
(d)We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under bank revolving credit facilities.
(e)Includes cash and cash equivalents classified as assets held for sale of $140 million (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5) and excludes $15 million of MPLX cash and cash equivalents.
On November 15, 2020, all of the $650 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 3.400% senior notes due December 2020 were redeemed at a price equal to par.
On October 1, 2020, all of the $475 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due October 2022, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par.
MPLX’s liquidity totaled $4.84 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX had cash and cash equivalents of $15 million, $3.33 billion available under its $3.5 billion revolving credit agreement and $1.5 billion available through its intercompany loan agreement with MPC.
On December 29, 2020, MPLX announced the redemption of all the $750 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due January 2025. The notes were redeemed on January 15, 2021 at a price equal to 102.625% of the principal amount. These notes are included in long-term debt due within one year in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for information on our new bank revolving credit facilities.
OVERVIEW OF SEGMENTS
Refining & Marketing
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing margin, refining operating costs, refining planned turnarounds, distribution costs, depreciation expenses and refinery throughputs. Our total refining capacity was 2,874 mbpcd, 3,067 mbpcd and 3,021 mbpcd as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our Refining & Marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison
with other industry participants, we calculate Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. The following will be used for these crack-spread calculations:
•The Gulf Coast crack spread uses three barrels of LLS crude producing two barrels of USGC CBOB gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD;
•The Mid-Continent crack spread uses three barrels of WTI crude producing two barrels of Chicago CBOB gasoline and one barrel of Chicago ULSD; and
•The West Coast crack spread uses three barrels of ANS crude producing two barrels of LA CARBOB and one barrel of LA CARB Diesel.
Our refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads. The amount of these discounts, which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads. In general, larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our Refining & Marketing margin.
Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.
The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.
(a)Crack spread based on 40 percent LLS, 40 percent WTI and 20 percent ANS with Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast product pricing, respectively, and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.
(b)Sour crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: ANS, Argus Sour Crude Index, Maya and Western Canadian Select. We expect approximately 51 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2021 will be sour crude.
(c)Sweet crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: Bakken, Brent, LLS, WTI-Cushing and WTI-Midland. We expect approximately 49 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2021 will be sweet crude.
(d)This is consumption based exposure for our Refining & Marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our Midstream segment.
In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sour differential and the sweet differential, our Refining & Marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:
•the selling prices realized for refined products;
•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;
•our refinery yields;
•the cost of products purchased for resale;
•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;
•the potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices: and
•the potential impact of LIFO liquidation charges due to draw-downs from historic inventory levels.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the LIFO inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. At December 31, 2020, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no LCM inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs and refining planned turnaround costs in addition to committed distribution costs. Changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Refining planned turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Distribution costs primarily include long-term agreements with MPLX, as discussed below, which are based on committed volumes and will negatively impact income from operations in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled.
The following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years and only reflects the activity for the acquired refineries after October 1, 2018.
We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX. Under these agreements, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our Refining & Marketing segment. Certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. Certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets.
Midstream
Our Midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products, principally for our Refining & Marketing segment. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. The profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. The profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our Refining & Marketing segment.
As discussed above in the Refining & Marketing section, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, has various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment. Under these agreements, MPLX has received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.
Our Midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and NGLs. NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our Midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third-party processing plants, purchasing
and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index-related prices and the cost of third-party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. These amounts include the results of Andeavor from the October 1, 2018 acquisition date forward. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.
Consolidated Results of Operations
(a)In accordance with discontinued operations accounting, Speedway sales to retail customers and net results are reflected in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and Refining & Marketing intercompany sales to Speedway are now presented as third-party sales for all periods presented.
(b)2020 includes $1.32 billion of impairment expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 for further information.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net income (loss) attributable to MPC decreased $12.46 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to impairment expenses for goodwill and long-lived assets of $8.43 billion, impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion, decreased refined product sales volumes, prices and margin, a charge of $561 million to reflect a LIFO liquidation in our crude oil and refined product inventories and restructuring expenses of $367 million. These changes were partially offset by reduced operating costs and increased income from discontinued operations, which represents Speedway. See Segment Results for additional information.
Total revenues and other income decreased $42.83 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:
•decreased sales and other operating revenues of $41.37 billion primarily due to decreased Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, or 14 percent, and lower average refined product sales prices, which decreased $0.55 per gallon, or 31 percent, largely due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic;
•decreased income from equity method investments of $1.25 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices; and
•decreased net gain on disposal of assets of $208 million mainly due to the absence of $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline Pipeline Company LLC (“Capline LLC”) and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019. This decrease was offset by net gains on disposal of assets in 2020 largely due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets.
Total costs and expenses decreased $26.12 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:
•decreased cost of revenues of $33.50 billion primarily due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $561 million to reflect LIFO liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in the LIFO liquidation charge;
•impairment expense of $8.43 billion recorded in 2020 for goodwill and long-lived assets of $7.39 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices. It also includes impairment of long-lived assets primarily related to the repositioning of the Martinez refinery compared to impairment expense of $1.20 billion recorded in 2019 primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition;
•decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $482 million mainly due to decreases in salaries and employee-related expenses, transaction-related expenses, credit card processing fees for brand customers and contract services expenses;
•restructuring expense of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction. See See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for additional information; and
•increased other taxes of $107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes of approximately $78 million and $69 million, respectively. Property taxes increased in the current period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the Oil Spill Tax in 2020, which was not in effect for all of 2019. These increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses.
Net interest and other financial costs increased $136 million largely due to increased MPC borrowings and foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income. We capitalized interest of $129 million in 2020 and $158 million in 2019. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for further details.
Provision for income taxes decreased $3.21 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of $16.85 billion. The effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected net operating
loss carryback provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Additionally, our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 for further details.
Noncontrolling interests decreased $769 million mainly due to MPLX’s net loss primarily resulting from impairment expense recognized during 2020.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net income attributable to MPC decreased $143 million primarily due to impairment expense of $1.20 billion and an increase in net interest and other financial costs, partially offset by a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and increased income from discontinued operations in 2019. See Segment Results for additional information.
Total revenues and other income increased $25.28 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to:
•increased sales and other operating revenues of $25.06 billion mainly due to an increase in our Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which increased 1,032 mbpd largely due to the Andeavor acquisition on October 1, 2018, partially offset by lower average refined product sales prices, which decreased $0.09 per gallon; and
•increased net gain on disposal of assets of $272 million mainly due to $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline LLC and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019.
Total costs and expenses increased $25.50 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to:
•increased cost of revenues of $22.18 billion primarily due to the inclusion of costs related to the Andeavor operations following the acquisition;
•increased impairment expense of $1.20 billion primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition;
•increased depreciation and amortization of $1.06 billion, primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the Andeavor acquisition;
•increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $916 million mainly due to the inclusion of costs related to Andeavor operations following the acquisition and reflecting MPC’s classification of those costs and expenses; and
•increased other taxes of $155 million primarily due to the inclusion of other taxes related to the acquired Andeavor operations.
Net interest and other financial costs increased $236 million mainly due to debt assumed in the acquisition of Andeavor and increased MPLX borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement losses of $44 million. We capitalized interest of $158 million in 2019 and $80 million in 2018. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for further details.
Provision for income taxes on continuing operations increased $20 million primarily due to non-deductible goodwill impairments partially offset by decreased income from continuing operations $464 million. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The effective tax rate of 21 percent in 2018 is consistent with the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, as permanent benefit differences related to income attributable to noncontrolling interest were offset by state and local tax expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 for further details.
Noncontrolling interests decreased $214 million mainly due lower MPLX net income primarily as a result of the $1.2 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2019.
Results of Discontinued Operations
The results of Speedway are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.
The following includes key financial and operating data for Speedway for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(a)The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, excluding transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees (where applicable), divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume.
(b)See “Non-GAAP Measures” section for reconciliation and further information regarding this non-GAAP measure.
(c)The price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise.
(d)Same store comparison includes only locations owned at least 13 months.
(e)Excludes cigarettes.
2020 Compared to 2019
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $399 million primarily due to higher fuel margins partially offset by lower fuel volumes. Changes in fuel sales volumes were primarily due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in restricted travel, social distancing and reduced business operations. In addition, fuel sales volumes decreased as a result of an agreement between Speedway and Pilot Travel Centers (“PTC”), effective October 1, 2019, in which PTC supplies, prices and sells diesel fuel at certain Speedway and PTC locations with both companies sharing in the diesel fuel margins.
Beginning August 2, 2020, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway’s property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use lease assets. As a result, Speedway depreciation and amortization was $244 million and $413 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Speedway fuel margin increased to 34.52 cents per gallon in 2020 compared with 24.34 cents per gallon in 2019.
2019 Compared to 2018
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $133 million primarily due to higher fuel and merchandise margins largely related to the addition of the Andeavor retail operations. These increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and depreciation primarily related to the locations acquired from Andeavor.
The Speedway fuel margin increased to 24.34 cents per gallon in 2019 compared with 21.22 cents per gallon in 2018.
Segment Results
Our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segment income (loss) from continuing operations was approximately $(1.48) billion, $6.45 billion and $5.41 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Refining & Marketing
Beginning with the third quarter of 2020, the direct dealer business is managed as part of the Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Refining & Marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented.
The following includes key financial and operating data for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our results include the results of Andeavor from the October 1, 2018 acquisition date forward.
(a)Includes intersegment sales to Midstream and sales destined for export.
(a)Includes direct dealer results due to our third quarter change in segment presentation.
(b)Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by net refinery throughput.
(c)See “Non-GAAP Measures” section for reconciliation and further information regarding this non-GAAP measure.
(d)Includes refining operating and major maintenance costs. Excludes planned turnaround and depreciation and amortization expense.
(e)Reflects a benefit of $93 million in 2019 for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018.
(f)Includes income from equity method investments, net gain on disposal of assets and other income.
The following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Andeavor businesses are only included in our results from October 1, 2018 forward. The benchmark crack spreads below do not reflect the market cost of RINs necessary to meet EPA renewable volume obligations for attributable products under the Renewable Fuel Standard.
(a)The blended crack spread for the fourth quarter of 2020 is weighted 40 percent of the USGC crack spread, 40 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 20 percent of the West Coast crack spread. The blended crack spreads for the first three quarters of 2020, all of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 are weighted 38 percent of the USGC crack spread, 38 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 24 percent of the West Coast crack spread. The blended crack spread for the first three quarters of 2018 reflects the average weighting of 60 percent of the USGC crack spread and 40 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread. These blends are based on MPC’s refining capacity by region in each period.
2020 Compared to 2019
Refining & Marketing segment revenues decreased $41.16 billion primarily due to lower refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, and decreased average refined product sales prices of $0.55 per gallon.
Refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 82 percent during 2020 and net refinery throughputs decreased 529 mbpd primarily due to reducing throughputs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $8.05 billion primarily driven by lower blended crack spreads.
Refining & Marketing margin, excluding LIFO liquidation charge, was $8.96 per barrel for 2020 compared to $14.77 per barrel for 2019. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net negative impact of $9.75 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to lower crack spreads. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2020, a LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of
approximately $800 million, including the LIFO liquidation charge, in 2020 compared to 2019 resulting in a capture rate of 102 percent in 2020 and 96 percent in 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.37 billion. This was a decrease of $1.06 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.02 due to lower refinery throughput, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, including operating at lower throughput at our refineries and idling portions of our refining capacity. Net refinery throughput was 529 mbpd lower in 2020
Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.08 billion and $5.13 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.46 billion and $3.22 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a per barrel basis, distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $0.85 primarily due to lower throughput partially offset by a decrease in costs.
Refining planned turnaround costs increased $92 million, or $0.23 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity and a decrease in throughput.
Depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by $0.38, primarily due to a decrease in throughput and increased costs.
We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $606 million in 2020 and $356 million in 2019 and are included in Refining & Marketing margin. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs, partially offset by a decrease in our RIN obligations.
2019 Compared to 2018
Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $24.6 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased 1,032 mbpd, largely due to the acquisition of Andeavor on October 1, 2018, partially offset by decreased average refined product sales prices of $.09 per gallon.
Refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent during 2019 and net refinery throughputs increased 838 mbpd primarily due to the refineries acquired from Andeavor.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $202 million primarily due to a full year of direct dealer sales and an increase in Refining & Marketing margin on a per barrel basis partially offset by higher operating, distribution and depreciation and amortization costs. The increases in costs and expenses were primarily due to increased sales and production volumes following the Andeavor acquisition.
Refining & Marketing margin was $14.77 per barrel for 2019 compared to $14.50 per barrel for 2018. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net positive impact of $4.46 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to an approximate $5.35 billion benefit from increased throughput volume, mainly attributed to the Andeavor acquisition, partially offset by narrower sour and sweet crude oil differentials. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances and direct dealer fuel margin. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of approximately $370 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulting in a capture rate of 96 percent in 2019 compared to 92 percent in 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $6.42 billion. This was an increase of $2.28 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.67. Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.13 billion and $3.52 billion, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.22 billion and $2.28 billion, for 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was an increase of $1.61 billion, or $0.28 per barrel. Excluding depreciation and amortization, refining operating costs and distribution costs increased primarily due to the inclusion of costs for the refining operations acquired from Andeavor. The per barrel increases, among other items, reflect the addition of Andeavor’s West Coast
refineries, which generally have higher operating costs than other regions in which we operate due to specific geographical location and regulatory factors.
Refining planned turnaround costs decreased $76 million, or $0.15 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity.
Depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by $0.13, primarily due to the fair value of assets acquired from Andeavor as of October 1, 2018. During 2019, we recorded a $0.01 per barrel adjustment to reduce depreciation and amortization, which reflects the cumulative effects related to a measurement period adjustment arising from the finalization of purchase accounting.
We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $356 million in 2019 and $316 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in our RIN obligations resulting from the acquisition of Andeavor, partially offset by lower weighted average RIN costs.

2020 Compared to 2019
Midstream segment revenue decreased $322 million primarily due to decreased demand for the products that we produce and transport due to the current macro-economic conditions in addition to lower natural gas prices.
In 2020, Midstream segment income from operations increased $114 million mainly due stable, fee-based earnings in the current business environment, contributions from organic growth projects and reduced operating expenses.
2019 Compared to 2018
Midstream segment revenue increased $2.10 billion primarily due to the inclusion of ANDX revenues subsequent to the Andeavor acquisition on October 1, 2018. On July 30, 2019, MPLX acquired ANDX. In addition, 2019 reflects twelve months of fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment following the February 1, 2018 dropdown to MPLX. MPLX revenues from refining logistics and fuels distribution services provided to MPC were $1.48 billion and $1.36 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In 2019, Midstream segment income from operations increased $842 million largely due to contributions from ANDX in addition to growth across MPLX’s businesses.
Corporate
(a)Corporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of MPC’s corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets, except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX, which are included in the Midstream segment. Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing segment.
2020 Compared to 2019
Corporate expenses decreased $33 million in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to decreased salaries and contract services expenses, partially offset by increased expenses due to an information systems integration project. 2020 and 2019 corporate expenses include expenses of $26 million and $28 million, respectively, which are no longer allocable to Speedway due to discontinued operations accounting.
2019 Compared to 2018
Corporate expenses increased $305 million in 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to the inclusion of costs and expenses related to Andeavor operations. 2019 and 2018 corporate expenses include expenses of $28 million and $26 million, respectively, which are no longer allocable to Speedway due to discontinued operations accounting.
Items not Allocated to Segments
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments using segment income from operations. Items identified in the table below are either believed to be non-recurring in nature or not believed to be allocable, controlled by the segment or are not tied to the operational performance of the segment.
(a)2020 and 2019 includes costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts. Both 2019 and 2018 include employee severance, retention and other costs related to the acquisition of Andeavor. Effective October 1, 2019, we have discontinued reporting Andeavor transaction-related costs as one year has passed since the acquisition and these costs are immaterial. Costs incurred in connection with the Speedway separation are included in discontinued operations.
2020 Compared to 2019
Unallocated items include impairment charges of $9.74 billion which includes $8.43 billion related to goodwill and long-lived assets and $1.32 billion related to equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 for additional information.
During 2020, we indefinitely idled our Gallup refinery, initiated actions to strategically reposition our Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and approved an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for additional information.
Other unallocated items in 2020 include a favorable litigation settlement of $84 million and gain on sale of assets of $66 million related to the sale of three asphalt terminals and certain other Refining & Marketing assets.
2019 Compared to 2018
Unallocated items in 2019 include $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline LLC and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 for additional information.
In 2019, other unallocated items also include transaction-related costs of $153 million and a litigation reserve adjustment of $22 million. The transaction-related costs recognized during the year include the recognition of an obligation for vacation benefits provided to former Andeavor employees in the first quarter as well as employee retention, severance and other costs and the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts.
Impairment charges of $1.24 billion in 2019 primarily relate to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are as follows:
Refining & Marketing Margin
Refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes other items reflected in the table below.
Reconciliation of Refining & Marketing income from operations to Refining & Marketing gross margin and Refining & Marketing margin
(a)The gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, of operations that support Refining & Marketing such as biodiesel and ethanol ventures, power facilities and processing of credit card transactions.
Speedway Fuel Margin
Speedway fuel margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees (where applicable).
Speedway Merchandise Margin
Speedway merchandise margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise.
Reconciliation of Speedway income from discontinued operations to Speedway gross margin and Speedway margin
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $415 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2019, excluding $140 million and $134 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents related to the discontinued operations of Speedway which are included in assets held for sale. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $7.02 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results and an unfavorable change in working capital of $43 million. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3.28 billion in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in operating results, excluding impairment expenses, and a favorable change in working capital of $978 million. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.
For 2020, changes in working capital were a net $314 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices and inventory and refined product volumes on working capital. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude payable prices. Current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude and refined product receivable prices and refined product volumes. Inventories decreased mainly due to decreases in refined product, crude and materials & supplies inventories.
For 2019, changes in working capital were a net $357 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices and volumes on working capital. Accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable price and volumes. Current receivables increased primarily due to
increases in crude and refined product receivable volumes and prices. Inventories increased primarily due to increases in refined product and materials & supplies inventories partially offset by a decrease in crude inventory.
For 2018, changes in working capital were a net $621 million use of cash, primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices on working capital. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices. Inventories decreased primarily due to a decrease in crude and refined product inventories. Current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude oil receivable prices. All of these effects exclude the working capital acquired in connection with the acquisition of Andeavor.
Cash flows used in investing activities decreased $3.00 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 and decreased $1.41 billion in 2019 compared to 2018.
•Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment was primarily due to spending in our Midstream and Refining & Marketing segments in 2020. See discussion of capital expenditures and investments under the “Capital Spending” section.
•Cash used for acquisitions of $3.82 billion in 2018 primarily includes cash paid to Andeavor stockholders of $3.5 billion in connection with the acquisition of Andeavor on October 1, 2018.
•Net investments were a use of cash of $348 million in 2020 compared to $966 million in 2019 and $393 million in 2018. Investments in 2020 are largely due to investments in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the Gray Oak Pipeline and the Whistler Pipeline. Investments in 2019 are largely due to investments in connection with the Gray Oak Pipeline, which began initial start-up in the fourth quarter, the Wink to Webster Pipeline, the Whistler Pipeline and other Midstream projects.
•Cash provided by disposal of assets totaled $150 million, $47 million and $22 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2020 is mainly due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of assets in our Retail segment.
The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years.
Financing activities were a use of cash of $135 million in 2020, a use of cash of $3.38 billion in 2019 and a source of cash of $222 million in 2018.
•Long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $1.65 billion source of cash in 2020 compared to a $1.18 billion source of cash in 2019 and a $5.36 billion source of cash in 2018. During 2020, MPC issued $2.5 billion of senior notes, redeemed $1.13 billion of senior notes, borrowed and repaid $4.23 billion under its revolving credit facility, borrowed and repaid $3.55 billion under its trade receivables facility and had net borrowings of $1.02 billion under its commercial paper program. MPLX issued $3.0 billion of senior notes, which were used to repay $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under its term loan, $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and to redeem $750 million of fixed rate senior notes, and had net borrowings of $175 million under its revolving credit facility. During 2019, MPLX issued $2 billion of floating rate notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay various outstanding MPLX borrowings and for general business purposes, and had net borrowings of $1 billion under its term loan agreement. In addition, MPLX repaid $500 million of senior notes. During 2018, MPLX issued $7.75 billion of senior notes, redeemed $750 million of senior notes, borrowed and repaid $4.1 billion under a term loan agreement, and borrowed and repaid $1.41 billion and $1.92 billion,
respectively, under the MPLX Credit Agreement. In addition, MPC redeemed $600 million of senior notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 for additional information on our long-term debt.
•Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $1.95 billion in 2019 and $3.29 billion in 2018. See the “Capital Requirements” section for further discussion of our stock repurchases.
•Cash used in dividend payments totaled $1.51 billion in 2020, $1.40 billion in 2019 and $954 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to an increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases in 2019. The increase in 2019 was primarily due a net increase in the number of shares outstanding due to the approximate 239.8 million shares issued in connection with the Andeavor acquisition and a $0.28 per share increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases. Dividends per share were $2.32 in 2020, $2.12 in 2019 and $1.84 in 2018.
•Distributions to noncontrolling interests increased $342 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to increases in MPLX units outstanding and MPLX’s distribution per common unit. Distributions to noncontrolling interests included ANDX’s distribution per common unit paid in the first and second quarter of 2019, prior to the merger of ANDX and MPLX, and the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the acquisition of Andeavor on October 1, 2018.
