Executive Summary
Financial Results
Total assets increased $387.4 million to $2.33 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.94 billion at December 31, 2019. Earning assets increased $388.8 million to $2.15 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.76 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase of $388.8 million in earning assets was primarily driven by the $235.2 million increase in interest-bearing deposits with other banks due to increased deposit growth. Deposits increased $717.3 million to $1.98 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.27 billion at December 31, 2019. The overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the Company was 0.85% in 2020 compared to 1.68% in 2019. This cost of interest-bearing liabilities, combined with the earning asset yield, resulted in a net interest margin (tax-equivalent) of 3.57% in 2020 compared to 3.53% in 2019.
Net interest income increased $9.4 million, noninterest income increased $27.2 million and noninterest expenses increased by $9.9 million during 2020 compared to 2019. The Company’s yield on earning assets (tax-equivalent) in 2020 was 4.17% compared to 4.87% in 2019. Total loans increased by $79.2 million to $1.45 billion at December 31, 2020.
The Company earned $37.4 million in 2020 compared to $27.0 million in 2019, an increase of $10.4 million. The 2020 earnings equated to a return on average assets of 1.7% and a return on average equity of 16.7%, compared to 2019 results of 1.4% and 13.6%, respectively. Basic earnings per share were $3.13 in 2020 compared to $2.26 in 2019. Diluted earnings per share were $3.06 in 2020 compared to $2.20 in 2019.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a great degree of uncertainty to both the global and domestic economy, as well as financial markets. The full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and continues to evolve. Financial markets adjusted dramatically to the reduced economic activity and the pace of recovery is uncertain. The financial market benchmark most relevant to the Company’s current and future profitability is the United States Government Treasury yield curve. The United States Government Treasury yield curve is used as a basis for the pricing of most bonds, loans, borrowings, deposits and other fixed income yield curves. The United States Government Treasury yield curve has experienced a large, relatively parallel, downward shift. Given the Company’s asset-sensitive position, management expects that net interest income will decline. As the outlook for the COVID-19 pandemic improves, management expects that the United States Government Treasury curve will experience some degree of an upward shift over time.
Management expects that some clients will be unable to meet their financial obligations in the near-term as a result of the decreased economic activity brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, management does not expect that these credit concerns will perpetuate indefinitely. Many clients may be eligible to defer loan payments to a later date. The Company actively participated in the PPP, is evaluating other programs available to assist its clients and is providing consumer deferrals consistent with government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) guidelines. Management is working to incorporate scenarios that reflect decreased loan cash flows in the short term into the Company’s interest rate risk models.
There was considerable demand for the PPP implemented by the CARES Act to combat the economic slowdown brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP was created to provide funding to small business owners who may have had to temporarily close or scale back production as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intended use of this funding is to pay employees who may be temporarily unable to work. The original tranche of PPP funding of $349 billion ran out 13 days after the program's implementation. The second tranche of PPP funding of $310 billion had funds available as of the program's closure date. On July 2, 2020, additional legislation was passed that allowed small businesses to apply for loans through August 8, 2020. On January 8, 2021, the SBA announced that the PPP program would reopen on January 11, 2021 for new borrowers and certain existing PPP
borrowers. During the latest round, funds totaling $284 billion were authorized through March 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2020, commercial loans totaling $34.7 million and mortgage loans totaling $13.5 million were approved for modifications, such as interest-only payments and payment deferrals. These modifications were not considered to be troubled debt restructurings in reliance on guidance issued by banking regulators titled the “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.” The Company originated 455 PPP loans with original balances of $92.8 million and outstanding balances of $82.0 million as of December 31, 2020 are included on the Company's balance sheet.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin (Average Balance Schedules)
The following tables present, for the periods indicated, information about (1) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest earning assets and the resultant average yields; (2) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (3) the interest rate spread; (4) net interest income and margin; and (5) net interest income and margin (on a tax-equivalent basis). The average balances presented are derived from daily average balances.
Average Balances and Analysis of Net Interest Income
1 Non-accrual loans are included in total loan balances, lowering the effective yield for the portfolio in the aggregate.
2 In order to make pre-tax income and resultant yields on tax-exempt loans and investment securities comparable to those on taxable loans and investment securities, a tax-equivalent adjustment has been computed using a Federal tax rate of 21% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure following this table.
3 The Company’s PPP loans, totaling $82.0 million at December 31, 2020, are included in this amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Rate Volume Calculation
The year over year change in rate volume to 2020 from 2019 is as follows:
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and certificates of deposit in banks. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds such as sweep accounts and repurchase agreements. Net interest income, which is the primary source of revenue for the Bank, is also impacted by changes in market interest rates, as well as the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is impacted favorably by increases in noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity.
Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets and serves as a measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the Bank’s balance sheet. Net interest margin (tax equivalent) was 3.57% in 2020 compared to 3.53% in 2019. The net interest margin continues to face considerable pressure due to falling interest rates and competitive pricing of loans and deposits in the Bank’s markets. During 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate from a range of 1.50% to 1.75% to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. Management’s estimate of the impact of future changes in market interest rates is shown in the section captioned Interest Rate Risk, in
