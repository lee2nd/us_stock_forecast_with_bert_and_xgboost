Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
OVERVIEW
Exponent is an engineering and scientific consulting firm providing solutions to complex problems. Exponent's interdisciplinary organization of scientists, physicians, engineers, and business consultants draws from more than 90 technical disciplines to solve the most pressing and complicated challenges facing stakeholders today. The firm leverages over 50 years of experience in analyzing accidents and failures to advise clients as they innovate their technologically complex products and processes, ensure the safety and health of their users, and address the challenges of sustainability.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts have a potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the assumptions, judgments and estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see “Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue recognition. We derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements, fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities, as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients.
Substantially all of our engagements are service contracts performed under time and material or fixed-price billing arrangements. For time and material and fixed-price service projects, revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed. For substantially all of our fixed-price service engagements, we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract. Our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects. We believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed-price contracts.
Management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period. These judgments and estimates include an assessment of the estimate as to the total effort required to complete fixed-price projects.
Estimating the allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts. We make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled but recognized work-in-process. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us or for disputes with customers that affect our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable and unbilled work-in-process, we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers we recognize allowances for contract losses and doubtful accounts taking into consideration factors such as historical write-offs, customer concentration, customer creditworthiness, current economic conditions, and aging of amounts due.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and the percentage increase (decrease) in the dollar amount of such items year to year:
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Revenues for 2020 decreased 4% and revenues before reimbursements decreased 3% as compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenues before reimbursements was due to a decrease in billable hours partially offset by an increase in billing rates. Business restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic caused project delays across multiple areas of our business. Our litigation support work slowed with many projects paused due to court-related delays and closures. The business restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic also delayed our human participant studies. The decrease in revenues before reimbursements was also due to fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity as compared to fiscal 2019. We continued to see strength in integrity management advisory services for the utilities sector as our clients focused on power reliability, in particular due to fire safety concerns in the western United States. We also experienced growth in our chemical regulation and food safety practice as our scientists evaluated the effects of chemicals and new products on human health and the environment.
Society is raising the bar for safety, health, sustainability and reliability, and clients are increasingly seeking our interdisciplinary proactive solutions. We have been engaged by industry and government to help in the response to the coronavirus. We continue to advise clients with respect to disinfectant products and procedures, COVID-19 testing, contract tracing, and occupational health and safety. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we deployed wearable technology platforms for COVID-19 risk monitoring and mitigation for the U.S. Army and Navy.
Net income was $82,552,000 during 2020 as compared to $82,460,000 during 2019. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.55 for 2020 as compared to $1.53 for 2019. Net income and diluted earnings per share for 2020 benefited from a decrease in our effective tax rate due to an increase in the excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards. The excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards increased to $12,258,000 during 2020 as compared to $8,067,000 during 2019.
We remain focused on selectively adding top talent and developing the skills necessary to expand upon our market position, providing clients with in-depth scientific research and analysis to determine what happened and how to prevent failures or exposures in the future. We also remain focused on capitalizing on emerging growth areas, managing other operating expenses, generating cash from operations, maintaining a strong balance sheet and undertaking activities such as share repurchases and dividends to enhance shareholder value.
COVID-19 Update
We responded quickly and carefully to address the unprecedented challenges created by the pandemic. We have successfully adapted and will continue to evolve our business development, recruiting and operational approaches, yielding benefits both during and after this crisis. We have accelerated our sharing of in-depth scientific and regulatory knowledge through webinars and thought leadership pieces, which has fostered new client relationships and projects. We have shifted all recruiting activities online, allowing us to reach a more geographically expansive set of candidates. The health and safety of our team remain top priorities, and therefore we have leveraged our internal expertise to establish protocols that allow us to safely continue laboratory activities and resume human participant studies. Our business continuity plan and robust infrastructure have empowered productive remote work, and employees continue to work from home unless they are performing laboratory testing or inspections. Our leadership team has responded with enhanced internal communications to encourage increased connectivity across the firm.
We are pleased that the Company has been able to address the majority of our clients’ needs with a mostly remote workforce. The relaxation of business restrictions in June allowed us to resume laboratory testing, inspections, and human participant studies for clients in non-essential industries. Field inspections of sites and products have increased due to lifting of travel restrictions but are still occurring at a reduced level since many businesses are not fully operational.
We continue to receive new retentions for litigation support, and work is ongoing for many existing matters. At the same time, trial dates continue to be delayed, removing imminent deadlines and causing some clients - in particular the automotive industry - to pause work. Courts have been experimenting with virtual bench trials as well as social distancing for in-person trials, so we expect trials will gradually increase.
We are pleased to be sharing our scientific and regulatory knowledge on health and safety issues related to the novel coronavirus through webinars and thought leadership pieces. We continue to advise clients with respect to disinfectant products and procedures, COVID-19 testing, contract tracing, and occupational health and safety.
OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 1, 2021
Our revenues consist of professional fees earned on consulting engagements, fees for use of our equipment and facilities, and reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services performed that are billed to our clients.
We operate on a 52-53 week fiscal year with each year ending on the Friday closest to December 31st. The fiscal year ended January 1, 2021 included 52 weeks of activity. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2020 included 53 weeks of activity. The fiscal year ended December 28, 2018 included 52 weeks of activity.

During 2020, billable hours decreased 7% to 1,273,000 as compared to 1,376,000 during 2019. Our utilization decreased to 67% for 2020 as compared to 72% for 2019. Technical full-time equivalent employees increased 1% to 912 for 2020 as compared to 901 for 2019. We continue to selectively hire key talent to expand our capabilities.
FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 1, 2021, AND JANUARY 3, 2020
Revenues
The decrease in revenues for our Engineering and Other Scientific segment was due to a decrease in billable hours partially offset by an increase in billing rates. During 2020, billable hours for this segment decreased by 10% to 976,000 as compared to 1,084,000 during 2019. Utilization for this segment decreased to 67% for 2020 as compared to 73% for 2019. Business restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic caused project delays across multiple practices within this segment. The most substantial impact was on our litigation support work with many projects paused due to court-related delays. The business restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic also delayed our human participant studies. The decrease in billable hours was also due to fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. We continued to see strength in integrity management advisory services for the utilities sector as our clients focus on power reliability, in particular due to fire safety concerns in the western United States. Technical full-time equivalent employees in this segment increased 1% to 704 during 2020 as compared to 699 for 2019.
Clients continued to seek out our expertise for proactive and reactive engagements across a broad range of industries and use cases. Our multidisciplinary battery team leveraged its experience in consumer electronics to advance energy storage for electric vehicles and medical devices. Our integrity management advisory services for the utilities industry remained strong as clients and regulators focused on power reliability and safety. Our biomedical team advised clients as they navigated evolving regulatory frameworks around the world.
The increase in revenues from our Environmental and Health segment was due to an increase in billable hours and an increase in billing rates partially offset by fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. During 2020, billable hours for this segment increased by 2% to 297,000 as compared to 292,000 during 2019. The increase in billable hours was due to growth in our chemical regulation & food safety practice where we expanded our proactive services. The increase in billable hours was partially offset by fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. This segment also experienced delays in litigation related projects due to business restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization for this segment increased to 69% during 2020 as compared to 68% during 2019. Technical full-time equivalents increased 3% to 208 during 2020 as compared to 202 for 2019 due to our recruiting and retention efforts.
Revenues are primarily derived from services provided in response to client requests or events that occur without notice and engagements are generally terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by our clients. As a result, backlog at any particular time is small in relation to our quarterly or annual revenues and is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods.
Compensation and Related Expenses
The decrease in compensation and related expenses during 2020 was due to a change in the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in bonus expense, partially offset by an increase in payroll expense. During 2020, deferred compensation expense decreased $4,806,000 with a corresponding decrease to other income, net, as compared to the prior year due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This decrease consisted of an increase in the value of the plan assets of $8,028,000 during 2020 as compared to an increase in the value of the plan assets of $12,834,000 during 2019. During 2020, bonus expense decreased by $3,710,000 due to a corresponding decrease in the bonus pool, which is 33% of income before income taxes, interest income, bonus expense, and stock-based compensation. Payroll expense increased $6,187,000 during 2020 due to the increase in technical full-time equivalent employees and the impact of our annual salary increase, partially offset by fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. We expect our compensation expense, excluding the change in value of deferred compensation plan assets, to increase as we selectively add new talent and adjust compensation to market conditions.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses include facilities-related costs, technical materials, computer-related expenses and depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in occupancy expense of $978,000 and a decrease in technical materials of $487,000. The decrease in occupancy expenses and technical materials were primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic-related business restrictions and fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. We expect other operating expense to grow as we selectively add new talent and make additional investments in our corporate infrastructure.
Reimbursable Expenses
The amount of reimbursable expenses will vary from year to year depending on the nature of our projects. The decrease during 2020 was primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic-related business and travel restrictions.
General and Administrative Expenses
The decrease in general and administrative expenses during 2020 was primarily due to decreases in travel and meals of $5,969,000 and a decrease in personnel expenses of $1,348,000. The decrease was also due to fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. The decrease in travel and meals and personnel expenses were primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic-related business and travel restrictions. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we selectively add new talent, expand our business development efforts, and pursue staff development initiatives.
Operating Income
The decrease in operating income for our Engineering and Other Scientific segment during 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to a decrease in revenues. The decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in billable hours, partially offset by an increase in billing rates. Business restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic caused project delays across multiple practices within this segment. The most substantial impact was on our litigation support work with many projects paused due to court-related delays. The business restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic also delayed our human participant studies. The decrease in billable hours was also due to fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. We continued to see strength in the integrity management advisory services for the utilities sector. The impact of the decrease in revenues to operating income for this segment was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses primarily due to the business and travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The slight increase in operating income for our Environmental and Health segment during 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to an increase in revenues. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in billable hours and an increase in billing rates, partially offset by fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019. The increase in billable hours was due to growth in our chemical regulation & food safety practice where we expanded our proactive services.
Certain operating expenses are excluded from the Company’s measure of segment operating income. These expenses include the costs associated with our human resources, finance, information technology, and business development groups; the deferred compensation expense/benefit due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan; stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock unit and stock option awards; and the change in our allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts.
The decrease in corporate operating expenses during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation expense. During 2020, deferred compensation expense decreased $4,806,000, with a corresponding decrease to other income, net, as compared to the prior year, due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This decrease consisted of an increase in the value of plan assets of $8,028,000 during 2020 as compared to an increase in the value of plan assets of $12,834,000 during 2019. The decrease in corporate operating expenses was also due to a decrease in travel and meals and personnel expenses primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic-related business and travel restrictions. The decrease was also due to fiscal 2020 having one less week of activity than fiscal 2019.
Other Income
Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, changes in the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan and rental income from leasing excess space in our Silicon Valley facility. The decrease in other income was primarily due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in interest income of $2,207,000, partially offset by an increase in the realized gain on foreign exchange of $1,432,000 and an increase in rental income of $210,000. During 2020, other income decreased $4,806,000 with a corresponding decrease to deferred compensation expense as compared to 2019, due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This change consisted of an increase in the value of the plan assets of $8,028,000 during 2020 as compared to an increase in the value of the plan assets of $12,834,000 during 2019. The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates for our cash equivalents and short-term investments. The increase in the realized gain on foreign exchange was due to an increase in the value of monetary assets denominated in non-functional currencies during 2020 and the recognition of a foreign currency exchange loss of $601,000 during 2019 associated with the divestiture of our German subsidiary.
Income Taxes
The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to an increase in the excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards and a 2019 tax charge associated with the divestiture of our German subsidiary. The excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards increased to $12,258,000 during 2020 as compared to $8,067,000 during 2019. During 2019 we recognized a tax charge of $956,000 associated with the divestiture of our German subsidiary.
FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 3, 2020, AND DECEMBER 28, 2018
Revenues
The increase in revenues for our Engineering and Other Scientific segment was due to an increase in billable hours and an increase in billing rates. During 2019, billable hours for this segment increased by 9.3% to 1,084,000 as compared to 992,000 during 2018. This segment had strong growth in its biomedical engineering, buildings & structures, construction consulting, human factors, materials & corrosion engineering, thermal sciences, and polymer science & materials chemistry practices. We continued to see strong demand from multinational companies for our scientific expertise and advice regarding their products. Safety concerns regarding energy storage systems drove increased demand for risk assessments in the consumer products, transportation, utility and medical device industries. The increase in billable hours was also due to fiscal 2019 having one additional week of activity than fiscal 2018. Utilization decreased to 73% for 2019 as compared to 75% for 2018. The decrease in utilization was due to the completion of a large human factors’ assessment in the third quarter of 2018. Technical full-time equivalents increased 9.2% to 699 for 2019 as compared to 640 for 2018 due to our recruiting and retention efforts.
The increase in revenues from our Environmental and Health segment was due to an increase in billable hours and an increase in billing rates. During 2019, billable hours for this segment increased by 3.5% to 292,000 as compared to 282,000 during 2018. The increase in billable hours was due to growth in our chemical regulation and food safety practice where we expanded our proactive services. The increase in billable hours was also due to fiscal 2019 having one additional week of activity than fiscal 2018. Utilization was 68% for both 2019 and 2018. Technical full-time equivalents increased 1.5% to 202 during 2019 as compared to 199 for 2018 due to our recruiting and retention efforts.
Revenues are primarily derived from services provided in response to client requests or events that occur without notice and engagements are generally terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by our clients. As a result, backlog at any particular time is small in relation to our quarterly or annual revenues and is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods.
Compensation and Related Expenses
The increase in compensation and related expenses during 2019 was due to an increase in payroll expense, an increase in bonus expense, an increase in fringe benefits, and a change in the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. During 2019, payroll and fringe benefits increased $13,629,000 and $1,735,000, respectively, due to the increase in technical full-time equivalent employees, the impact of our annual salary increase, and fiscal 2019 having one additional week of activity than fiscal 2018. During 2019, bonus expense increased by $4,576,000 due to a corresponding increase in income before income taxes, before bonus expense, and before stock-based compensation. During 2019, deferred compensation expense increased $16,734,000 with a corresponding increase to other income, net, as compared with the prior year due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This increase consisted of an increase in the value of the plan assets of $12,834,000 during 2019 as compared to a decrease in the value of the plan assets of $3,900,000 during 2018.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses include facilities-related costs, technical materials, computer-related expenses and depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in occupancy expense of $1,028,000, an increase in information technology expenses of $768,000, an increase in depreciation and amortization of $514,000, and an increase in technical materials of $317,000. These increases were due to our increase in technical full-time equivalent employees, investments in our corporate infrastructure and fiscal 2019 having one additional week of activity than fiscal 2018.
Reimbursable Expenses
The amount of reimbursable expenses will vary from year to year depending on the nature of our projects.
General and Administrative Expenses
The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2019 was primarily due to an increase in travel and meals of $1,724,000, an increase in marketing and promotion of $334,000, an increase in bad debt of $259,000 and several other individually insignificant increases. The increase in travel and meals was due to a firm-wide managers meeting held during 2019, an increase in technical full-time equivalent employees, an increase in business development and professional development activities and fiscal 2019 having one additional week of activity than fiscal 2018. The increase in marketing and promotion was due to an increase in business development activities.
Operating Income
The increase in operating income for our Engineering and Other Scientific segment during 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in revenues. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in billable hours and an increase in billing rates. We continued to see strong demand for our services related to product recalls, including assignments from the consumer products and automotive industries. Proactive services continued to expand as companies sought our interdisciplinary advice throughout the product life cycle, consistent with the increased importance placed on understanding how users interact with complex technologies.
The increase in operating income for our Environmental and Health segment during 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in revenues. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in billable hours and an increase in billing rates. The increase in billable hours was due to the expansion of our chemical regulation & food safety proactive services.
Certain operating expenses are excluded from the Company's measure of segment operating income. These expenses include the costs associated with our human resources, finance, information technology, and business development groups; the deferred compensation expense/benefit due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan; stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock unit and stock option awards; and the change in our allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts.
The increase in corporate operating expenses during 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in deferred compensation expense. During 2019, deferred compensation expense increased $16,734,000, with a corresponding increase to other income, net, as compared to the prior year, due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This increase consisted of an increase in the value of plan assets of $12,834,000 during 2019 as compared to a decrease in the value of plan assets of $3,900,000 during 2018. The increase in corporate operating expenses was also due to an increase in travel and meals due to a firm-wide managers meeting held during 2019, an increase in stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock unit grants, and increases in expenses for our human resources, finance, information technology, and business development groups due to increases in technical full-time equivalent employees, investments in our corporate infrastructure and fiscal 2019 having one additional week of activity than fiscal 2018.
Other Income
Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, changes in the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan and rental income from leasing excess space in our Silicon Valley facility. The increase in other income was primarily due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in loss on foreign exchange. During 2019, other income increased $16,734,000 with a corresponding increase to deferred compensation expense as compared to 2018. This change consisted of an increase in the value of the plan assets of $12,834,000 during 2019 as compared to a decrease in the value of the plan assets of $3,900,000 during 2018. The increase in interest income of $1,161,000 was due to higher average balances and higher interest rates for our cash equivalents and short-term investments. During 2019, we recognized a foreign currency exchange loss of $601,000 associated with the planned divestiture of our German subsidiary.
Income Taxes
The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to an increase in the excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards partially offset by a tax charge associated with the planned divestiture of our German subsidiary. The excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards increased to $8,067,000 during 2019 as compared to $4,154,000 during 2018. During 2019, we recognized a tax charge of $956,000 associated with the planned divestiture of our German subsidiary.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We financed our business in 2020 through available cash and cash flows from operating activities. We invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of January 1, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $242,526,000 as compared to $231,601,000 at January 3, 2020. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, stock repurchases, dividends and other liquidity requirements over at least the next 12 months.
Generally, our net cash provided by operating activities is used to fund our day-to-day operating activities. First quarter operating cash requirements are generally higher due to payment of our annual bonuses accrued during the prior year. Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our clients. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, leased facilities, taxes, and general operating expenses.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $103.3 million for 2020 as compared to $108.1 million and $91.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by/used in investing activities was primarily related to the purchase and maturity of short-term investments and capital expenditures. During 2019 we substantially completed construction of our office and laboratory facilities in Natick, Massachusetts. Total capital expenditures associated with this facility were $15.2 million during 2019. During 2018, we purchased 2.9 acres of land in Natick, Massachusetts, and started construction of our office and laboratory facilities. The total purchase price for the land was $5.2 million and our total capital expenditures during 2018 associated with the construction were $5.3 million.
The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to an increase in our quarterly dividend payment and an increase in repurchases of our common stock. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in our quarterly dividend payment partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of our common stock.
We expect to continue our investing activities, including capital expenditures. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs, pay dividends, procure facilities and equipment or strategically acquire professional service firms that are complementary to our business.
The following schedule summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of January 1, 2021 (in thousands):
The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1,873,000, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to “Note 7: Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits.
We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of a select group of highly compensated employees. Vested amounts due under the plans of $83,961,000 were recorded as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2021. Vested amounts due under the plans of $5,016,000 were recorded as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2021. Company assets that are earmarked to pay benefits under the plans are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to the claims of our creditors. As of January 1, 2021, invested amounts under the plans of $83,731,000 were recorded as a long-term asset on our consolidated balance sheet. As of January 1, 2021, invested amounts under the plans of $5,016,000 were recorded as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, conditions for use of Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) financial measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain Non-GAAP financial information. Generally, a Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We closely monitor two financial measures, EBITDA and EBITDAS, which meet the definition of Non-GAAP financial measures. We define EBITDA as net income before income taxes, interest income, depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAS as EBITDA before stock-based compensation. We regard EBITDA and EBITDAS as useful measures of operating performance and cash flow to complement operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and EBITDAS provide meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. These measures are used to evaluate our financial results, develop budgets and determine employee compensation. These measures, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure is set forth below.
The following table shows EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The decrease in EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to a 3% decrease in revenues before reimbursements, partially offset by a 37% decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily due to the business and travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The slight increase in EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to 10% growth in revenues before reimbursements, partially offset by a 17% increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to a firm-wide managers’ meeting during 2020.
The following table is a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDAS to the most comparable GAAP measure, net income, for 2020, 2019 and 2018:
