Ltd., Spitfire Controls (Cayman) Co. Ltd., wholly-owned foreign enterprises Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. (collectively, “SigmaTron China”) and international procurement office SigmaTron Taiwan branch (collectively, the “Company”) and other Items in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements concerning the Company’s business or results of operations. Words such as “continue,” “anticipate,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “plan,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the Company. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company’s plans, actions and actual results could differ materially. Such statements should be evaluated in the context of the direct and indirect risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company’s business including, but not necessarily limited to, the risks inherent in any merger, acquisition or business combination; the Company’s continued dependence on certain significant customers; the continued market acceptance of products and services offered by the Company and its customers; pricing pressures from the Company’s customers, suppliers and the market; the activities of competitors, some of which may have greater financial or other resources than the Company; the variability of the Company’s operating results; the results of long-lived assets impairment testing; the ability to achieve the expected benefits of acquisitions as well as the expenses of acquisitions; the collection of aged account receivables; the variability of the Company’s customers’ requirements; the impact of inflation on the Company’s operating results; the availability and cost of necessary components and materials; the ability of the Company and its customers to keep current with technological changes within its industries; regulatory compliance, including conflict minerals; the continued availability and sufficiency of the Company’s credit arrangements, including the phase-out of LIBOR; the ability to meet the Company’s financial and restrictive covenants under its loan agreements; changes in U.S., Mexican, Chinese, Vietnamese or Taiwanese regulations affecting the Company’s business; the turmoil in the global economy and financial markets; the spread of COVID-19 and variants (commonly known as “COVID-19”) which has threatened the Company’s financial stability by causing a decrease in consumer revenues, caused a disruption to the Company’s global supply chain, caused plant closings or reduced operations thus reducing output at those facilities; the stability of the U.S., Mexican, Chinese, Vietnamese and Taiwanese economic, labor and political systems and conditions; currency exchange fluctuations; and the ability of the Company to manage its growth. These and other factors which may affect the Company’s future business and results of operations are identified throughout the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as risk factors, may be detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Overview
The Company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of EMS, which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled (box-build) electronic products. In connection with the production of assembled products, the Company also provides services to its customers, including (1) automatic
and manual assembly and testing of products; (2) material sourcing and procurement; (3) manufacturing and test engineering support; (4) design services; (5) warehousing and distribution services; and (6) assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies. The Company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the United States, Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan.
The Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company’s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer’s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers. The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers. The Company believes that short-term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility, given that the Company’s orders are based on the changing needs of its customers.
Sales can be a misleading indicator of the Company’s financial performance. Sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services (turnkey versus consignment) rendered by the Company and the demand by customers. Consignment orders require the Company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer, and the Company charges only for its labor, overhead and manufacturing costs, plus a profit. In the case of turnkey orders, the Company provides, in addition to manufacturing services, the components and other materials used in assembly. Turnkey contracts, in general, have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly, owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold. Variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the Company’s revenue and gross margin levels. Consignment orders accounted for less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for each of the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020.
The Company’s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the Company to manufacture in China, Mexico, Vietnam or the U.S. We believe this strategy will continue to serve the Company well as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies.
Factors Affecting Results
COVID-19. The Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, especially beginning in mid-March, and such impact continued through fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and both public and private measures taken to contain it have negatively affected the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, all of which may continue or worsen.
PPP Loan and CARES Act. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 the Company received a $6,282,973 PPP Loan. The Company received the PPP Loan under the CARES Act. The Company believes it met the requirements for eligibility. To the extent that part or all of the loan is forgiven under the program, that benefit will be recorded in the quarter in which the forgiveness occurs. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 and continuing in fiscal year 2021, the Company had operational interruptions and incurred significant expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic at all of its operations. In some locations the interruptions and expenses were worse than others.
For more information on the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have adversely affected the Company’s results of operations and its financial condition, and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.” The Company was notified of the forgiveness of the PPP Loan by the SBA on July 9, 2021 and it covers all principal and accrued interest. The accounting for the forgiveness will be reflected in the Company’s first quarter financial statements for fiscal year 2022.
Recent Developments
On May 29, 2020, SigmaTron and Wagz, Inc. (“Wagz”), a privately held company in the pet technology market, entered into a Convertible Secured Promissory Note in the principal sum of up to $4,052,478. On January 27, 2021, Wagz issued an additional Convertible Secured Promissory Note to the Company in the principal sum of up to $1,588,328. On April 30, 2021, Wagz issued an additional Convertible Secured Promissory Note to the Company in the principal amount of $1,249,966. On April 30, 2021, Wagz issued a Secured Promissory Note to the Company in the principal amount of $308,329 (collectively, the “Notes”). At April 30, 2021, $7,014,594 and $184,207 was outstanding under Note receivable and Other receivables, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. The Notes are due (the “Maturity Date”) on the earliest to occur of (a) December 31, 2021 or, if the closing of the Company’s proposed acquisition of Wagz (the “Closing”) does not occur due to the Company’s termination, that date which is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, (b) upon the closing of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets or common stock of Wagz (other than the Closing), or (c) an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes). Interest is payable at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum and is payable on the Maturity Date. The Notes are collateralized by substantially all assets of Wagz.
On June 4, 2020, SigmaTron and Wagz, announced that they executed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) relating to a proposed acquisition. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the LOI, SigmaTron expects to issue approximately 2,443,870 shares of SigmaTron common stock that would result in the stockholders of Wagz owning in the aggregate approximately one-third of the combined company. The potential benefits to the Company from that transaction were summarized in the June 4, 2020 announcement. On July 19, 2021 the definitive agreement was signed. The parties expect the transaction to close by September 30, 2021 and it remains subject to achievement of certain milestones and satisfaction of conditions by both parties prior to closing including the Company having determined that the Wagz Freedom Smart Collar™ meets certain criteria, and the approval by the stockholders of both SigmaTron and Wagz.
Critical Accounting Policies:
Management Estimates and Uncertainties - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods, the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for inventory, deferred income, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions, valuation allowance for deferred taxes and valuation of long-lived assets. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
The potential impact of future disruptions and continued economic uncertainty over COVID-19 may have a significant adverse impact on the timing of delivery of customer orders and the levels of future customer orders. It is reasonably possible that these potential adverse impacts may result in the recognition of material impairments of the Company’s long-lived assets or other related charges in future periods.
Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s primary performance obligation to its customers is the production of finished goods electronic assembly products pursuant to purchase orders. The Company has concluded that control of the products it sells and transfers to its customers and an enforceable right to receive payment is customarily established at the point in time when the finished goods are shipped to its customers, or in some cases delivered pursuant to the specified shipping terms of each customer arrangement. With respect to consignment arrangements, control transfers and revenue is recognized at the point in time when the goods are shipped to the customer from the consignment location or when delivered to the customer (pursuant to agreed upon shipping terms). In those limited instances where finished goods delivered to the customer location are stored in a segregated area which are not controlled by the customer (title transfer, etc.) until they are pulled from the segregated area and consumed by the Company’s customer, revenue is recognized upon consumption. For tooling services, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied at the
point in time when the customer takes possession of dies or molds. For engineering, design, and testing services, the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as the respective services are rendered as its customers simultaneously derive value from the Company’s performance. From the time that a customer purchase order is received and contract is established, the Company’s performance obligations are typically fulfilled within a few weeks. The Company does not have any performance obligations that require more than one year to fulfill.
Each customer purchase order sets forth the transaction price for the products and services purchased under that arrangement. The Company evaluates the credit worthiness of its customers and exercises judgment to recognize revenue based upon the amount the Company expects to be paid for each sales transaction it enters into with its customers. Some customer arrangements include variable consideration, such as volume rebates, some of which depend upon the Company’s customers meeting specified performance criteria, such as a purchasing level over a period of time. The Company exercises judgment to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration at each reporting date.
Inventories - Inventories are valued at cost. Cost is determined by an average cost method and the Company allocates labor and overhead to work-in-process and finished goods. In the event of an inventory write-down, the Company records expense to state the inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company establishes inventory reserves for valuation, shrinkage, and excess and obsolete inventory. The Company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Of the Company’s raw materials inventory, a substantial portion has been purchased to fulfill committed future orders or for which the Company is contractually entitled to recover its costs from its customers. For the remaining raw materials inventory, a provision for excess and obsolete inventories is recorded for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions. Upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory, the corresponding reserve is relieved to ensure the cost basis of the inventory reflects any reductions. Actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the Company’s inventories and cost of products sold as the inventory is sold or otherwise relieved.
Intangible Assets - Intangible assets are comprised of finite life intangible assets including customer relationships. Finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of 7 years except for customer relationships which are amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful life of 15 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - The Company reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment. Property, machinery and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. If events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment, the Company first performs an impairment review based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of its assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment, if any, for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset group and its carrying value. The Company further conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment. The Company’s analysis for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 did not indicate that any of its other long-lived assets were impaired.
Income Tax - The Company’s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates by management are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense assessment.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In evaluating the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considers all available positive
and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company begins with historical results and changes in accounting policies, and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment and estimates by management about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, the Company considers three years of cumulative operating income and/or loss. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount more likely than not to be realized. The Company’s valuation allowance was $1,138,736 and $989,194 as of April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020, respectively. The increase in valuation allowance is attributable to an increase in underlying NOL carryforwards in China and Vietnam.
The calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across its global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Except as noted below, management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may only be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
The Company adjusts its tax liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from its current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.

Results of Operations:
FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2021 COMPARED
TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2020
The following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to net sales for the years indicated:

Net sales decreased 1.2% to $277,718,672 in fiscal year 2021 from $281,042,482 in the prior year. The Company’s sales decreased in fiscal year 2021 in industrial electronics and medical/life science compared to the
prior year. The decrease in sales dollars for these marketplaces was partially offset by an increase in sales dollars in the consumer electronics marketplace. The overall decrease in net sales was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 during the first quarter in fiscal year 2021.
Gross profit decreased to $24,952,197, or 9.0% of net sales, in fiscal year 2021 compared to $25,104,890 or 8.9% of net sales, in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit dollars for fiscal year 2021 was primarily the result of decreased sales.
Selling and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year 2021 to $21,562,413, or 7.8% of net sales compared to $22,292,309, or 7.9% of net sales, in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in selling and administrative dollars was attributable to sales salaries, bad debt recoveries, travel expense and financing fees. The decrease in the foregoing selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by an increase in legal fees, bonus expense and other general and administrative expenses. Selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of net sales due to a decrease in total selling and administrative dollars in fiscal year 2021 compared to the prior year.
Interest expense, net, decreased to $1,210,024 in fiscal year 2021 compared to $1,839,060 in fiscal year 2020. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the decreased borrowings and interest rates under the Company’s banking arrangements and mortgage obligations.
In fiscal year 2021, the Company reported income tax expense of $557,741 compared to an income tax expense of $650,032 in fiscal year 2020. The effective rate for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020 was 26.58% and 59.47%, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense and effective tax rate is due primarily to overall foreign currency gains recognized in the foreign jurisdictions in the prior year.
The Company reported net income of $1,541,019 in fiscal year 2021 compared to net income of $443,102 for fiscal year 2020. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2021 were $0.36 each compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.10 each for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources:
Operating Activities.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $8,098,946 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of $15,454,294 for the prior fiscal year. Cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily the result of net income, and an increase in both accounts payable and accrued expenses and wages in the amount of $6,885,498 and $2,436,532, respectively. Cash flow from operating activities was offset by an increase in both inventory and prepaid expenses and other assets in the amount of $12,072,227 and $9,101,731, respectively. The increase in accounts payable is the result of more favorable payment terms with vendors. The increase in inventory is the result of an increase in purchases to satisfy customer orders. Further, capacity issues in the component industry made it difficult to obtain some components to complete assemblies for shipping.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $15,454,294 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020. Cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily the result of net income and an increase in accounts payable in the amount of $10,143,939. The increase in accounts payable is the result of more favorable payment terms with vendors. Cash flow provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.
Investing Activities.
In fiscal year 2021, cash used in investing activities was $10,228,816. During fiscal year 2021 the Company purchased $4,747,316 in machinery and equipment to be used in the ordinary course of business. The Company has received forecasts from current customers for increased business that would require additional investment in capital equipment and facilities. To the extent that these forecasts come to fruition, the Company anticipates that it will make additional machinery and equipment purchases up to $6,500,000 in fiscal year 2022. The Company anticipates purchases will be funded by lease transactions. However, there is no assurance that such
increased business will be obtained or that the Company will be able to obtain funding or leases at acceptable terms, if at all, in the future. In fiscal year 2021, the Company made advances of $5,481,500 to Wagz. As more fully described in Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in June 2020, the Company announced a proposed business combination with Wagz. The advances were made in conjunction with the proposed business combination.
In fiscal year 2020, the Company purchased in cash $4,646,325 in machinery and equipment to be used in the ordinary course of business. The Company purchases were funded by the bank line of credit and lease transactions.
Financing Activities.
Cash used in financing activities was $1,140,346 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021. Cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of net payments under finance leases and sale leaseback agreements.
Cash used in financing activities was $4,265,834 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020. Cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of net payments under the line of credit offset by the proceeds from the PPP Loan of $6,282,973.

Notes Payable - Banks
Prior to January 29, 2021, the Company had a senior secured credit facility with U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”). The revolving credit facility allowed the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (i) $45,000,000 (the “Revolving Line Cap”) less reserves or (ii) the Borrowing Base, but no more than 80% of the Company’s Revolving Line Cap. Prior to its payoff and termination, the U.S. Bank senior secured credit facility was due to expire on March 31, 2022. On January 29, 2021, the Company paid the balance outstanding under the senior secured credit facility in the amount of $25,574,733. The unamortized deferred financing costs of $158,476 were expensed in fiscal year 2021 upon extinguishment of the debt.
On January 29, 2021, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Lender”), pursuant to which Lender has agreed to provide the Company with a secured credit facility maturing on January 29,2026, of which (a) up to $50,000,000 is available on a revolving loan basis, and
(b) an aggregate of $6,500,000 was borrowed pursuant to two term loans (the “Facility”). The Facility is secured by substantially all of SigmaTron’ assets including mortgages on its two Illinois properties.
The Facility allows the Company to choose among interest rates at which it may borrow funds for revolving loans: “CBFR Loans,” the interest on which is based on (A) the “REVLIBOR30 Rate” (as defined in the Agreement) unless the REVLIBOR30 Rate is not available, in which case the interest is generally the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the U.S., plus (B) an applicable margin of 2.0% (effectively 2.25% per annum at April 30, 2021); or “Eurodollar Loans,” the interest on which is based on (X) an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Agreement) for any interest period multiplied by the Standard Reserve Rate (as defined in the Agreement) plus (Y) an applicable margin of 2.0%. Under the revolving portion of the Facility, the Company may borrow up to the lesser of (i) $50,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the inventory borrowing base. The Facility is collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company. Under the Agreement, a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (“FCCR”) financial covenant of 1.10x is applicable only during an FCCR trigger period which occurs when (i) an event of default (as defined in the Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, and Lender has elected to impose a FCCR trigger period upon notice to the Company or (ii) availability falls below the greater of (a) 10% of the revolving commitment and (b) the outstanding principal amount of the term loans. The Company was not in a FCCR trigger period as of April 30, 2021. Deferred financing costs of $361,734 were capitalized during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 and will be amortized over the term of the Agreement. As of April 30, 2021, there was $24,967,668 outstanding and $15,947,990 of unused availability under the revolving Facility compared to an outstanding balance of $26,884,494 and $13,850,575 of unused availability under the U.S. Bank senior secured credit facility at April 30, 2020. As of April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020, the unamortized amount offset against outstanding debt was $343,890 and $218,062, respectively.
On April 23, 2020, the Company received a PPP loan from U.S. Bank, as lender, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, as administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) in the amount of $6,282,973 (the “PPP Loan”). The PPP Loan, matures on April 23, 2022. No additional collateral or guarantees were provided by the Company for the PPP Loan. The PPP Loan provides for customary events of default. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness may be available for the sum of documented payroll costs, rent payments, mortgage interest and covered utilities during the Covered Period, as defined by the SBA. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if recipients terminate employees or reduce salaries during the covered period. The Company submitted its loan forgiveness application on March 26, 2021. The Company was notified of the forgiveness of the PPP Loan by the SBA on July 9, 2021 and it covers all principal and accrued interest. The accounting for the forgiveness will be reflected in the Company’s first quarter financial statements for fiscal year 2022. The Company will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and it cannot provide any assurance that it will be eligible for loan forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. All aspects of the PPP Loan are subject to review by the SBA, including without limitation, the Company’s eligibility for and the size of the loan. If, despite the Company’s actions and certification that it satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, it is later determined that it violated applicable laws or was otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, it may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties and interest. To the extent that all or part of the PPP Loan is not forgiven, the Company will be required to make payments, including interest accruing at an annual interest rate of 1.0%, beginning on the date of disbursement.
On March 15, 2019, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank. On January 26, 2021, the agreement was amended. Under the agreement SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. can borrow up to 9,000,000 Renminbi, approximately $1,380,000 as of April 30, 2021, and the facility is collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.’s manufacturing building. Interest is payable monthly and the facility bears a fixed interest rate of 3.85% per annum. The term of the facility extends to January 6, 2022. There was $824,159 outstanding under the facility at April 30, 2021 compared to an outstanding balance of $304,658 at April 30, 2020.
Notes Payable - Buildings
The Company entered into a mortgage agreement on December 21, 2017, in the amount of $5,200,000, with U.S. Bank to refinance the property that serves as the Company’s corporate headquarters and its Illinois manufacturing facility in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.
