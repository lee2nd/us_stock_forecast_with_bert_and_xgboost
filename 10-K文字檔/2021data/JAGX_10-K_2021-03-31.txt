ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report.
Overview
Jaguar was founded in San Francisco, California as a Delaware corporation on June 6, 2013. Napo formed Jaguar to develop and commercialize animal health products. Effective as of December 31, 2013, Jaguar was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Napo, and Jaguar was a majority-owned subsidiary of Napo until the close of our initial public offering on May 18, 2015. On July 31, 2017, the merger of Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. and Napo became effective, at which point Jaguar Animal Health’s name changed to Jaguar Health, Inc. and Napo began operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jaguar focused on human health and the ongoing commercialization of, and development of follow-on indications for Mytesi. Most of the activities of the Company are now focused on the commercialization of Mytesi and development of follow-on indications for crofelemer and a second-generation anti-secretory product, lechlemer that has yet to be approved by the FDA. In the field of animal health, we have limited activities which are focused on developing and commercializing first-in-class gastrointestinal products for dogs, dairy calves, foals, and high value horses.
We believe Jaguar is poised to realize a number of synergistic, value adding benefits-an expanded pipeline of potential blockbuster human follow-on indications of crofelemer, and a second-generation anti-secretory agent, as well as a pipeline of potential animal health indications for crofelemer-upon which to build global partnerships. As previously announced, Jaguar, through Napo, now holds extensive global rights for Mytesi, and crofelemer manufacturing is being conducted at a multimillion-dollar commercial manufacturing facility. Additionally, several of the drug product candidates in Jaguar’s Mytesi pipeline are backed by what we believe are strong Phase 2 and proof of concept evidence from completed human clinical trials.
Mytesi is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory agent which has a basic normalizing effect locally on the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders. Mytesi is in development for multiple possible follow-on indications, including CTD; orphan-drug indications for CDD and SBS; supportive care for IBD; IBS; and for idiopathic/functional diarrhea. Additionally, the Company is exploring the conditional marketing authorization regulatory pathway in Europe to support development and commercialization of crofelemer for the proposed indication of treatment of diarrhea associated with COVID-19, and a second-generation proprietary anti-secretory agent, lechlemer, is in development for cholera. Crofelemer previously received orphan-drug designation for the use of crofelemer in the treatment of SBS.
Financial Operations Overview
On a consolidated basis, we have not yet generated enough revenue to date to achieve break even or positive cash flow, and we expect to continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses. Our net loss was $33.8 million and $38.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had total stockholders' equity of $17.2 million, an accumulated deficit of $166.9 million, and cash of $8.1 million. We expect to continue to incur losses and experience increased expenditures for the foreseeable future as we expand our product development activities, seek necessary approvals for our product candidates, conduct species-specific formulation studies for our non-prescription products, establish API manufacturing capabilities and begin additional commercialization activities.
Revenue
Our product and collaboration revenue consists of the following:
● Revenues from the sale of our human drug Mytesi, which is sold through distributors and wholesalers.
● Revenues from the sale of our animal products branded as Neonorm Calf and Neonorm Foal. Our Neonorm and Botanical extract products are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell the products to the end customers.
● Our policy typically permits returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used when received by the customer if the product has expired. Returns are accepted for product that will expire within six months or that have expired up to one year after their expiration dates. Estimates for expected returns of expired products are based primarily on an ongoing analysis of our historical return patterns.
See “Results of Operations” below for more detailed discussion on revenues
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of direct drug substance and drug product materials expense, direct labor, distribution fees, royalties and other related expenses associated with the sale of our products.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical and contract manufacturing expense, personnel and related benefit expense, stock-based compensation expense, employee travel expense and reforestation expenses. Clinical and contract manufacturing expense consists primarily of costs to conduct stability, safety and efficacy studies, and manufacturing startup expenses at an outsourced API provider in Italy. It also includes expenses with a third-party provider for the transfer of the Mytesi manufacturing process, and the related feasibility and validation activities.
We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs. We track outsourced development costs by prescription drug product candidate and non-prescription product but do not allocate personnel or other internal costs related to development to specific programs or development compounds.
The timing and amount of our research and development expenses will depend largely upon the outcomes of current and future trials for our prescription drug product candidates as well as the related regulatory requirements, the outcomes of current and future species-specific formulation studies for our non-prescription products, manufacturing costs and any costs associated with the advancement of our line extension programs. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future development activities.
The duration, costs and timing of trials, formulation studies and development of our prescription drug and non-prescription products will depend on a variety of factors, including:
● the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing, as well as any additional clinical trials, formulation studies and other research and development activities;
● future clinical trial and formulation study results;
● potential changes in government regulations; and
● the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a prescription drug product candidate or non-prescription product could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with our development activities.
We expect research and development expense to increase due to the start-up costs associated with our clinical trials for other indications.
Sales and Marketing Expense
Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related benefit expense, stock-based compensation expense, direct sales and marketing expense, employee travel expense, and management consulting expense. We currently incur sales and marketing expenses to promote Mytesi. We do not currently have any marketing or promotional expenses related to Neonorm Calf or Neonorm Foal for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
We expect sales and marketing expense to increase going forward as we focus on expanding our market access activities and commercial partnerships for the development of follow-on indications of Mytesi and crofelemer.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related benefit expense, stock-based compensation expense, employee travel expense, legal and accounting fees, rent and facilities expense, and management consulting expense.
In the near term, we expect general and administrative expense to remain flat as we focus on our pipeline development and market access expansion. This will include efforts to grow the business.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of non-cash and cash interest costs related to our borrowings.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require significant judgments and estimates. For additional information relating to these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, appearing elsewhere in this report.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
We recognize revenue in accordance with the core principle of ASC 606 or when there is a transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
We recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.
We do not to adjust the amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the expected period between the transfer of promised goods or services and customer payment is one year or less.
We have elected to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs.
Additionally, we have elected to record revenue net of sales and other similar taxes.
Contracts - Cardinal Health
Effective January 16, 2019, Napo engaged Cardinal Health as its exclusive third party logistics distribution agent for commercial sales for the Company’s Mytesi product and to perform certain other services which include, without limitation, storage, distribution, returns, customer support, financial support, Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) and system access support (Exclusive Distribution Agreement).
In addition to the terms and conditions of the Exclusive Distribution Agreement, Cardinal Health’s purchase of products, and assumption of title therein, is set forth in the Title Model Addendum. The Title Model Addendum states that upon receipt of product at the 3PL Facility (Cardinal Health in La Vergne, Tennessee) from the Company, title and risk of loss for the Mytesi product purchased by Cardinal Health (excluding consigned inventory) shall pass to Cardinal Health, and title and risk of loss for consigned inventory shall remain with Napo until purchased by Cardinal Health in accordance with this Addendum. Napo considers Cardinal Health the Company’s exclusive customer for Mytesi products per the Cardinal Health Exclusive Distribution Agreement.
Jaguar’s Neonorm and botanical extract products are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell the products to the end customers. Since 2014, we entered into several distribution agreements with established distributors such as Animart, Vedco, VPI, RJ Matthews, Henry Schein, and Stockmen Supply to distribute the Company's products in the United States, Japan, and China. The distribution agreements and the related purchase order together meet the contract existence criteria under ASC 606-10-25-1. Jaguar sells directly to its customers without the use of an agent.
Performance obligations
For animal products sold by Jaguar, the single performance obligation identified above is the Company’s promise to transfer the Company’s animal products to distributors based on specified payment and shipping terms in the arrangement. Product warranties are assurance-type warranties that do not represent a performance obligation. For the Company’s human product, Mytesi, which is sold by Napo, the single performance obligation identified above is the Company’s promise to transfer Mytesi to Cardinal Health, the Company’s exclusive distributor for the product, based on specified payment and shipping terms as outlined in the Exclusive Distribution Agreement.
Transaction price
For contracts with Cardinal Health, for both Jaguar and Napo, the transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to collect in exchange for transferring promised goods or services. The transaction price of Mytesi and Neonorm is the Wholesaler Acquisition Cost (“WAC”), net of estimated discounts, returns, and price adjustments.
Allocate transaction price
For contracts with Cardinal Health, for both Jaguar and Napo, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation contained in each contract.
Revenue recognition
For contracts with Cardinal Health, for both Jaguar and Napo, a single performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time, upon the free on board (“FOB”) terms of each contract when control, including title and all risks, has transferred to the customer.
Disaggregation of Product Revenue
Human
Sales of Mytesi are recognized as revenue when the products are delivered to the wholesaler. Net revenues from the sale of Mytesi were $9.3 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Animal
The Company recognized Neonorm revenues of $76,000 and $102,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues are recognized upon shipment, which is when title and control is transferred to the buyer. Sales of Neonorm Calf and Foal to distributors are made under agreements that may provide distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances.
Contracts - Atlas Sciences, LLC
Effective April 15, 2020, the Company entered into a patent purchase agreement with Atlas Sciences, LLC (“Atlas”), pursuant to which Atlas agreed to purchase certain patents and patent applications relating to Napo’s
NP-500 drug product candidate (the “Patent Rights”) for an upfront cash payment of $1.5 million.
Concurrent with the Patent Rights sale, the Company entered into a license agreement with Atlas (the “License Agreement”), pursuant to which Atlas granted the Company an exclusive 10-year license to use the Patent Rights and improvements thereon to develop and commercialize NP-500 in all territories worldwide except Greater China (i.e., China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau), inclusive of the right to sublicense NP-500 development and commercialization rights (“The License”).
Included in the arrangement with Atlas, the Company was obligated to initiate a proof of concept Phase 2 study of NP-500 under an investigational new drug (“IND”) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or an IND-equivalent dossier under appropriate regulatory authorities (the “Phase 2 study”) within nine months of
April 15, 2020. The Company would incur a trial delay fee if the Company failed to initiate the Phase 2 study by this date, for any reason, including the timely receipt of adequate funding to initiate the Phase 2 study. Atlas had the right to terminate the License in the event that the Company (i) failed to complete the Phase 2 study within five years of
April 15, 2020 or (ii) had not timely initiated the Phase 2 study and thereafter failed to make three or more consecutive trial delay payments.
Performance obligations
The Patent Rights sale to Atlas and the Phase 2 study to be performed by the Company, identified above, represent a single transaction with two separate performance obligations; with the sale of the Patent Rights, the Company transferred control of the internally generated Patent Rights to Atlas at the date of sale.
Transaction price
For the contract with Atlas, the upfront payment of $1.5 million from Atlas as consideration for the Patent Rights sale and the Phase 2 study, is variable consideration that is fully constrained due to the potential incurrence of a Trial Delay Fee of $2.5 million if the Phase 2 study had not been initiated by January 15, 2021. The Company’s
method for estimating the variable consideration was to use the most likely amount method. The Company fully constrained the value of the variable consideration based on inherent uncertainty of timing of clinical trials. Accordingly, at inception, the total transaction price of $1.5 million is deferred and the transaction price is zero.
Allocate transaction price
For the contract with Atlas, the transaction price of $1.5 million as follows: (i) $1.0 million was allocated to the Phase 2 study using the cost-plus margin approach based on the price quoted by a third-party contract research organization, and (ii) $529,000 was allocated to the Patent sale using the Residual method.
Revenue recognition
For the contract with Atlas, control of the Patent Rights transferred to Atlas on the date of sale (at a point-in-time); and with the Phase 2 study, the services were to be transferred to Atlas over the estimated 13.2 months of the study, which was set to run between October 2020 and November 2021.
In September 2020, the Company made the decision not to initiate the Phase 2 study and intended to negotiate the payment of the trial delay fee of $2.5 million and terminate this obligation in the contract. Because of this decision, the allocated transaction price for that performance obligation will not be recognized as revenue. Likewise, the allocated transaction price for the Patent sale will not be recognized as revenue, as its recognition was dependent on initiating the Phase 2 study on or before January 15, 2021.
The Company derecognized $1.5 million in deferred revenue and the excess of the trial delay fee was recognized in "General and Administrative Expenses" in the consolidated statements of operations. The payment was deemed not in exchange for a distinct good or service.
The Company evaluated the nature of the consideration payable to the customer and the rights and obligations in the related contract and concluded that the excess payment or loss should be presented as part of the "General and Administrative Expenses" due to the following factors:
● No revenue has been recognized from the transaction as performance obligations were not satisfied.
● The Company settled the trial delay fee in full in October 2020, which constitutes termination of the customer relationship considering that Atlas cannot compel the Company or has no recourse to force the Company to initiate the Phase 2 Study. The Company does not anticipate future revenue contract with Atlas.
● The trial delay fee is a penalty in its economic term, subject to accounting for contingencies and provisions under relevant authoritative guidance.
In October 2020, the Company entered into a fee settlement agreement with Atlas pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue 2,000,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 6,218,954 shares of common stock as complete settlement and satisfaction of the trial delay fee of $2.5 million that the Company incurred pursuant to its license agreement with Atlas dated April 15, 2020. The pre-funded warrants were exercisable immediately and could be exercised at any time until all of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in full. The nominal exercise price of each pre-funded warrant was $0.0001. The settlement resulted to a loss amounting to $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the shares of common stock have all been issued and the pre-funded warrants have all been exercised.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
Acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) are intangible assets initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated
research and development efforts. During the development period, these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings; instead these assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. In connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment in which indicators of impairment have been identified, we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on the consolidated balance sheet. If impairment is indicated by this test, the intangible asset is written down by the amount by which the discounted cash flows expected from the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgement and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other factors. If current expectations of growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, this may lead to a further impairment in the future. Based on the results of the impairment test, the Company recorded an impairment charge of zero and $4.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the asset’s fair value.
Modifications to Liability-classified Instruments
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company modified certain debt instruments and Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock which is a liability-classified preferred stock (see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements). In accounting for debt modifications and exchange transactions, it is the Company’s policy to first determine whether it qualifies as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) pursuant to the guidance provided in ASC 470-60. A debt modification or exchange transaction that is not within the scope of the ASC 470-60 is accounted for under ASC 470-50 to determine if the transaction is a mere modification or an extinguishment.
Modifications to Equity-classified Instruments
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company modified certain equity-classified warrants (see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements). It is the Company’s policy to determine the impact of modifications to equity-classified warrants by analogy to the share-based compensation guidance of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). The model for a modified share-based payment award that is classified as equity and remains classified in equity after the modification is addressed in ASC 718-20-35-3. Pursuant to that guidance, the incremental fair value from the modification is recognized as an expense in the statements of operations to the extent the modified instrument has a higher fair value; however, in certain circumstances, such as when an entire class of warrants are modified, the measured increase in fair value may be more appropriately recorded as a deemed dividend, depending upon the nature of the warrant modification.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company modified the terms of its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series 1, 2 and Bridge Note Warrants in one transaction (see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements) and Series C Perpetual Preferred Stock (see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements). For amendments to preferred stock, it is the Company’s policy to measure the impact by analogy to ASC 470-50 in determining if such an amendment is an extinguishment or a modification. If the amendment results in an extinguishment, the Company follows the SEC staff guidance in ASC 260-10-S99-2 and ASC 470-20.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes the Company’s results of operations with respect to the items set forth in such table for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 together with the change in such items in dollars and as a percentage.
Revenue
Product revenue
The increase in product revenue of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to the list price adjustment of Mytesi that occurred in April 2020.
Due to the Company’s arrangements, including elements of variable consideration, gross product sales are reduced in order to reflect the expected consideration to arrive at net product sales. Deductions to reduce gross product sales to net product sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:
Cost of Product Revenue
The decrease in cost of product revenue of $536,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
● Material costs decreased $345,000 from $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.8 million in 2020 mainly consisting of a decrease of $166,000 in Mytesi inventory sold, a year-end contractual credit of $93,000 received from the Company’s contract manufacturer, and a campaign batch cancelation fee of $78,000.
● Other costs decreased $374,000 from $656,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $282,000 in mainly consisting of $115,000 less in write-offs of non-conforming inventory, and a decrease in equipment maintenance of $55,000.
Research and Development Expense
The following table presents the components of research and development (“R&D”) expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The change in R&D expense of $593,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to:
● Other expenses increased $881,000 from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.1 million in 2020 mainly consisting of consulting, formulation and regulatory fees. Consulting expenses increased $775,000 due to an increase in clinical trial consultants, which is consistent with the increased activity in development of multiple follow-on indications for Mytesi. Direct R&D testing costs also increased $25,000 due to an increase in R&D work.
● Stock-based compensation decreased $120,000 from $869,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $749,000 in 2020 primarily due to higher prior year expense incurred for options granted with upfront vesting to existing employees.
● Travel, other expenses decreased $119,000 from $164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $45,000 in 2020 due to reduced travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
● Clinical and contract manufacturing expenses decreased $86,000 from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.7 million in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in contract manufacturing costs for enhanced manufacturing process improvements.
Sales and Marketing Expense
The following table presents the components of sales and marketing (“S&M”) expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The change in S&M expense of $327,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to:
● Personnel and related benefits decreased $875,000 from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $3.3 million in 2020 due to sales force reduction.
● Other expenses decreased $302,000 from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $879,000 in 2020 due to reduced travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
● Direct marketing and sales expense increased $791,000 from $1.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to $2.2 million in 2020 due to an increase in marketing programs for Mytesi related to the expanding market access through specialty pharmacy channels.
General and Administrative Expense
The following table presents the components of general and administrative (“G&A”) expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The change in G&A expenses of $885,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to:
● Other general and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million from $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4.8 million in 2020 largely due to $1.0 million charge for Atlas trial delay penalty, an increase in state business and manufacturing licenses of $90,000, and $306,000 increase of D&O liability insurance.
● Legal services increased $554,000 from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.4 million in 2020 primarily due to $218,000 increase in fees related to legal proceedings, $243,000 increase in fees related to addressing a congressional inquiry, and $59,000 increase in promotional material compliance review to support increase in marketing programs for Mytesi, and $70,000 increase in patent related legal fees.
● Public company expenses increased $528,000 from $651,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.2 million in 2020 largely due to $460,000 increase in investor relations and communications consulting expenses and $76,000 in underwriter settlement agreement costs.
● Third-party consulting fees decreased $1.2 million from $2.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to $845,000 in 2020. This was primarily due to the restructuring initiatives implemented in the Finance and Accounting department.
● Travel, other expenses decreased $207,000 from $245,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $38,000 in 2020 due to reduced travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
● Audit, tax and accounting services fees decreased $109,000 from $815,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to $706,000 in 2020, mostly due to change in the timing of services received.
● Rent and lease expense decreased $106,000 from $796,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $690,000 in 2020 primarily due to the move of the Company’s administrative headquarters in August 2020 that resulted in lower recurring rent expense.
● Stock-based compensation expense decreased $104,000 from $2.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to $1.9 million in 2020 due to an increase in the volume of option grants.
Settlement of Tempesta Royalty License Agreement
A royalty license agreement settlement liability decreased from $649,000 in the year ended
December 31, 2019 to zero in 2020. In October 2019, the Company and Tempesta settled a dispute, pursuant to which Tempesta received $50,000 in cash, an unsecured promissory note issued by the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $550,000 and 40,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for the cessation of all royalty payments by Napo to Dr. Tempesta under the License Agreements.
Impairment of Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
Acquired IPR&D are intangible assets initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the development period, these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings; instead these assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. The Company recorded an impairment of indefinite-lived assets of zero and $4.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the asset’s fair value.
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Inducement Expense
On March 24, 2020, the Company entered into a Warrant Exercise and Preferred Stock Amendment Agreement with a holder of its Series 2 warrants previously issued in the Company’s registered public offering on July 23, 2019, pursuant to which the holder agreed to exercise in cash its warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of common stock, at a reduced exercise price of $0.5227 per share for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $653,000. As further inducement to enter into the Amendment Agreement, the Company agreed to reduce the conversion price of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock from $2.00 to $0.4456. The modification of the conversion price of the Series B Convertible Preferred shares were qualitatively considered an extinguishment and the Company followed the guidance in ASC 260-10-S99-2 and recorded an expense of $1.6 million and derecognizing the Series B Convertible Preferred shares.
Series 3 Warrants Inducement Expense
In May 2020, concurrent with the May 2020 modification of the exercise price of the Series 1, Series 2 and Bridge Warrants and inducement offer, the Company issued unregistered Series 3 Warrants to purchase 8,670,852 shares of common stock. The Series 3 Warrants have an exercise price of $0.53 per share and are exercisable beginning the earlier of (i) six months from their May 22, 2020 issuance date and (ii) receipt of the requisite Stockholder Approval (defined below), and expire five years thereafter. In addition to the fixed settlement method at
$0.53 per warrant share, the Series 3 Warrants have two contingent settlement methods: (i) if at the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement, then the holders of the 8,670,852 warrants may exercise the warrants in a “cashless exercise,” under which the holders will receive the aggregate warrants less the number of warrants equal to the exercise price; or (ii) a cashless exercise feature wherein, regardless if there is an effective registration statement, following the requisite Stockholder Approval, each such Series 3 Warrant will be exercisable into one share of common stock for no consideration (the “Alternate Cashless Exercise”).
The Series 3 Warrants were initially valued at $3.7 million using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model as follows: probability-weighted exercise price of $0.05 per share, stock price of $0.44 per share, expected life of 5.50 years, volatility of 141%, and a risk-free rate of 0.34%. The Series 3 Warrants were classified as liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
A Special Meeting of Stockholders was held on July 21, 2020, whereupon a proposal to approve the “Alternate Cashless Exercise” settlement method for the Series 3 Warrants was approved.
In 2020, certain holders of the Series 3 Warrants agreed to exercise a total of 8,456,352 shares for a 1-for-1 exchange of common shares in an Alternate Cashless Exercise. The aggregate fair value of the common stock issued upon the exercise of the Series 3 Warrants as of the exercise date was $6.1 million.
As of December 31, 2020, the remaining Series 3 Warrants are valued at $175,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with inputs as follows: probability-weighted exercise price of $0 per share, stock price of $0.815 per share, expected life of 4.89 years, volatility of 142%, and a risk-free rate of 0.36%.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense decreased $2.9 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.8 million in 2020 primarily due to interest expense incurred on the March 2019 Bridge Notes and interest expense incurred on warrants issued concurrently.
Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Change in fair value of financial instruments increased $3.7 million from a gain of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a loss of $2.7 million in 2020 entirely due to losses incurred on the change in fair value of liability classified warrants.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and Exchange of Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock
The loss on extinguishment of debt and conversion of Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock decreased $3.0 million from $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.9 million in 2020 is due to the following:
● During 2019, the Company recorded $2.6 million in extinguishment losses from exchanges of principal and related accrued interest for shares of the Company’s common stock;
● In May 2019, the Company recorded a $2.0 million extinguishment loss from the exchange of the two outstanding Napo convertible notes for Exchange Note 1 and Exchange Note 2; and
● In July 2019, the Company recorded a $336,000 extinguishment loss from paying off twenty-one Bridge Notes prior to maturity;
● During 2020, the Company recorded a $560,000 extinguishment loss from exchanges of the outstanding Exchange Note 1 for shares of the Company’s common stock; and
● In December 2020, the Company recorded a $1.3 million loss from exchanges of Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock for shares of the Company’s common stock.
Deemed Dividend Attributable to Accretion of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
The Company recorded a deemed dividend charge of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $894,000 in 2019, for the accretion of the redemption amount and carrying value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
Deemed Dividend Attributable to Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
On the July 23, 2019 issuance date, the effective conversion price per share was less than the fair value of the underlying common stock. As a result, the Company determined that there was a beneficial conversion feature of $4.2 million. Because the Company's Series B Preferred Stock does not have a stated conversion date and was immediately convertible at the issuance date, the Company recorded a deemed dividend charge of $4.2 million for the accretion of the discount on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
Deemed Dividend Attributable to Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock
On October 3 and October 9, 2019, in two separate transactions, the Company exercised its purchased put option, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, to require the Exercising Holder to exercise all of its 1,250,000 Series 1 warrants, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, upon which the Company issued 1,250,000 common shares to the Exercising Holder in return for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,750,000. In consideration (the strike price) of the exercising the warrants, the Company issued 63 shares of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock to the Exercising Holder. On the issuance dates, the effective conversion price was less than the fair value of the underlying common stock. As a result, the Company determined that there was a total beneficial conversion feature of $530,000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net losses of $33.8 million and $38.5 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in the near-term future. At December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $166.9 million. To date, we have generated only limited revenue, and we may never achieve revenue sufficient to offset our expenses.
We had cash of $8.1 million as of December 31, 2020. We believe our current capital is sufficient to fund our operating plan through one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
The Company has funded operations primarily through the issuance of equity and debt financing, in addition to sales of commercial products. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 are as follows:

We expect our expenditures will continue to increase as we continue our efforts to develop our products and continue development of our pipeline in the near term. We believe our current capital is sufficient to fund our operating plan through one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. We may also not be successful in entering into partnerships that include payment of upfront licensing fees for our products and product candidates for markets outside the United States, where appropriate. If we do not generate upfront fees from any anticipated arrangements, including but not limited to the contemplated merger transaction between the Dragon SPAC and Napo EU and associated licensing arrangement that is currently under discussions, it would have a negative effect on our operating plan. We plan to finance our operations and capital funding needs through equity and/or debt financing as well as revenue from future product sales. However, there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms on a timely basis, if at all, or that we will generate sufficient cash from operations to adequately fund operating needs or ultimately achieve profitability. If we are unable to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for the long-term development and commercialization of our products, we will need to curtail planned activities and reduce costs. Doing so will likely have an adverse effect on our ability to execute on our business plan.
