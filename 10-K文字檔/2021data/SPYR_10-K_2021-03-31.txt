Plan of Operations
SPYR®, Inc. acts as a holding company to develop a portfolio of profitable subsidiaries, not limited by any particular industry or business.
With our October 20, 2020, acquisition of Applied Magix, a Nevada corporation (“Applied Magix”), our business model changed to focus on the development of our wholly owned subsidiary Applied Magix Inc., a registered Apple® developer, and reseller of Apple® ecosystem compatible products and accessories with an emphasis on the smart home market. As such, we are in the global “Internet of Things” (IoT) market, and more specifically, the segment of the market related to the development, manufacture and sale of devices and accessories specifically built on Apple’s HomeKit® framework. These products work within the Apple® HomeKit® ecosystem and are exclusive to the Apple market and its consumers. Apple® HomeKit® is a system that lets users control smart home devices, so long as they're compatible with the HomeKit® ecosystem, giving users control over smart thermostat, lights, locks and more in multiple rooms, creating comfortable environments and remote control of other connected devices. Our strategy is two-fold. First, we intend to resell, under our Applied Magix brand, a variety of chargers, cables, cords, charging docks, cases, cameras, adaptors and other accessories used in the Apple® ecosystem in various internet marketplaces. Secondly, we are developing an Applied Magix branded hardware device for use with the Apple HomeKit® framework, that will allow users to program and securely control and manage multiple smart home devices labeled as a "Works with Apple HomeKit” accessory through the Apple® HomeKit® app for iOS. To date, our strategy is in the development stage. We have yet to begin sales efforts for our branded Apple® ecosystem compatible products and accessories, and our Apple HomeKit® hardware device is in development.
We will also continue to identify and target acquisitions, which will grow our footprint in the technology industry and expand the products we offer consumers, including companies developing artificial intelligence and smart-technology products.
The Company intends to utilize cash on hand, shareholder loans and other forms of financing such as the sale of additional equity and debt securities, capital leases and other credit facilities to conduct its ongoing business, and to also conduct strategic business development, marketing analysis, due diligence investigations into possible acquisitions, and implementation of our Applied Magix business plans generally. The Company also seeks to diversify, through acquisition or otherwise, in other related and/or unrelated business areas and is exploring opportunities to do so.
Comparison of 2020 To 2019
The consolidated results of continuing operations are as follows:
Results of Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company had a loss from continuing operations of $2,947,000 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $1,719,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change is due primarily to increases in labor and related expenses of $1,306,000, depreciation and amortization of $1,000, professional fees of $6,000, research and development of $14,000 and decreases in revenues of $117,000, rent of $32,000 and other general and administrative costs of $60,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company also had increases in other expenses of $123,000.
More detailed explanation of the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 changes are included in the following discussions.
Total Revenues - For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total revenue of $185,000 and $302,000, respectively, for a decrease of $117,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company received $185,000 in revenue for professional services rendered to related parties, all of which was received during the period from January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company received $302,000 in revenue for professional services rendered to related parties. Since March 31, 2020, the Company has not and does not anticipate that it will provide any further professional services to related parties. Our current business is focused on the development of our wholly owned subsidiary, Applied Magix.
Labor and related expenses include the costs of salaries, wages, leased employees, contract labor, and the fair value of common stock and options granted to employees and directors for services. For the year ended December 31, 2020 the company had total labor and related expenses of $2,030,000 with $302,000 being settled in cash, $393,000 in accrued salaries and $1,335,000 being paid in restricted common stock and options recorded at fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2019 the company had total labor and related expenses of $724,000 with $289,000 being settled in cash, $292,000 in accrued salaries and $143,000 being paid in restricted stock recorded at fair value. The cost of labor is expected to increase in conjunction with the expansion of operations.
The cost of rent decreased $32,000 from $145,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $113,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company leases approximately 5,169 square feet at 4643 South Ulster Street, Denver, Colorado pursuant to an amended lease dated May 21, 2015. Under the lease, the Company pays annual base rent on an escalating scale ranging from $142,000 to $152,000. On May 1, 2020 and July 29, 2020, the Company entered into amended lease agreements with its landlord. Under the terms of the amendments, the landlord agreed to waive rent, certain rent adjustments and parking for the period April 1, 2020 through August 31, 2020 and extend the term of the lease by five months. The lease term date, which was December 31, 2020, is now May 31, 2021.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Depreciation and amortization expenses are attributable to depreciation of the property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets in service during respective periods. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in 2021 commensurate with the acquisition of additional property, equipment and intangible assets in connection with our planned Applied Magix business operations.
Professional fees increased $6,000 from $95,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $101,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Professional fees during 2020 included $92,000 in legal, accounting and other professional service needs, $6,000 in consulting services related to our Applied Magix operations, and $3,000 for public relations. Professional fees during 2019 included $85,000 in legal, accounting and other professional service needs, $10,000 for public relations.
Research and development costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 included $14,000 in connection with the research and testing of products for our Applied Magix operations, compared to $0 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other general and administrative expenses decreased $60,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease can be attributed primarily to reductions in insurance costs of $66,000 and various other general and administrative cost reductions of $24,000 offset by increases in other general and administrative costs associated with our Applied Magix operations of $30,000.
The Company had interest expense on a related party line of credit, related party short-term advances, convertible notes payable and accrued expenses of $247,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company had interest expense on a related party line of credit, related party short-term advances, convertible notes payable and accrued expenses of $247,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company sold certain office equipment for $9,000 which resulted in a loss on disposition of assets of $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company did not have a corresponding loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company recognized a gain on the acquisition of its wholly owned subsidiary Applied Magix of $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company did not have a corresponding gain for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company received a $3,000 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) grant from the U.S. Small Business Administration during the for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company did not have a corresponding grant for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company recognized a loss on the issuance of long-term convertible notes payable in the amount of $514,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company did not have a corresponding loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company recognized a gain on the change in value of a derivative liability related to its long-term convertible notes payable in the amount of $132,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company did not have a corresponding loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company accrued $500.000 in connection with litigation and legal settlement liabilities. The $500,000 liability is reported as part of accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and was recorded as litigation settlement costs on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company had unrealized losses on trading securities of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to unrealized losses of $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Unrealized gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the quoted market price of the underlying securities at the respective reporting dates.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carry-forwards, capital loss carry-overs, unrealized losses on trading securities, and deductible temporary differences of approximately $25,100,000 compared to $25,500,000 as of December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company increased its net operating loss carry-forwards by approximately $1,200,000, had capital losses carry-forwards of approximately $2,200,000 expire and increased its other deductible temporary differences by approximately $600,000. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will not be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets and has established a 100% valuation allowance of $5,280,000 against these potential future tax benefits. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly.
Discontinued Operations
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, SPYR APPS®, LLC, during the year ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2020, we engaged in the development, publication and co-publication of mobile electronic games, seeking to generate revenue through those games by way of advertising and in-app purchases. During October, 2020 the Company changed its focus away from this line of business. As of December 31, 2020, all of our games have been removed from the game stores. Pursuant to current accounting guidelines, the assets and liabilities of SPYR APPS LLC as well as the results of its operations are presented in these financial statements as discontinued operations.
Through our other wholly owned subsidiary, E.A.J.: PHL Airport, Inc., we owned and operated the restaurant “Eat at Joe’s®,” which was located in the Philadelphia International Airport since 1997. Our lease in the Philadelphia Airport expired in April 2017. Concurrent with expiration of the lease the restaurant closed. Pursuant to current accounting guidelines, the assets and liabilities of EAJ as well as the results of its operations are presented in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has generated a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3,057,000 and utilized cash in operations of $521,000. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had current assets of $577,000, which included cash and cash equivalents of $510,000, other receivables of $4,000, prepaid expenses of $49,000, trading securities of $1,000, and current assets of discontinued operations of $13,000.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company met its capital requirements through a combination of collection of receivables, proceeds from long-term convertible notes payable, proceeds of SBA PPP note payable and SBA EIDL grant, and through the use of existing cash reserves.
The Company also entered into an Equity Line of Credit pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement with Brown Stone Capital, LP, dated September 30, 2020. Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, Brown Stone agreed to invest up to $14,000,000 to purchase the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The purchase price of the common shares is the lesser of the Fixed price or Market price. The Fixed price is $0.50 per share in years 1 and 2, after the effectiveness of a registration statement, and $1.00 per share in years 3, 4 and 5 after the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the underlying shares. The Market price is 70% of the three lowest Variable Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) for the Company’s common stock during the 10 trading day period immediately prior to the conversion date. In addition, the Company and Brown Stone entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, whereby the Company agreed to provide certain registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and applicable state securities laws, with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable for Brown Stone’s investment pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement. The Equity Purchase Agreement terminates five years after the Effective Date or conditioned upon the following events: (i) when Brown Stone has purchased the maximum purchase amount; or (ii) in the event a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed concerning the Company; or, (iii) if a Custodian is appointed for the Company or if the Company makes a general assignment for all or substantially all of its property for the benefit of its creditors.
The Company currently does not have sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its anticipated working capital for the next twelve months. The Company will continue to seek additional capital through the sale of its common stock, debt financing and through expansion of its existing and new products. If these goals do not materialize as planned, we believe that the Company can reduce its operating and product development costs and that would allow us to maintain sufficient cash levels to continue operations. However, if we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future, we may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion, marketing, and product development plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.
The Company may also decide to expand and/or diversify, through acquisition or otherwise, in other related or unrelated business areas if opportunities present themselves.
Operating Activities - For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company used cash for operating activities of $521,000 and $763,000, respectively. Operating activities consist of corporate overhead and development of Applied Magix products. Decreases are due to decreases in cash-paid operating expenses. See the above results of operations discussion for more details.
Investing Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company purchased property and equipment for $15,000 and sold property and equipment for $9,000. The Company had no investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company borrowed $749,000 from related party short-term advances.
Government Regulations - The Company is subject to all pertinent federal, state, local and international laws governing its business. Each subsidiary is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of authorities in its State or municipality. These may include health, safety, and fire regulations. The Company's operations are also subject to Federal and State minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and other credits.
Critical Accounting Policies - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
We determine revenue recognition by: (1) identifying the contract, or contracts, with our customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.
Our professional services arrangements are either fixed-fee billing or time-and-material billing arrangements. In fixed-fee billing arrangements, we agree to a predetermined fee for a predetermined set of professional services. We set the fee based upon our estimate of the time and costs necessary to complete the engagements. Under time-and-materials billing arrangements, the fee is based on the number of hours worked at the agreed upon billing rates. We recognize service revenue upon completion of the service.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested, and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.
The fair value of the Company's stock option and warrant grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.
The Company also issues restricted shares of its common stock for share-based compensation programs to employees and non-employees. The Company measures the compensation cost with respect to restricted shares to employees based upon the estimated fair value at the date of the grant and is recognized as expense over the period which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. For non-employees, the Company measures the compensation cost with respect to restricted shares based upon the estimated fair value at measurement date which is either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The Company's only derivative financial instruments were embedded conversion features associated with long-term convertible notes payable which contain certain provisions that allow for a variable number of shares on conversion.
Loss Contingencies
The Company is subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
