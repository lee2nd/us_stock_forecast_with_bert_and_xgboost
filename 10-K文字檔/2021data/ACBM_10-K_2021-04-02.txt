ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report.
Overview
Because we changed our fiscal year from the year ended September 30 to the calendar year by filing a transition report on Form 10-K on March 27, 2020, we are presenting information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Since January 30, 2017, following a change of control, we have been engaged in the business of developing and marketing nutritional products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle. Our business to date has involved the purchase of products from three suppliers in Taiwan and the sale of these products to four unrelated customers, one of which accounted for all of our sales in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We did not have any sales during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 and the first three quarters of 2019. We sell product in bulk to companies who may use our products as ingredients in their products or sell the products they purchase from us to their own customers.
All of our sales to date have been sales of cordyceps related products and, in the quarter ended June 30, 2018, metallothionein MT-3 elizer. Cordyceps is a fungus that is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis has been described as a medicine in old Chinese medical books and Tibetan medicine. It is a rare combination of a caterpillar and a fungus and found at altitudes above 4500m in Sikkim. The encoded protein in metallothionein MT-3 is a growth inhibitory factor, and reduced levels of the protein are observed in the brains of individuals with some metal-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our present inventory is for cordyseps products. We have not sold metallothionein MT-3 elizer since the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and we do not have any orders for metallothionein MT-3 elizer. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell metallothionein MT-3 elizer in the future. We may also seek to market other products which we see as complimentary to our present products; however, we have not entered into negotiations with respect to the distribution of other products, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to market any other products.
All of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 represents sales to one customer which were made during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and the three months ended December 31, 2019. We believe that our failure to sell products in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 resulted substantially from the COVID - 19 pandemic and actions taken by governments to address the pandemic. We believe our failure to generate sales during the first three quarters of 2019 reflects a downturn in the market in the PRC for cordyseps products as well as the political conditions in Hong Kong, and we cannot assure you that the market will improve. We also cannot assure you the political instability in Hong Kong will not affect our sales, since our customers in 2017 and 2018 were Hong Kong based customers who sold their products in the PRC and none of these customers has made purchases from us since the quarter ended December 31, 2018. We cannot assure you that these factors will not affect our ability to generate revenues in the future and, to the extent that any of these factors affects our ability to generate revenue, we may not be able to continue in business.
At present, we have no full-time employees. Our only employee is our chief executive officer who work for us on a part-time basis. We face significant risks in implementing our business plan, as described under Item 1.Business - Proposed Business, including, but not limited to, our ability to raise the necessary financing either through the sale of debt or equity securities or through a loan facility, our ability to increase our customer base and supply chain, our ability to increase our gross margins, our ability to hire and retain qualified research and development, marketing and administrative personnel, our ability to develop products and to market in the United States and other western markets any products we may develop, our ability to comply with any government regulations relating to the manufacture, distribution and marketing any products we develop. We cannot assure you that we can or will develop any products or generate revenue or profits in the future.
Although our business plan initially contemplated that we would conduct research and development on our own proprietary products based on cordyceps sinensis, to date we have neither commenced such activities nor take any preliminary steps with respect to such activities. We do not presently have the funds necessary for us to engage in such activities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to commence any research and development activities or that any such activities that we may undertake will be successful.
We require funds for our operations. At December 31, 2020, we had $18,123 in cash and cash equivalents, $938,000 of inventory of cordyceps products. Although we may seek to raise funds in the equity market, we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any funding and we can give no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing. Because of our financial condition, the lack of sales in the six out of eight quarters in 2020 and 2019, our reliance of sales primarily of one product, along with the absence of an active market for our stock and our market capitalization in relation to our financial performance, together with risk related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the political and legal situation in Hong Kong, it may be difficult for us to raise funds in the equity market, and, if we are able to raise funds our stockholders may suffer significant dilution.
To the extent that we implement our business plan, we anticipate that we will incur marketing and other expenses without any assurance that such expenses will generate any significant revenue or net income. Because of our cash position, we may use equity-based compensation for our employees and independent contractors. In August 2020, we adopted our 2020 long-term incentive plan, pursuant to which up to 12,000,000 shares can be issued. Because of our low cash position, we may rely on loans from stockholders or related parties, although we do not have any agreements or understandings at this time and we may issue equity to attract employees and consultants to help us develop our business plan.
Effects of COVID-19
Since our products are purchased by customers in Taiwan and Hong Kong primarily as one ingredient of a product to be sold to their customers, our business has been and may continue to be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the governments of the PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as any other countries in which we may seek to sell products, as they effect manufacturers and their customers.
•
The effect of COVID-19 on the ability of our customers and potential customers to manufacture products.
•
The financial health of our potential customers.
•
Since our customers use our products as an ingredient in their products, the inability of the customer to obtain other ingredients may affect their willingness or ability to purchase our product.
•
The ability of our customers to ship their products to China and the ability of their customers to distribute product to retail markets.
•
The willingness or ability of the ultimate purchasers in the PRC and any other countries to which our customers sell products to purchase products with our ingredients and their perception as to whether the products may have beneficial effects to them.
•
The extent to which any quarantine which may be imposed affects the willingness or ability of consumers to purchase products with our ingredients.
•
The perceived benefit, if any, to consumers of products with our ingredients.
•
The extent to which the purchase of products with our ingredients is a low priority item for a population whose disposable income may have decreased as a result of COVID-19 and the steps taken by governments to curb the spread of infection.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had revenue of $687,964, representing sales to one customer in the first quarter of the year. Our gross profit was $159,404, and our gross margin was 23.2%. We had operating expenses of $289,867, primarily professional fees relating to our status as a public company and rent expense, interest expense of $5,082 and a net loss before income tax credit $135,545, an income tax credit of $18,092, and a net loss of $117,453, or $(0.00) per share (basic and diluted).
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had revenues of $193,536, representing sales to one customer during the fourth quarter of the year, which was the same customer as our sole customer in 2020. Our gross profit was $12,096, and our gross margin was 6.25%. The difference in gross margin reflected a difference in the product mix of sales. We had operating expenses of $434,847, primarily professional fees related to our status as a public company and rent expense, interest expense of $1,983, a loss before income taxes of $424,734, an income tax credit of $53,130, and a net loss of $371,604 or $(0.01) per share (basic and diluted).
We imputed interest at the rate of 4% on the advances made to the Company by stockholders in the amount of $5,082 and $1,983 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Because of our dependence on a few customers, one of which accounted for all of our sales in 2020 and 2019, our revenue in any quarter is dependent upon both the timing of orders from customers and the delivery of products from our suppliers.
Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Our revenue for three months ended December 31, 2019 was $193,536, cost of revenue was $181,440, with a gross profit of $12,096 and a gross margin of 6.25%. Our revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was $1,354,000, cost of revenue was $1,218,600, with a gross profit of $135,400 and a gross margin of 10%. We believe that the decrease in revenue resulted from political instability in Hong Kong, which has impacted our customers. The decrease in our gross margin reflected the product mix for sales made in the three months ended December 31, 2019.
Our operating expenses, consisting of selling, general and administrative expenses, for the three months ended December 31, 2019, were $87,529, as compared with $229,635 for the comparable period of 2018, which was primarily professional fees and, in the three months ended December 31, 2018, consulting fees. The consulting fees reflected stock based compensation paid to two consultants. The professional fees relate to expenses we incur as a result of our status as a public company. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had a tax credit of $19,941. We had no tax or tax credit for the three months ended December 31, 2019.
We imputed interest at the rate of 4% on the advances made to the Company by stockholders in the amount of $440 and $722 during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $75,873, or $(0.00) per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended December 31, 2019 as compared with a net loss of $75,016, or $(0.00) per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended December 31, 2018 (basic and diluted).

For the three months ended December 31, 2019 our non-cash investing and financing activities of $46,310 representing the increase in the right of use assets and lease liability of $46,310. There were no non-cash investing or financing activities in the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019 or the three months ended December 31, 2018
Going Concern
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had minimal cash as of December 31, 2020, had limited gross profit and incurred a loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
We propose to fund operations through sales of our products and equity financing arrangements. However, because of the lack of sales and the absence of any active trading market for its common stock, the lack of independent directors, our financial condition and our lack of an operating history, we may not be able to raise funds for capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements and will have to rely on advances from a minority stockholder and our officer. If we cannot generate revenue from our products, we may not be able to continue in its business.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. We had $18,123 and $911 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of finished goods. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost on the basis of first-in, first-out methods. We periodically review inventories for obsolescence and any inventories identified as obsolete are written down or written off. Although we believe that the assumptions we use to estimate inventory write-downs are reasonable, future changes in these assumptions could provide a significantly different result. No inventory markdown was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock
We adopted ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of basic earnings per share on the face of the statements of operations for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic earnings per share computation. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants unless the result would be antidilutive. There were no potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and related party payables that we will likely incur in the near future. We place our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, our cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718. For employee and non-employee stock-based awards, we calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the option-pricing model for stock options and the quoted price of its common stock for unrestricted shares; the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience.
Income Taxes
We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets, liabilities, the carry forward of operating losses and tax credits, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.
Related Parties
We follow ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which requires revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of its agreements:
·
identify the contract with a customer;
·
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
·
determine the transaction price;
·
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
·
recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
We recognize revenue when products are delivered to customers in accordance with the written sales terms.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial statements.
