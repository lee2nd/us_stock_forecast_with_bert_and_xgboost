The substantial decrease in general and administrative expense during the 2020 fiscal year was primarily due to stock-based compensation costs of $213,530 related to the issuance of stock options to our officers and certain advisors during the year ended December 31, 2019, with $409,495 in stock-based compensation to officers and advisors in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $57,632. We are in the early stage of development and have experienced net losses to date and have not generated revenue from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to commercialize potential products and generate revenue, including identifying and establishing strategic partners and technologies for the successful development of product candidates, which includes clinical trials, FDA approval, demonstration of effectiveness sufficient to generate commercial orders by customers and licensing or acquiring intellectual property, as well as effective marketing and sales capabilities for our product. We do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish any of these conditions necessary for us to generate revenue and expect to incur increasing operating expenses. We will require substantial additional funds for operations, the service of debt and to fund our business objectives. We will have to continue to rely on equity and debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing, whether debt or equity, will always be available to us in the amount required at any particular time or for any particular period or, if available, that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us. Additionally, the continued effect of COVID-19 and uncertain market conditions limit the Company’s ability to access capital. We will continue exploring sources of additional debt and equity financings as well as available grants. There is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital to pay our expenditures.
Covid-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the research and development of our product candidates. Research facilities at Dartmouth were subject to closures as well as laboratories at Ariel in Israel. This resulted in our discontinuing our research at these Universities and was part of our decision to adjust our research to be collaborative and to seek aligning with third parties to advance our expanded goals. We do not currently know the full extent of potential delays of research in the future as a result of the continuing pandemic restrictions.
COVID-19 has also caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which severely impacts our ability to raise additional capital. We terminated our employees in an effort to conserve resources in April 2020 as we evaluated our business development efforts. The ultimate impact on us and our research relationships is currently uncertain.
The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve and is subject to change. Management is actively monitoring the situation but given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company is not able to fully estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its planned operations or financial condition in the next 12 months. However, while significant uncertainty remains, the Company believes it is likely that the COVID-19 outbreak will have a negative impact on its ability to raise additional financing and will result in delays as it continues to impact the Company’s workforce and its collaborative development efforts.
Going Concern
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, does not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 includes an explanatory paragraph stating the Company has recurring losses and limited operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital due to the continued spread of COVID-19, the Company may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements.
Research and Development Costs: The Company charges research and development costs to expense when incurred in accordance with ASC 730, "Research and Development". Research and development costs were $258,620 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Research and development costs were $651,476 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Stock-Based Compensation and Other Share-Based Payments: The expense attributable to the Company's directors is recognized over the period in which the amounts are earned and vested, and the expense attributable to the Company's non-employees is recognized when vested, as described in Note 11, Stock Plan.
Warrants: The Company accounts for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815 "Derivatives and Hedging", as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. For warrants classified as equity instruments we apply the Black Scholes model. Presently all warrants issued and outstanding are accounted for using the equity method.
