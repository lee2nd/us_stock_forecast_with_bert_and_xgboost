Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "our" and "us," refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term "Celanese US" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP").
Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and other parts of this Annual Report involve both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Forward-Looking Statements
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") and other parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Generally, words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "may," "can," "could," "might," and "will," and similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views and beliefs with respect to future events at the time that the statements are made, are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Annual Report for further discussion.
COVID-19 Update
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") as a pandemic, which originated in China and has spread throughout the world to substantially all locations where we have offices, production facilities, customers and suppliers, creating a dynamic and challenging situation worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and to date has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, stay-at-home restrictions, travel restrictions and other public health and safety measures.
Our employees' health and well-being continue to be of vital importance. For employees who are working in plants and who have returned to the office, we have implemented government recommended protocols and best practices related to social distancing and best hygiene practices, including the use of additional personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning protocols, where appropriate. We have also restricted visitor access and non-essential business travel. We have a global crisis team in place monitoring the evolving situation and recommending risk mitigation actions, including workplace health and safety measures. We also have site activation teams at all locations to guide and implement our careful return-to-office efforts in accordance with government regulations and recommended protocols. Our presence in China provided us with an advance view of how COVID-19 scenarios can unfold as well as the importance of taking early action.
We operate within a geographically-balanced global footprint and have the ability to utilize different production and distribution strategies depending on the business and product to satisfy customer demands. We continue to pursue our existing operational strategy. Where we temporarily reduced run rates in prior quarters, our plants are now operating at more normalized levels, and we have been able to maintain a largely consistent supply chain. During the first half of 2020, the effects of COVID-19 and related actions to control its spread had a significant, negative impact on the operating results of our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments. However, during the second half of 2020, consumer demand for most applications increased within many regions of the world, particularly in China and the US, which have rebounded to pre-COVID-19 levels. In Engineered Materials, demand has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels for automotive and consumer goods such as electronics and appliances. Applications including food and beverage, pharma and 5G infrastructure continue to be resilient. Demand for medical applications remains at slightly reduced levels as a result of delayed elective surgeries. In the Acetyl Chain, we benefit from a highly diversified set of end-uses with less exposure, relative to others in the industry, to end markets that have been most acutely impacted by COVID-19. However, the low acetic acid pricing, along with volatility with global oil markets, presented a deflationary environment for the Acetyl Chain business for the year ended December 31, 2020. That trend began to reverse toward the end of 2020 as recent increases in raw material prices and demand levels had a beneficial impact on pricing
within the Acetyl Chain. Further, we see resiliency and even growth in some applications within all of our segments, including packaging, hygiene products, disinfectants, pharma, paints, bonding agents and cigarettes. We currently anticipate that customer demand and our results of operations should continue on a more normalized basis in 2021, assuming effective rollout of vaccines and absent a resurgence of COVID-19, as the economies in which we operate continue to recover.
We have taken, and will continue to take, actions as necessary to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We managed inventory levels, reduced our manufacturing costs and optimized our working capital. We have reduced discretionary spending such as travel and other corporate functional expenses. Although significant layoffs have not occurred within the Company during the year ended December 31, 2020, a small number of positions have been eliminated under a global restructuring program implemented largely as a result of cost cutting initiatives as part of our ongoing commitment to driving efficiencies and on which decisions were made before, and independently from, the onset of the pandemic.
We are actively managing our business to maintain cash flow, and we believe that liquidity from (i) cash generated from operations; (ii) cash on hand; (iii) dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments; and (iv) cash available from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility, will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future. We remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expect to remain in compliance based on our current expectation of future results of operations.
Capital expenditures were $364 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are expected to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million in 2021, prioritizing those projects that continue to drive productivity in the near-term. We remain fully committed to our current cash dividend. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed $650 million of share repurchases and expect to purchase approximately $400 million to $500 million of additional shares in 2021.
The extent to which COVID-19 will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted. For further information regarding the impact COVID-19 could have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. For further discussion of our liquidity condition, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Risk Factors
Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report also contains a description of certain risk factors that you should consider which could significantly affect our financial results. In addition, the following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements:
•the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the economic environment, market demand and our operations, as well as the pace of any economic recovery;
•changes in general economic, business, political and regulatory conditions in the countries or regions in which we operate;
•the length and depth of product and industry business cycles particularly in the automotive, electrical, textiles, electronics and construction industries;
•changes in the price and availability of raw materials, particularly changes in the demand for, supply of, and market prices of ethylene, methanol, natural gas, wood pulp and fuel oil and the prices for electricity and other energy sources;
•the ability to pass increases in raw material prices on to customers or otherwise improve margins through price increases;
•the ability to maintain plant utilization rates and to implement planned capacity additions, expansions and maintenance;
•the ability to reduce or maintain current levels of production costs and to improve productivity by implementing technological improvements to existing plants;
•increased price competition and the introduction of competing products by other companies;
•the ability to identify desirable potential acquisition targets and to complete acquisition or investment transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals, consistent with our strategy;
•market acceptance of our technology;
•compliance and other costs and potential disruption or interruption of production or operations due to accidents, interruptions in sources of raw materials, cyber security incidents, terrorism or political unrest, public health crises (including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 outbreak), or other unforeseen events or delays in construction or operation of facilities, including as a result of geopolitical conditions, the occurrence of acts of war or terrorist incidents or as a result of weather, natural disasters, or other crises;
•the ability to obtain governmental approvals and to construct facilities on terms and schedules acceptable to us;
•changes in applicable tariffs, duties and trade agreements, tax rates or legislation throughout the world including, but not limited to, adjustments, changes in estimates or interpretations that may impact recorded or future tax impacts associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") and potential regulatory and legislative tax developments in other jurisdictions;
•changes in the degree of intellectual property and other legal protection afforded to our products or technologies, or the theft of such intellectual property;
•potential liability for remedial actions and increased costs under existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations, including those relating to climate change;
•potential liability resulting from pending or future claims or litigation, including investigations or enforcement actions, or from changes in the laws, regulations or policies of governments or other governmental activities, in the countries in which we operate;
•changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates; and
•various other factors, both referenced and not referenced in this Annual Report.
Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond our control. COVID-19 and responses to the pandemic by governments and businesses, have significantly increased financial and economic volatility and uncertainty, exacerbating the risks and potential impact of these factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, affect us in ways or to an extent that we currently do not expect or consider to be significant, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plan Costs
The increase (decrease) in pension and other postretirement plan net periodic benefit cost for each of our business segments is as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
See Note 13 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Consolidated Results
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net sales decreased $642 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower volume in our Engineered Materials and Acetate Tow segments due to (i) depressed global economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) the expiration of an acetate flake contract; and
•lower pricing across all of our segments, primarily driven by our Acetyl Chain segment due to the reduced global customer demand environment and an overall deflationary environment for raw materials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;
partially offset by:
•a favorable currency impact resulting from a stronger Euro relative to the US dollar.
Operating profit decreased $170 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower Net sales across all of our segments; and
•higher plant turnaround and spending in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments;
partially offset by:
•lower raw material costs within our Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials segments;
•a favorable impact to Other (charges) gains, net. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a reserve of $89 million as a result of the European Commission's investigation of certain past ethylene purchases and an $83 million long-lived asset impairment loss related to the closure of our acetate flake manufacturing operations in Ocotlán, Mexico, which did not recur in the current year. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures and Note 16 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information; and
•lower energy costs across all of our segments.
Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates decreased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $31 million and $8 million from our Ibn Sina and Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd. ("KEPCO") strategic affiliates, primarily as a result of depressed global economic conditions; and
•a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $10 million from our Polyplastics strategic affiliate as a result of the sale of our 45% joint venture equity interest to our joint venture partner Daicel during the three months ended December 31, 2020. See Note 7 - Investments in Affiliates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit income increased $37 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan assets. See Note 13 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Gain (loss) on sale of investments in affiliates of $1.4 billion increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to the sale of our 45% Polyplastics joint venture equity interest. See Note 7 - Investments in Affiliates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 11% compared to 13% for the year ended 2019. The lower effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the tax impacts of certain divestitures and reorganization transactions, partially offset by tax charges related to the impacts of uncertain tax positions due to available tax attribute carryforwards and increases in the valuation allowance on US foreign tax credit carryforwards due to revised forecasts of foreign sourced income and expenses during the carryforward period. See Note 17 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, can be found in Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Reports for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Business Segments
Engineered Materials
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower volume for most of our products driven by depressed global economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•lower pricing for most of our products, primarily due to a continued reduction in customer demand, as well as customer and product mix;
partially offset by:
•a favorable currency impact resulting from a stronger Euro relative to the US dollar.
Operating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower Net sales;
•higher plant turnaround activity and associated inventory costs of $73 million, partially offset by reduced spending on lower plant production; and
•an unfavorable impact of $41 million to Other (charges) gains, net. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $26 million long-lived asset impairment loss related to certain fixed assets used in compounding operations at our facilities in Kaiserslautern, Germany; Wehr, Germany and Ferrara Marconi, Italy. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we also recorded a $15 million gain related to a settlement of a commercial dispute from a previous acquisition, which did not recur in the current year. See Note 16 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;
partially offset by:
•lower raw material costs for most of our products; and
•lower energy costs of $19 million, primarily related to favorable pricing.
Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $31 million and $8 million from our Ibn Sina and KEPCO strategic affiliates, primarily as a result of depressed global economic conditions; and
•a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $10 million from our Polyplastics strategic affiliate as a result of the sale of our 45% joint venture equity interest to our joint venture partner Daicel during the three months ended December 31, 2020.
Gain (loss) on sale of investments in affiliates of $1.4 billion increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to the sale of our 45% Polyplastics joint venture equity interest. See Note 7 - Investments in Affiliates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Acetate Tow
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower acetate flake volume, primarily due to the expiration of an acetate flake contract;
•lower acetate tow volume, consistent with global demand reduction; and
•lower acetate tow pricing, primarily due to customer mix.
Operating profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•a favorable impact of $87 million to Other (charges) gains, net. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an $83 million long-lived asset impairment loss related to the closure of our acetate flake manufacturing operations in Ocotlán, Mexico, which did not recur in the current year. See Note 16 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information; and
•lower energy costs, spending and accelerated depreciation and amortization expense of $23 million, $11 million and $10 million, respectively, primarily related to the closure of our acetate flake manufacturing unit in Ocotlán, Mexico in the prior year;
partially offset by:
•lower Net sales.
Dividend income from equity investments increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•higher earnings from our acetate tow joint ventures related to the expiration of an acetate flake contract, which was assumed by Nantong Cellulose Fibers Co. Ltd.
Acetyl Chain
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower pricing for most of our products, primarily due to the reduced global customer demand environment and an overall deflationary environment for raw materials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•lower volume for most of our products, primarily due to the reduced global customer demand environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly offset by higher volume for redispersible powders due to our acquisition of Nouryon's redispersible polymer powders business offered under the Elotex® brand ("Elotex");
partially offset by:
•a favorable currency impact, primarily related to a stronger Euro relative to the US dollar.
Operating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower Net sales;
•higher plant turnaround costs of $20 million, primarily related to our joint venture, Fairway, and Clear Lake plants; and
•higher costs of $14 million, primarily related to our acquisition of Elotex;
partially offset by:
•lower raw material costs, primarily for ethylene, acetic acid and methanol; and
•lower energy costs of $13 million, primarily related to favorable pricing.
Other Activities
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Operating loss decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•a favorable impact of $108 million to Other (charges) gains, net. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a reserve of $89 million as a result of the European Commission's investigation and a $19 million loss related to settlements with former third-party customers, which did not recur in the current year. See Note 16 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information; and
partially offset by:
•an unfavorable impact of $12 million resulting from losses on foreign currency forwards and swaps.
Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit income increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to:
•lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan assets. See Note 13 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020 we have $1.3 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations. In addition, we held cash and cash equivalents of $955 million as of December 31, 2020. We are actively managing our business to maintain cash flow, and we believe that liquidity from the above-referenced sources will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future.
While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the next twelve months. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels.
Total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $450 million to $500 million in 2021, primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities and productivity improvements primarily in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments.
On a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, Celanese US, have no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese US in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes, and to pay dividends on our Common Stock.
We are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate, such as China, India and Indonesia. Capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies, repatriate earnings or capital, lend via intercompany loans or create cross-border cash pooling arrangements. Our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in China. Pursuant to applicable regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the Chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of China, puts certain limitations on duration, purpose and amount of intercompany loans, and restricts cross-border cash pooling. While it is possible that future tightening of these restrictions or application of new similar restrictions could impact us, these limitations do not currently restrict our operations.
We remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expect to remain in compliance based on our current expectation of future results of operations. If our actual future results of operations differ materially from these expectations, or if we otherwise experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower EBITDA, we may be required to seek an amendment or waiver of such covenants which may increase our borrowing costs under those debt instruments.
Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents increased $492 million to $955 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, $578 million of the $955 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Under the TCJA, we have incurred a prior year charge associated with the deemed repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings, including foreign held cash. These funds are largely accessible without additional material tax consequences, if needed in the US, to fund operations. See Note 17 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
•Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $111 million to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.5 billion for the same period in 2019. Net cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased primarily due to:
•a decrease in Net earnings, net of the sale of our Polyplastics joint venture equity interest;
partially offset by:
•favorable trade working capital of $147 million, primarily due to a decrease in inventory and payables. Inventory decreased as a result of turnaround activity and reduced operational rates in the current year. Payables decreased as a result of timing of settlement of trade payables; and
•a decrease in incentive compensation payouts of $62 million.
•Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities increased $1.1 billion to $592 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $493 million for the same period in 2019, primarily due to:
•a net cash inflow of $1.6 billion related to the sale of our 45% Polyplastics joint venture equity interest. See Note 7 - Investments in Affiliates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;
partially offset by:
•a net cash outflow of $544 million related to the purchase of marketable securities.
•Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities increased $536 million to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $935 million for the same period in 2019, primarily due to:
•an increase in net repayments of short-term debt of $715 million, primarily as a result of higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the timing of share repurchases of our Common Stock; and
•a decrease in net proceeds of long-term debt of $169 million, primarily due to the issuance of $500 million in principal amount of the 3.500% senior unsecured notes due May 8, 2024 (the "3.500% Notes"), partially offset by the redemption of the 3.250% senior unsecured notes (the "3.250% Notes") during the year ended December 31, 2019, as discussed below;
partially offset by:
•lower share repurchases of our Common Stock of $346 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
In addition, exchange rates had a favorable impact of $28 million on cash and cash equivalents and an unfavorable impact of $2 million on cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Debt and Other Obligations
•Senior Credit Facilities
In January 2019, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiary borrowers entered into a new senior credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") consisting of a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), maturing in 2024. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese US and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries ("the Subsidiary Guarantors"). We borrowed $685 million and repaid $963 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Senior Notes
We have outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), as amended, as follows (collectively, the "Senior Notes"):
The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Celanese US may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
In May 2019, Celanese US completed an offering of the 3.500% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 3.500% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.895%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 3.500% Notes were used to redeem in full the 3.250% Notes, to repay $156 million of outstanding borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuance of the 3.500% Notes, we entered into a cross-currency swap to effectively convert our fixed-rate US dollar denominated debt under the 3.500% Notes, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate Euro denominated debt.
•Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility
On July 6, 2020, we entered into an amended and restated receivables purchase agreement (the "Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement") under our US accounts receivable securitization facility among certain of our subsidiaries, our wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary ("SPE") and certain global financial institutions ("Purchasers"). The Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement extends the term of the securitization facility such that the SPE may sell certain receivables to the Purchasers until July 2, 2021. Under the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement, transfers of accounts receivable from the SPE are treated as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the accounts receivable to the SPE. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy our creditors. On July 6, 2020, we sold $87 million of our accounts receivable and repaid $87 million of borrowings from the accounts receivable securitization facility. These sales were transacted at 100% of the face value of the relevant accounts receivable. We de-recognized $595 million of accounts receivable under this agreement through December 31, 2020. Unsold accounts receivable of $51 million were pledged by the SPE as collateral to the Purchasers as of December 31, 2020.
•European Factoring Agreement
We also have a factoring agreement in Europe with a financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $201 million and $257 million of accounts receivable through December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of December 31, 2020.
See Note 12 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Guarantor Financial Information
The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US ("Issuer") and are guaranteed by Celanese Corporation ("Parent Guarantor") and the Subsidiary Guarantors (collectively the "Obligor Group"). See Note 12 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors are 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. The Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors represent substantially all of the Company's US assets and business operations. The Subsidiary Guarantors are listed in Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report.
The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors have guaranteed the Senior Notes on a full and unconditional, joint and several, senior unsecured basis. The guarantees are subject to certain customary release provisions, including that a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its respective guarantee in specified circumstances, including (i) the sale or transfer of all of its assets or capital stock; (ii) its merger or consolidation with, or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to, another person; or (iii) its ceasing to be a majority-owned subsidiary of the Issuer in connection with any sale of its capital stock or other transaction. Additionally, a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Senior Notes at such time that it ceases to guarantee the Issuer's obligations under the Credit Agreement (subject to the satisfaction of customary document delivery requirements). The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under their guarantees are limited as necessary to prevent such guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law.
The Parent Guarantor and the Issuer are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries, which own substantially all of our consolidated assets. The Parent Guarantor has no material assets other than the stock of its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, the Issuer. The principal source of cash to pay the Parent Guarantor's and the Issuer's obligations, including obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of the Issuer's obligations under the Credit Agreement, is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and our non-guarantor subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable country or state laws, regulatory limitations and terms of other debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor. While the Credit Agreement and the Indentures generally limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict payment of dividends or other distributions to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, which may have the effect of significantly limiting the applicability of those restrictions.
For cash management purposes, the Company transfers cash between the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors and non-guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries do not guarantee the Issuer's obligations under our outstanding debt, the transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Senior Notes, Credit Agreement, the Company's other outstanding debt, Common Stock dividends and Common Stock repurchases.
The summarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented below on a combined basis after the elimination of: (i) intercompany transactions among such entities and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in the non-guarantor subsidiaries. Transactions with, and amounts due to or from, non-guarantor subsidiaries and affiliates are separately disclosed.
Share Capital
On January 28, 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.68 per share on our Common Stock amounting to $78 million. The cash dividend will be paid on February 23, 2021 to holders of record as of February 9, 2021.
Our Board of Directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of $5.9 billion of our Common Stock since February 2008. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased shares of our Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $650 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion remaining under authorizations by our Board of Directors.
See Note 15 - Stockholders' Equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Contractual Debt and Cash Obligations
The following table sets forth our fixed contractual debt and cash obligations as of December 31, 2020:
______________________________
(1)Future interest expense is calculated using the rate in effect on December 31, 2020.
(2)Other debt is primarily made up of fixed rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, short-term borrowings from affiliated companies and other bank obligations.
(3)Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities, we are unable to determine the timing of payments related to our uncertain tax obligations, including interest and penalties. These amounts are therefore reflected in "After 5 Years".
(4)Unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent the take-or-pay provisions included in certain long-term purchase agreements. We do not expect to incur material losses under these arrangements. These amounts, obtained via a survey of Celanese, also include other purchase obligations such as maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts, software agreements and other miscellaneous agreements and contracts.
Contractual Guarantees and Commitments
As of December 31, 2020, we have standby letters of credit of $21 million and bank guarantees of $23 million outstanding, which are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements.
See Note 12 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the guarantees under our Senior Notes and Credit Agreement.
See Note 21 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings.
