Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues
We have generated no revenues in our cannabis holding company or from our operating subsidiaries, Resonate Blends, LLC or Entourage Labs, LLC, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
We anticipate booking revenue from the Resonate Koan product line in early 2nd quarter of 2021.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses were $1,813,958 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $3,178,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The main reason for our decreased operating expenses in 2020 was a result of non-cash management fees in 2019 of $2,650,518, while this year we only have $198,514 non-cash management fees.
We expect that our operating expenses will increase in 2021 over 2020 as a result of our product launch and the increased expenses associated with operations.
Other Income
We had other expenses of $143,113 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with other expenses of $320,974 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The main reason for our increased other expenses in 2020 was a result of loss on revaluation of derivative liabilities.
Net Income/Loss
We had net loss of $1,941,274 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with net loss of $3,669,728 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had total current assets of $168,924, consisting of $114,325 in cash and $54,599 in advances to suppliers. Our total current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were $1,165,363. We had a working capital deficit of $996,439 as of December 31, 2020, compared with a working capital deficit of $612,330 as of December 31, 2019.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Operating activities used $1,381,003 in cash for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with cash used of $790,897 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our negative operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was largely the result of our net loss of $1,941,274, offset by share based compensation of $508,419. Our negative operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was largely the result of our net loss of $3,510,101, offset mainly by share based compensation of $2,650,518.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We used no cash on investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, but we had $25,000 used in connection with an investment in Joaint in 2019.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $1,492,213 compared with cash flows provided by financing activities of $819,012 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our positive cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock $1,011,113, proceeds from Convertible notes payable $850,100, offset by payments of notes payable of $369,000. Our positive cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants of $811,262 and proceeds from convertible notes of $267,750.
The features of the debt instruments and payables concerning our financing activities are detailed in the footnotes to our financial statements.
Our optimum level of growth for success will be achieved if we are able to raise $1,500,000 in the next twelve months. However, funds are difficult to raise in today’s economic environment. We have experienced a history of losses. If we are unable to raise $1,500,000, our ability to implement our business plan and achieve our goals will be significantly diminished.
We are dependent on investment capital to continue our survival. We have raised money through convertible debt, almost always on unfavorable terms. There is no guarantee that these small convertible loans will be available to us in the future or on terms acceptable to us.
We also plan to raise money in the sale of our equity and debt securities. There can be no assurance of funds from these efforts or that any other type of additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Going Concern
As of December 31, 2020, we have an accumulated deficit of $21,100,995. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While we are expanding our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of our audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
No new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
