ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
Summary Overview
We were formed in December 2014. We had revenues of $1,276,559 in the year ended December 31, 2020 and $748,377 in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Eqova Life Sciences
On October 17, 2017, we acquired Eqova Life Sciences, a Nevada corporation, through an exchange of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for all of the outstanding equity interest of Eqova. As part of the Exchange, we brought on Eqova’s President and Director, Patrick Stiles, to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Director on our Board of Directors. Mr. Stiles resigned in September 2018.
Eqova is a medically-focused CBD company that develops clinical grade full spectrum hemp oil products, sold exclusively via partnerships with licensed medical practitioners to use with their patients. We believed that Eqova provided us with a prime growth opportunity with an established business. Revenues of our hemp oil products from the acquisition of Eqova for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $64,384, but were $0 in 2019. We closed this business in the second quarter of 2019.
BergaMet NA, LLC
On February 4, 2019, we issued and exchanged shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding equity securities of BergaMet. The shares of common stock issued in the Exchange were equal to approximately 80.1% of our outstanding common stock immediately following the exchange.
Through the exchange, we were able to secure funds in BergaMet to pay off some debt and provide capital for operations. We paid an aggregate of $353,908 and were obligated to pay another $164,578 approximately one (1) year later to retire convertible debt. In the third quarter of 2020, we facilitated the sale of the then-outstanding debt to a third-party who converted it into an aggregate of 3,400,000 shares of our common stock. Prior to the exchange, we also entered into agreements with other holders of convertible debt to convert their notes for an aggregate of 806,015 shares of common stock. We also entered into conversion agreements with the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock whereby all of the outstanding preferred stock was converted for an aggregate of 15,592,986 shares of common stock. The conversion and repayment of the preferred stock and convertible debt have greatly improved our capitalization structure, as we now have no outstanding variable-price convertible debt.
The acquisition of BergaMet has been extremely beneficial to us. In addition to paying off our convertible debt, we are now able to better position ourselves in the market. BergaMet is an established company that was already generating revenues when we acquired it. BergaMet also has unique products that will fit nicely with our existing business. We now plan on expanding our product line to other nutraceuticals.
Ultimate Brain Nutrients, LLC
On April 3, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Ultimate Brain Nutrients, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“UBN”), and the members of UBN, whereby we issued and exchanged 90,000,960 shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding equity securities of UBN. UBN is now our wholly-owned subsidiary. The shares of common stock issued in the Exchange were equal to approximately 42.5% of our outstanding common stock immediately following the exchange.
UBN is a science-based company that develops unique, plant-based superior health technology neuro-products that provide natural brain solutions. UBN has numerous proprietary products, with four unique patent-pending formulations and one patent issued.
Financial results for UBN are included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Going Concern
As a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. From inception (December 19, 2014) through the end of December 31, 2020, we have incurred accumulated net losses of $12,956,498. In order to continue as a going concern we must effectively balance many factors and generate more revenue so that we can fund our operations from our sales and revenues. If we are not able to do this we may not be able to continue as an operating company. At our current revenue and burn rate, we have an immediate cash need, and thus we must raise capital by issuing debt or through the sale of our stock. However, there is no assurance that our existing cash flow will be adequate to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and
Introduction

Our cost of revenue exceeded revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 because we built up our inventory of bergamot product.
Revenues and Net Operating Loss
Our revenues, operating expenses, and net operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had negative operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2020 was $59,201. Our monthly cash flow burn rate in 2020 (not including inventory purchases) was approximately $192,000. Although we have strong short term cash needs, as our operating expenses increase we will face strong medium to long term cash needs. We anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through the issuance of debt or the sale of our securities until such time as our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs. With the acquisitions of BergaMet and UBN, we expect to see an increase in revenues over the next few years that will help us maintain the cash we need to operate our business. However, we have incurred additional expenses in these acquisitions and the additional costs to be incurred through this expansion of our operations will increase our need for additional cash flow.
Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:
Our cash decreased by $74,250 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Our total current assets decreased by $750,925, as a result of our decrease in inventory. Our total assets decreased by $334,096 despite our increase in patents/trademarks of $425,877 from the UBN acquisition.
Our current and total liabilities decreased by $4,053,532, from $4,315,136 as of December 31, 2019 to $261,604 as of December 31, 2020. Our total liabilities as of the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of notes payable - related party of $170,866 and accounts payable of $64,836.
In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.
Cash Requirements
Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2020 was $59,201. Our monthly cash flow burn rate in 2020 (not including inventory purchases) was approximately $192,000. Although we have strong short term cash needs, as our operating expenses increase we will face strong medium to long term cash needs. We anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through the sale of our securities until such time as our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operations
Our net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3,482,641 and $3,488,099, respectively, a decrease of $5,458. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a net loss of $2,576,375, plus a change in fair value on derivative liability of $1,053,186 and accrued interest to related party of $490,703. Our net cash used in operating activities for December 31, 2019 consisted primary of net income of $632,776, offset by inventory expense of $(3,080,658) and a change in fair value on derivative liability of $(1,652,931).
Investments
Our cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $(425,877) and $1,813,621, respectively, a decrease of $2,239,498. The decrease in 2020 was primarily from the purchase of UBN.
Financing
Our net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3,834,268 and $1,807,444, respectively, an increase of $2,026,824. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $6,295,811, offset by proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt of $(1,501,876) and proceeds from issuance of notes payable - related party of $(880,000).
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.
Management considers the following policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Our management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. Our management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
