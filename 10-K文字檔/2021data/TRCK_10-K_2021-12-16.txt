Recent Developments
PPP Loan
On May 19, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of $933,200 from a potentially forgivable loan from the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) enacted by Congress under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(36)) (the “CARES Act”) administered by the SBA (the “PPP Loan”). On December 8, 2020, the Company filed the application for forgiveness with BMO Harris Bank National Association (the “Lender”) and on January 8, 2021, the Company received a notification from the Lender that the SBA remitted funds to fully repay the PPP Loan, and that the funds were utilized to pay-off and close the PPP Loan and that the PPP Loan was fully forgiven.
Conrent Facility Agreement
On October 21, 2020, the Company requested, in writing, an additional extension to the maturity date of that certain facility agreement between the Company and Conrent Invest, S.A. (Conrent"), dated December 30, 2013, as amended on February 24, 2019, and further amended on January 7, 2020 (the "Amended Facility Agreement"), which previously provided for a $30.4 million unsecured debt facility. On November 25, 2020, the investors who owned the securities from Conrent used to finance the facility (the "Noteholders") held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024. On December 21, 2020, Conrent and the Company signed an amendment to the Amended Facility Agreement (the "Amended Facility"), which extends the maturity date of the agreement to July 1, 2024, capitalizes the accrued and unpaid interest increasing the outstanding principal amount and reduces the interest rate of the Amended Facility from 8% to 4%. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sapinda Facility Agreement
On September 8, 2020, the Company received a letter from ADS Securities LLC (“ADS”) informing the Company that ADS had been assigned the right to payment under that certain Loan Facility dated September 14, 2015, by and between Sapinda Asia Limited and the Company (the “Sapinda Loan Agreement”). On September 29, 2020, the Company and ADS settled the outstanding amount of approximately $3.4 million due under the Sapinda Loan Agreement for $2.7 million, which was paid on September 30, 2020.
Customer Notifications
On October 15, 2021, the Company received notification from one of its customers implementing requirements regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for contractors pursuant to Executive Order No. 14042 (the “EO”). Pursuant to the EO and guidance of the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, the Company immediately took steps to ensure all “covered contractor employees” could demonstrate proof of vaccination, or an applicable exemption or accommodation, by the deadline of December 8, 2021, which was subsequently amended to January 4, 2022.
Subsequently, on October 27, 2021, the Company received a letter from a second customer also outlining COVID-19 vaccination requirements pursuant to a local county mandate, which further applies to contractors who work onsite at county facilities. The Company has taken steps to ensure that it is in compliance with this specific county mandate.
Results of Operations
Continuing Operations - Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Revenue
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we had revenue of $39,661,325 compared to revenue of $33,875,167 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $5,786,158, or approximately 17%. Of this revenue, $39,179,699 and $33,217,661 were from monitoring and other related services revenue during the 2021 and 2020 fiscal years, respectively, representing an increase of $5,962,038 or approximately 18%. Growth in monitoring and other related services during the year ended September 30, 2021 was principally the result of an increase in total growth of our North American monitoring operations driven by clients in Illinois, Michigan, Puerto Rico and Bahamas, partially offset by our Chilean operation. The decrease in revenue in Chile can be attributed to the strengthening U.S. dollar and the decline in devices due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 which closed or delayed the Chilean court system, when compared to the same period in 2020.
Product and other revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021 decreased to $481,626 from $657,506 in the same period in 2020 largely due to lower product sales of $126,348 and lower sales of other non-monitoring revenue items. The decrease in product sales was due to lower international product sales, principally in Mexico. We continue to largely focus on recurring subscription-based opportunities as opposed to equipment sales.
Cost of Revenue
During the year ended September 30, 2021, cost of revenue totaled $18,554,011 compared to cost of revenue during the year ended September 30, 2020 of $15,229,464, an increase of $3,324,547, or approximately 22%. The increase in cost of revenue was largely the result of higher monitoring costs of $1,997,217, higher commission costs of $554,759, higher software amortization of $413,114, higher server costs of $405,524 and higher freight costs of $283,113. These increases were offset by lower lost, stolen and damaged device costs of $179,354, lower device repair costs of $133,763, lower communication costs of $89,531 and lower product cost of sales of $76,300.
Depreciation and amortization included in cost of revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, totaled $2,402,367 and $1,923,356, respectively. The increase of $479,011, or approximately 25%, largely represents software amortization of our new monitoring platform software which began in July 2021 and an increase in depreciation of devices of $65,898. Amortization of a patent related to GPS and satellite tracking are also included in depreciation and amortization. Devices are depreciated over either a three- or five-year useful life. Monitoring software is amortized over a seven-year life. Royalty agreements are being amortized over a ten-year useful life. The Company believes these lives are appropriate due to changes in electronic monitoring technology and the corresponding potential for obsolescence. Management periodically assesses the useful life of the devices for appropriateness.
Gross Profit and Margin
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, gross profit totaled $21,107,314, resulting in a 53% gross margin, compared to $18,645,703, or a 55% gross margin, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $2,461,611. The increase in absolute gross profit of $2,461,611 was due to an increase in revenue of $5,786,158, partially offset by increases in certain costs of revenue, including monitoring costs, commissions, depreciation and amortization, server costs and freight costs. The decrease in the gross profit margin of 2% was largely due to amortization of newly developed software and amortization of monitoring center costs associated with a new contract of an international customer.
General and Administrative Expense
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our general and administrative expense totaled $10,232,116, compared to $10,381,859 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease of $149,743, or approximately 1%, in general and administrative cost resulted largely from lower bad debt expense of $109,599, lower consulting and outside service costs of $55,651, lower legal and professional fees of $37,926, lower travel and entertainment expense of $35,157 and lower bank charges and fees of $27,785. These savings were partially offset by higher insurance costs of $125,313.
Selling and Marketing Expense
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our selling and marketing expense was $2,716,283 compared to $2,257,667 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase of $458,616 or approximately 20% resulted largely from higher wages and related payroll taxes of $263,642 and higher outside services and consulting costs of $185,044.
Research and Development Expense
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we incurred research and development expense of $1,548,527 compared to those costs recognized during fiscal year 2020 totaling $1,182,542, an increase of $365,985 or approximately 31%. The increase resulted largely from higher payroll and related payroll taxes of $363,537. As of July 1, 2021, the Company completed its new technology platform to improve the efficiency of its software, firmware, user interface, and automation. As a result of these improvements, $1,349,550 was capitalized as developed technology during the year ended September 30, 2021, and $1,514,482 was capitalized during the year ended September 30, 2020. A portion of this expense would have been recognized as research and development expense, absent the significant enhancements to the technology.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
We maintain a significant portion of our tangible and intangible assets that are amortized or depreciated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, depreciation and amortization included in operating expense totaled $1,896,481, compared to $2,064,097 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This was a decrease of $167,616, or approximately 8%, largely related to the full amortization of certain assets.
Other Income (Expense)
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, other income (expense) totaled ($554,392) compared to an expense of ($2,084,982) during fiscal 2020. The decrease of $1,530,590 in net other expense resulted primarily from income from extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2021 of $1,000,756, compared to income from extinguishment of debt of $699,644 related to the settlement of a note payable at a discount in fiscal 2020, positive exchange rate movement of $931,691 and lower interest expense of $311,434. The lower interest expense was primarily due to the restructuring of the Conrent Amended Facility. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September 8, 2020, the Company received a letter from ADS informing the Company that ADS had been assigned the right to payment under that certain Loan Facility dated September 14, 2015, by and between Sapinda Asia Limited and the Company (the “Sapinda Loan Agreement”). On September 30, 2020, the Company and ADS settled the outstanding amount due under the Sapinda Loan Agreement for $2.7 million. The Company recorded a gain of $699,644 which is included in other income/expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.
Income taxes
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, income tax expense totaled $717,109 compared to $793,197 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Tax expense in both fiscal years are income taxes largely related to a foreign jurisdiction.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders
We had net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 totaling $3,442,406 or $0.30 and $0.29 per basic and diluted common share, respectively, compared to a net loss of ($118,641), or ($0.01) per common share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This improvement is largely due to higher gross profit, lower general and administrative expense, lower depreciation and amortization, lower other income (expense) and lower tax expense, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expense and higher research and development expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company is currently self-funded through net cash provided by operating activities and was able to utilize cash from operations to fulfill its obligation under the Sapinda Loan Agreement of $3.4 million at the end of September 2020, which was discounted to a cash payment of $2.7 million made on September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, excluding interest, approximately $42.9 million is still owed to Conrent under the Amended Facility.
On May 19, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of $933,200 from the PPP Loan received pursuant to the PPP enacted by Congress under the CARES Act, administered by the SBA. On December 8, 2020, the Company filed the application for forgiveness with the Lender and on January 8, 2021, the Company received a notification from the Lender that the SBA remitted funds to fully repay the PPP Loan, and that the funds were utilized to pay-off and close the PPP Loan and that the PPP Loan was fully forgiven.
On October 21, 2020, the Company requested, in writing, an additional extension to the maturity date of the $30.4 million Amended Facility Agreement. On November 25, 2020, the Noteholders held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024. On December 21, 2020, Conrent and the Company signed the Amended Facility, which extends the maturity date of the Amended Facility Agreement to July 1, 2024, capitalizes the accrued and unpaid interest increasing the outstanding principal amount and reduces the interest rate of the Amended Facility from 8% to 4%. On March 1, 2021, Conrent completed their documentation and the updated registration process to implement these changes and the Company transferred $12,531,556 of accrued interest to the note payable for total principal of $42,931,556. Conrent forgave $67,556 of the amount due and the new Amended Facility principal and interest became $42,864,000. Interest payments are scheduled to be made on June 30 and December 31 each year, which began on June 30, 2021. We began amortizing deferred financing fees of approximately $360,000 on July 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, $42,864,000 of principal and $438,165 of interest was owed to Conrent.
On January 6, 2021, the Company borrowed 70,443,375 Chilean Pesos (“CLP”) ($101,186 USD) from HP Financial Services Chile Limitada. To facilitate the Loan, the Company entered into a Note Payable Agreement with HP Financial Services Chile Limitada as lender. The loan was used to purchase PABX (private automatic branch exchange phone equipment) for the construction of the Gendarmeria de Chile monitoring centers in Santiago and Puerto Montt, Chile. The loan bears an interest rate of 6.56% per annum, payable monthly with principal beginning February 2021, and a maturity date of February 6, 2024.
On January 12, 2021, the Company borrowed 347,198,500CLP ($482,965 USD), net of 2,801,500CLP fees ($3,897 USD), from Banco Santander. To facilitate the Loan, the Company entered into a Note Payable Agreement with Banco Santander as lender. The loan was used to comply with the construction of Gendarmeria de Chile monitoring center in Santiago, Chile and remodeling a temporary monitoring center. The loan bears an interest at a rate of 5.04% per annum, payable monthly with principal beginning February 2021, and a maturity of May 11, 2024. The Company also paid 19,607,843CLP ($27,275USD) in broker fees which are amortized over the life of the loan.
On February 2, 2021, the Company borrowed 247,999,300CLP ($338,954 USD), net of 2,000,700CLP fees ($2,734USD), from Banco Estado. To facilitate the Loan, the Company entered into a Note Payable Agreement with Banco Estado as lender. The loan provided was used for the construction of the Gendarmeria de Chile monitoring center in Santiago city and computer equipment for Gendarmeria branch offices. The loan bears an interest rate of 3.50% per annum, initially having a 6-month grace period with the first payment including the 6 months of interest plus 1 month of principal on August 2, 2021, then monthly interest with principal, and a maturity date of January 2, 2024. The Company also paid 14,124,294CLP ($19,304 USD) in broker fees which are amortized over the life of the loan.
On February 4, 2021, the Company borrowed 149,794,432CLP ($205,330 USD) from HP Financial Services Chile Limitada. To facilitate the Loan, the Company entered into a Note Payable Agreement with HP Financial Services Chile Limitada as lender.

The loan bears an interest at a rate of 3.12% per annum, payable monthly with principal beginning March 2021, and a maturity of February 17, 2025. The Company also paid 28,248,588CLP ($38,317 USD) in broker fees which are amortized over the life of the loan.
Management will continue to seek other sources of capital, refinancing options, prepayment of debt at a discount and potentially other transactions including the exchange of some debt for an equity related security to reduce its total debt and assist in meeting all of its future obligations. While management believes it will be successful in completing one of these alternatives prior to the maturity of the Amended Facility Agreement in July 2024, no assurances can be given.
Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we had net income of $3,442,406 and we had cash flows from operating activities of $4,822,182, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $118,641 and cash flows from operating activities of $4,725,864 for fiscal year 2020. The increase of cash from operations in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was largely the result of a decline in accounts payable and an improvement in operating performance, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in prepaid expense, deposits and other assets.
Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities.
The Company used $4,507,696 of cash for investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to $2,942,195 of cash used during fiscal year 2020, an increase of $1,565,501. Cash used for investing activities was used for significant enhancements of our software platform and for purchases of monitoring and other equipment to meet customer demand during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Purchases of monitoring equipment increased $1,670,912 compared to the prior period, largely due to the purchase of new monitoring devices to replace 3G monitoring devices transitioning out of service in the U.S. in the first quarter of calendar 2022.
Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities.
$1,377,224 of cash was provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to $1,794,357 of cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2020. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of $1,943,213 and $933,200 from borrowings, respectively and made principal payments of $275,628 and $2,727,557 on notes payable, respectively. The net proceeds of $933,200 received in the year ended September 30, 2020 were from a potentially forgivable loan from the SBA and the loan was forgiven in January 2021. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Liquidity, Working Capital and Management’s Plan
As of September 30, 2021, the Company had unrestricted cash of $8,421,162, compared to unrestricted cash of $6,762,099 as of September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, we had a working capital of $9,190,430, compared to a working capital deficit of $34,773,161 as of September 30, 2020. This increase in working capital of $43,963,591 is principally due to the 3-year extension of the Conrent loan of $30,400,000 and the capitalization of interest to increase the loan balance to $42,864,000, which is now due July 1, 2024.
On May 19, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of $933,200 from the SBA pursuant to the PPP enacted by Congress under the CARES Act which was subsequently forgiven in full. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On October 21, 2020, the Company requested, in writing, an additional extension to the maturity date of the Amended Facility Agreement. On November 25, 2020, the Noteholders held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024. On December 21, 2020, Conrent and the Company signed an Amendment to the Amended Facility Agreement which extends the maturity date of the agreement to July 1, 2024, capitalizes the accrued and unpaid interest increasing the outstanding principal amount and reduces the interest rate of the Amended Facility Agreement from 8% to 4%. On June 28, 2021, the Company restarted interest payments to Conrent which will be made semi-annually going forward. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company borrowed approximately $2.0 million though six notes payable to fund the construction of monitoring centers in Chile required by our new contract. These six notes mature between January 2024 to February 2025 and the principal repayments on these six notes have all commenced. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability; however, the rise in inflation recently is impacting the Company’s cost of labor and materials.
Off-Balance Sheet Financial Arrangements
The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company, except as described below.
Bond guarantees
As of September 30, 2021, Company has two performance bonds in connection with a foreign customer totaling $2,294,936, (“Performance Bonds”) of which $1,606,424 is held in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the customer and is recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining amount of $688,512 is guaranteed by a foreign financial institution on behalf of the Company. The amounts held on the two Performance Bonds will be released approximately 90 days after the expiration of the Performance Bonds, as follows: $300,014 on January 18, 2022 and $1,306,410 on July 2, 2024. In March 2021, the Company has placed a $653,220 deposit into an interest-bearing account with a financial institution to replace the performance bond expiring on July 2, 2024, whereby the portion guaranteed by the financial institution will increase from 30% to 65% of the total bond. The current bond expiring July 2, 2024 will be released following completion of the transaction. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
In Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, we discuss those accounting policies we consider to be significant in determining the results of operations and our financial position.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, product liability, revenue, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other facts and circumstances that are believed to be reasonable, and the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
With respect to revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, leases, stock-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, we apply critical accounting policies discussed below in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is predominantly derived from two sources: (i) monitoring services, and (ii) product sales.
Monitoring and Other Related Services
Monitoring services include two components: (i) lease contracts pursuant to which the Company provides monitoring services and lease devices to distributors or end users and the Company retains ownership of the leased device; and (ii) monitoring services purchased by distributors or end users who have previously purchased monitoring devices and opt to use the Company’s monitoring services. Sales of devices and/or leased GPS devices are required to use the Company’s monitoring service and both the GPS leased devices and monitoring services are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Monitoring revenue is recognized ratably over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services as they are performed. Payment due or received from the customers prior to rendering the associated services are recorded as deferred revenue.
Product Sales and Other
The Company sells devices and replacement parts to customers under certain contracts, as well as law enforcement software licenses and maintenance, and analytical software. Revenue from the sale of devices and parts is recognized upon their transfer of control to the customer, which is generally upon delivery. Delivery is considered complete at either the time of shipment or arrival at destination, based on the agreed upon terms within the contract. Payment terms are generally 30 days from invoice date. When purchasing products (such as ReliAlert™ and Shadow™ devices) from the Company, customers may, but are not required to, enter into monitoring service contracts with us. The Company recognizes revenue on monitoring services for customers that have previously purchased devices at the end of each month that monitoring services have been provided.
Multiple Element Arrangements
The majority of our revenue transactions do not have multiple elements. However, on occasion, the Company may enter into revenue transactions that have multiple elements. These may include different combinations of products or services that are included in a single billable rate. These products or services are delivered over time as the customer utilizes our services. In cases where obligations in a contract are distinct and thus require separation into multiple performance obligations, revenue recognition guidance requires that contract consideration be allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The value allocated to each performance obligation is then recognized as revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct promise or bundle of promises has been met.
Other Matters
The Company considers an arrangement with payment terms longer than the Company’s normal terms not to be fixed or determinable. Normal payment terms for the sale of monitoring services and products are due upon receipt to 30 days. The Company sells devices and services directly to end users and to distributors. Distributors do not have general rights of return. Also, distributors may not have price protection or stock protection rights with respect to devices sold to them by us. Generally, title and risk of loss pass to the buyer upon delivery of the devices.
The Company estimates product returns based on historical experience and maintains an allowance for estimated returns, which is recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable and revenue.
Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are included as part of total revenue. The related freight costs and supplies directly associated with shipping products to customers are included as a component of cost of revenue. Our revenue is predominantly derived from two sources: (i) monitoring services, and (ii) product sales.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
We review our long-lived assets including goodwill and intangibles for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable, and in the case of goodwill, at least annually. We evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment as of each balance sheet date. We use an equity method of the related asset or group of assets in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its market value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are an identifiable fair market value that is independent of other groups of assets.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable. In doing so, we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In February 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. For lessees, the amendments in this update require that for all leases not considered to be short term, a company recognize both a lease liability and right-of-use asset on its balance sheet, representing the obligation to make payments and the right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019. See Note 12 for the impact the adoption had on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on their grant date fair value. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires us to make estimates for certain assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, expected life of options, expected volatility of stock, and expected dividend yield of stock.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations.
