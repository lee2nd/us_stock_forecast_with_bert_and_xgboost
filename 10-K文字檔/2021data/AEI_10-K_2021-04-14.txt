Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Business Overview
We are a diversified holding company principally engaged through our subsidiaries in property development, digital transformation technology and biohealth activities with operations in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea. We manage our three principal businesses primarily through our 60.2% owned subsidiary, Alset International Limited, a public company traded on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Through this subsidiary (and indirectly, through other public and private U.S. and Asian subsidiaries), we are actively developing two significant real estate projects near Houston, Texas and in Frederick, Maryland in our property development segment. We have designed applications for enterprise messaging and e-commerce software platforms in the United States and Asia in our digital transformation technology business unit. Our recent foray into the biohealth segment includes research to treat neurological and immune-related diseases, nutritional chemistry to create a natural sugar alternative, research regarding innovative products to slow the spread of disease, and natural foods and supplements.
We opportunistically identify global businesses for acquisition, incubation and corporate advisory services, primarily related to our existing operating business segments. We also have ownership interests outside of Alset International, including an indirect 16.8% equity interest in Holista CollTech Limited, a public Australian company that produces natural food ingredients, and an indirect 13.1% equity interest in Vivacitas Oncology Inc., a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company, but neither of which company has material asset value relative to our principal businesses. Under the guidance of Chan Heng Fai, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is also our largest stockholder, we have positioned ourselves as a participant in these key markets through a series of strategic transactions. Our growth strategy is both to pursue acquisition opportunities that we can leverage on our global network using our capital and management resources and to accelerate the expansion of our organic businesses.
We generally acquire majority and/or control stakes in innovative and promising businesses that are expected to appreciate in value over time. Our emphasis is on building businesses in industries where our management team has in-depth knowledge and experience, or where our management can provide value by advising on new markets and expansion. We have at times provided a range of global capital and management services to these companies in order to gain access to Asian markets. We have historically favored businesses that improve an individual’s quality of life or that improve the efficiency of businesses through technology in various industries. We believe our capital and management services provide us with a competitive advantage in the selection of strategic acquisitions, which creates and adds value for our company and our stockholders.
Our Revenue Model
Our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $16,238,200 and $24,257,953, respectively. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $4,398,435 and $8,053,428, respectively.
We currently recognize revenue from the sale of our subdivision development properties and the sale of our biohealth products. Sales of real properties accounted for approximately 84% and sales of biohealth products accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales of properties accounted for approximately 94% and sales of biohealth products accounted for approximately 6% of our total revenue in 2019.
From a geographical perspective, we recognized 84% and 100% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the United States. 16% of our revenue in 2020 was recognized from our sales in South Korea.
We believe that, on an ongoing basis, revenue generated from our property development business will decline as a percentage of our total revenue as we expect to experience greater revenue contribution from our digital transformation technology, biohealth businesses and future business acquisitions.
Financial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Real Estate Projects
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic’s far-reaching impact on the global economy could negatively affect various aspects of our business, including demand for real estate. From March through December 2020, we continued to sell lots at our Ballenger Run project (in Maryland) for the construction of town homes to NVR. Sales of such homes by NVR were at the same level in 2020 as in the 2019. In 2020 we sold 121 lots to NVR and in 2019, 123 lots. Such town homes are often a first home that generally did not require buyers to sell an existing home. We believe low interest rates have encouraged home sales. Many buyers opted to see home models at the project virtually. This technology allowed them to ask questions to sales staff and see the town homes. Home closings were able to occur electronically.
We have received strong indications that buyers and renters across the country are expressing interest in moving from more densely populated urban areas to the suburbs. We believe that our Ballenger Run project is well suited and positioned to accommodate those buyers. Our latest phase for sale at Ballenger Run, involving single-family homes, has seen a high number of interested potential buyers signing up for additional information and updates on home availability.
The COVID-19 pandemic could impact the ability of our staff and contractors to continue to work, and our ability to conduct our operations in a prompt and efficient manner. To date, we experienced a slowdown in the construction of a clubhouse at the Ballenger Run project, which was completed behind schedule. We believe this delay was caused in part by policies requiring lower numbers of contractors working in indoor spaces.
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the timeliness of local government in granting required approvals. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause the completion of important stages in our real estate projects to be delayed.
At our Black Oak project in Texas, we have strategically redesigned the lots over the past year for a smaller “starter home” products that we believe will be more resilient in fluctuating markets. Should we initiate sales at Black Oak, we believe the same implications described above, regarding our Ballenger Run project, may apply to our Black Oak project (including the general trend of customers’ interest shifting from urban to suburban areas). Unlike our Ballenger Run project, our Black Oak project may include our involvement in single family rental home development.
On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a term note with M&T Bank with a principal amount of $68,502 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Term Note”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The PPP Loan is evidenced by a promissory note. The PPP Term Note bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.00%, with the first ten months of principal and interest deferred. On November 26, 2020, $64,502 of this loan was forgiven by the United States Small Business Administration and $64,502 was recorded as other income. The remaining balance of $4,000 was paid back in December 2020.
On February 11, 2021, the Company entered into a term note with M&T Bank with a principal amount of $68,502 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Term Note”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The PPP Loan is evidenced by a promissory note. The PPP Term Note bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.00%, with the first sixteen months of principal and interest deferred or until we apply for the loan forgiveness. The PPP Term Note may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
On June 18, 2020, Alset EHome Inc. (formerly known as SeD Home Inc., SeD Home & REITs Inc. and then Alset iHome Inc.) entered into a Loan Agreement with M&T Bank. Pursuant to this Loan Agreement, M&T Bank provided a non-revolving loan to Alset EHome Inc. in an aggregate amount of up to $2,990,000, as described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. It is intended that this loan will be utilized to commence our residential initiatives.
Our subsidiaries are reviewing plans for potential additional fundraising to fund single family rental operations and the acquisition of additional real estate projects.
Other Business Activities
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our potential to expand our business activities in ways that are difficult to assess or predict. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the global supply of certain goods and services in ways that may impact the sale of products to consumers that we, or companies we may invest in or partner with, will attempt to make. The COVID-19 pandemic may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive opportunities.
Impact on Staff
Most of our U.S. staff works out of our Bethesda, Maryland office. At our office in Texas, we received a 50% rent abatement for the month of May 2020.
Our U.S. staff has shifted to mostly working from home since March 2020, but this has had a minimal impact on our operations to date. Our staff in Singapore and Hong Kong has been able to work from home when needed with minimal impact on our operations, however our staff’s ability to travel between our Hong Kong and Singapore offices has been significantly limited, and our staff’s travel between the U.S. and non-U.S. offices has been suspended since March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the frequency with which our management would otherwise travel to the Black Oaks project; however, we have a contractor in Texas providing supervision of the project. Management continues to regularly supervise the Ballenger Run project. Limitations on the mobility of our management and staff may slow down our ability to enter into new transactions and expand existing projects.
We have not reduced our staff in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, we did not have to expend significant resources related to employee health and safety matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have a small staff, however, and the inability of any significant number of our staff to work due to illness or the illness of a family member could adversely impact our operations.
Matters that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business
In addition to the matters described above, the primary challenges and trends that could affect or are affecting our financial results include:
●
Our ability to improve our revenue through cross-selling and revenue-sharing arrangements among our diverse group of companies;
●
Our ability to identify complementary businesses for acquisition, obtain additional financing for these acquisitions, if and when needed, and profitably integrate them into our existing operation;
●
Our ability to attract competent, skilled technical and sales personnel for each of our businesses at acceptable compensation levels to manage our overhead; and
●
Our ability to control our operating expenses as we expand each of our businesses and product and service offerings.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Common Control Transactions resulted in the following basis of accounting for the financial reporting periods: The acquisitions of Heng Fai Enterprises Pte. Ltd. and Global eHealth Limited were accounted for prospectively as of October 1, 2018 and they did not represent a change in reporting entity.
ASC 805-50-45 defines the transfer of a business among entities under common control at carrying amount with retrospective adjustment of prior period financial statements when reporting entity is changed. ASC 250 defines a change in the reporting entity as a change that results in financial statements that, in effect, are those of a different reporting entity. Our management believed that the acquisitions of Hengfai International Pte. Ltd. and LiquidValue Asset Management Pte. Ltd. led to change in the reporting entities and the acquisitions of Heng Fai Enterprises Pte. Ltd. and Global eHealth Limited did not.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns more than 50% of the voting common stock and controls operations. All intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability and useful lives of property, plant and equipment, valuation of real estate assets, allocation of development costs and capitalized interest to sold lots, the valuation allowance of deferred taxes, contingencies and equity compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition and Cost of Sales
The following represents a disaggregation of our revenue recognition policies by segment:
Property Development
● Property Sales. The Company's main business is land development. The Company purchases land and develops it into residential communities. The developed lots are sold to builders (customers) for the construction of new homes. The builders enter into a sales contract with the Company before they take the lots. The prices and timeline are determined and agreed upon in the contract. The builders do the inspections to make sure all conditions and requirements in contracts are met before purchasing the lots. A detailed breakdown of the five-step process for the revenue recognition of the Ballenger and Black Oak projects, which represented approximately 84% and 94% of the Company’s revenue in the years ended on December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is as follows:
Identify the contract with a customer. The Company has signed agreements with the builders for developing the raw land to ready to build lots. The contract has agreed upon prices, timelines, and specifications for what is to be provided.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations of the Company include delivering developed lots to the customer, which are required to meet certain specifications that are outlined in the contract. The customer inspects all lots prior to accepting title to ensure all specifications are met.
Determine the transaction price. The transaction price per lot is fixed and specified in the contract. Any subsequent change orders or price changes are required to be approved by both parties.
Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. Each lot is considered to be a separate performance obligation, for which the specified price in the contract is allocated to.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies performance obligation. The builders do the inspections to make sure all conditions/requirements are met before taking title of lots. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when title is transferred. The Company does not have further performance obligations or continuing involvement once title is transferred.
● Sale of the Front Foot Benefit Assessments. We have established a front foot benefit (“FFB”) assessment on all of the lots sold to NVR. This is a 30-year annual assessment allowed in Frederick County which requires homeowners to reimburse the developer for the costs of installing public water and sewer to the lots. These assessments become effective as homes are settled, at which time we can sell the collection rights to investors who will pay an upfront lump sum, enabling us to more quickly realize the revenue. The selling prices range from $3,000 to $4,500 per home depending on the type of home. Our total expected revenue from the front foot benefit assessment is approximately $1 million. To recognize revenue of the FFB assessment, both our and NVR’s performance obligations have to be satisfied. Our performance obligation is completed once we complete the construction of water and sewer facilities and close the lot sales with NVR, which inspects these water and sewer facilities prior to the close of lot sales to ensure all specifications are met. NVR’s performance obligation is to sell homes they build to homeowners. Our FFB revenue is recognized upon NVR’s sales of homes to homeowners. The agreement with these FFB investors is not subject to amendment by regulatory agencies and thus our revenue from FFB assessment is not either. During the years ended December, 2020 and 2019, we recognized revenue in the amounts of $273,620 and $548,457 from FFB assessments, respectively.
● Cost of Sales. Land acquisition costs are allocated to each lot based on the area method, the size of the lot comparing to the total size of all lots in the project. Development costs and capitalized interest are allocated to lots sold based on the total expected development and interest costs of the completed project and allocating a percentage of those costs based on the selling price of the sold lot compared to the expected sales values of all lots in the project.
If the allocation of development costs and capitalized interest based on the projection and relative expected sales value is impracticable, those costs could also be allocated based on an area method, which uses the size of the lots compared to the total project area and allocates costs based on their size.
Digital Transformation Technology
● Software Development Income. Revenue is recognized when (or as) the Company transfers promised goods or services to its customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, which occurs when (or as) the Company satisfies its contractual obligations and transfers over control of the promised goods or services to its customers. We generate revenue from a project involving provision of services and web/software development for customers. In respect to the provision of services, the agreements are less than one year with a cancellation clause and customers are typically billed on a monthly basis.
Biohealth
● Product Direct Sales. The Company’s net sales consist of product sales. The Company's performance obligation is to transfer its products to its third-party independent distributors (“Distributors”). The Company generally recognizes revenue when product is shipped to its Distributors.
The Company’s Distributors may receive distributor allowances, which are comprised of discounts, rebates and wholesale commission payments from the Company. Distributor allowances resulting from the Company’s sales of its products to its Distributors are recorded against net sales because the distributor allowances represent discounts from the suggested retail price.
In addition to distributor allowances, the Company compensates its sales leader Distributors with leadership incentives for services rendered, relating to the development, retention, and management of their sales organizations. Leadership Incentives are payable based on achieved sales volume, which are recorded in general and administrative expenses. The Company recognizes revenue when it ships products. The Company receives the net sales price in cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale.
If a Distributor returns a product to the Company on a timely basis, they may obtain a replacement product from the Company for such returned product. In addition, the Company maintains a buyback program pursuant to which it will repurchase products sold to a Distributor who has decided to leave the business. Allowances for product returns, primarily in connection with the Company’s buyback program, are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This accrual is based upon historical return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern, which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to 12 months following the original sale.
● Annual Membership. The Company collects an annual membership fee from its Distributors. The fee is fixed, paid in full at the time of joining the membership and not refundable. The Company’s performance obligation is to provide members to purchase products, access to certain back office services, receive commissions and attend corporate events. The obligation is satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the membership over the one-year period of the membership. Before the membership fee is recognized as revenue, it is recorded as deferred revenue.
Real Estate Assets
Real estate assets are recorded at cost, except when acquired real estate assets meet the definition of a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” which are recorded at fair value. Interest, property taxes, insurance and other incremental costs (including salaries) directly related to a project are capitalized during the construction period of major facilities and land improvements. The capitalization period begins when activities to develop the parcel commence and ends when the asset constructed is completed. The capitalized costs are recorded as part of the asset to which they relate and are reduced when lots are sold.
We capitalized interest from the third-party borrowings of $0 and $526,297 and capitalized construction costs of approximately $10.3 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
On December 31, 2019, total real estate property under development was $23.9 million, including:
●
land held for development in the amount of $14.3 million (consisting of $6.9 million for Black Oak, $6.9 million for Ballenger Run and $0.5 million for our Perth project);
●
capitalized development costs in the amount of $5.7 million (consisting of $0.3 million for Black Oak and $5.4 million for Ballenger Run); and
●
capitalized finance costs were $3.9 million.
On December 31, 2020, total real estate property under development was $20.5 million, including:
●
land held for development in the amount of $10.9 million (consisting of $6.9 million for Black Oak, $3.5 million for Ballenger Run and $0.5 million for our Perth project);
●
capitalized development costs in the amount of $6.1 million (consisting of $1.2 million for Black Oak, $4.8 million for Ballenger Run and $0.1 million for our Perth project); and
●
capitalized finance costs were $3.5 million.
On June 30, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $3.9 million of impairment on the Black Oak project.
On December 31, 2019, Black Oak recognized additional real estate impairment of approximately $1.3 million.
On December 31, 2020, the capitalized construction costs were as follows:
On December 31, 2019, the capitalized construction costs were as follows:
Through December 31, 2020, there were no sales from the Perth project. In addition, no sales agreement had been signed for this project.
Results of Operations
Summary of Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue
The following table sets forth period-over-period changes in revenues for each of our reporting segments:
Revenue was $16,238,200 and $24,257,953 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An increase in property sales from the Ballenger Project and first sale of a section of Black Oak Project in the first quarter of 2019 contributed to higher revenue in that period. Pursuant to a lot purchase agreement dated July 3, 2018, 150 CCM Black Oak Ltd sold 124 lots located in the Company’s Black Oak project to Houston LD, LLC for a total purchase price of $6,175,000 in January 2019. As for our Ballenger Project, builders are required to purchase a minimum number of lots based on their applicable sale agreements. We collect revenue only from the sale of lots to builders. We are not involved in the construction of homes at the present time. The revenue from the sale of lots in our Ballenger project was similar in both 2019 and 2020.
Income from the sale of Front Foot Benefits (“FFBs”), assessed on Ballenger Run project lots, decreased from $548,457 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $273,620 in year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is a mixed result of the decreased sale of properties to homebuyers in 2020 and sale of FFBs of a smaller value.
Revenues from our biohealth segment in 2019 come from the direct sales by iGalen Inc. (formerly known as iGalen USA, LLC), which is 100% owned by iGalen International Inc., Alset International’s 53%-owned subsidiary. On December 30, 2020 Alset International’s ownership of iGalen International was sold to one of the directors of iGalen International. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the revenue from iGalen Inc. was $89,567 and $1,371,298, respectively.
In October 2019, the Company expanded its biohealth segment to Korean market through one of the subsidiaries of Health Wealth Happiness Pte. Ltd., HWH World Inc (“HWH World”). HWH World, similarly to iGalen Inc., operates based on a direct sale model of health supplements. HWH World recognized $2,504,944 in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. No revenue was recognized in the year ended on December 31, 2019.
The category described as “Other” includes corporate and financial services and new venture businesses. "Other" includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments, primarily consisting of unallocated corporate overhead costs, including administrative functions not allocated to the reportable segments from global functional expenses.
The financial services and new venture businesses are small and diversified, and accordingly they are not separately addressed as one independent category. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the revenue from other businesses was $0 and $31,209, respectively, generated by fund management services.
Operating Expenses
The following table sets forth period-over-period changes in cost of sales for each of our reporting segments:
Cost of sales decreased from $19,968,757 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $12,085,574 in the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the decrease in sales in the Ballenger Run and Black Oak projects. Capitalized construction expenses, finance costs and land costs are allocated to sales. We anticipate the total cost of sales to increase as revenue increases.
The gross margin decreased from $4,289,196 to $4,152,626 in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of gross margin was caused by the decrease of gross margin of Ballenger Run project, mostly due to the decrease in the sales. The gross margin from sale of Black Oak section one lots was approximately $0 after real estate impairment of $1.5 million was recorded in 2018.
The following table sets forth period-over-period changes in operating expenses for each of our reporting segments.
The decrease of operating expenses of property development in 2020 compared with 2019 was mostly caused by the recognition of $5.2 million impairment in 2019. The decrease of research and development expense in biohealth segment was the main reason of decrease of operating expenses in biohealth segment in 2020 compared with 2019. The increase expense in other segment was mostly due to the issuance of Alset International’s stock for performance award program at the expense of $1,417,523 in second quarter of 2020.
Other Income (Expense)
In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had other expense of $2,282,013 compared to other expense of $17,527 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The change from unrealized gain (loss) on securities investment explained the volatility in these two periods. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the unrealized loss on securities investment was $1,750,454 comparing to unrealized gain on security investment of $320,032 in the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, loss on investment in security by equity method at December 31, 2020 was $227,643, compared to $0 loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Discontinued Operations
On October 25, 2018, HotApps International Pte. Ltd. (“HIP”) entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with DSS Asia Limited (“DSS Asia”), a Hong Kong subsidiary of DSS International Inc. (“DSS International”), pursuant to which HIP agreed to sell to DSS Asia all of the issued and outstanding shares of HotApps Information Technology Co. Ltd., also known as Guangzhou HotApps Technology Ltd. (“Guangzhou HotApps”). Guangzhou HotApps was a wholly owned subsidiary of HIP, which was primarily engaged in engineering work for software development, mainly voice over internet protocol. Guangzhou HotApps was also involved in a number of outsourcing projects, including projects related to real estate and lighting.
The parties to the Equity Purchase Agreement agreed that the purchase price for this transaction would be $100,000, which would be paid in the form of a two-year, interest free, unsecured, demand promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000, and that such note would be due and payable in full in two years. In 2020, this promissory note was fully paid. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the outstanding receivable of this promissory note was $0 and $100,000, respectively. The closing of the Equity Purchase Agreement was subject to certain conditions; these conditions were met and the transaction closed on January 14, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, no income or loss from this discontinued operation was recognized. During the year ended on December 31, 2019, the discontinued loss was $3,712.
On April 27, 2020, Global BioMedical Pte Ltd (“GBM”), one of our subsidiaries, entered into a share exchange agreement with DSS BioHealth Security, Inc. (“DBHS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Document Securities Systems Inc. (“DSS”), pursuant to which, DBHS agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Impact BioMedical Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of GBM, through a share exchange. It was agreed that the aggregate consideration to be issued to GBM for the Impact BioMedical shares would be the following: (i) 483,334 newly issued shares of DSS common stock; and (ii) 46,868 newly issued shares of a new series of DSS perpetual convertible preferred stock with a stated value of $46,868,000 ($1,000 per share). The convertible preferred stock will be convertible into shares of DSS common stock at a conversion price of $6.48 of preferred stock stated value per share of common stock, subject to a 19.9% beneficial ownership conversion limitation (a so-called “blocker”) based on the total issued outstanding shares of common stock of DSS beneficially owned by GBM. Holders of the convertible preferred stock will have no voting rights, except as required by applicable law or regulation, and no dividends will accrue or be payable on the convertible preferred stock. The holders of convertible preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and DSS will have the right to redeem all or any portion of the then outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, pro rata among all holders, at a redemption price per share equal to such liquidation value per share.
Under ASU 2014-08, a disposal transaction meets the definition of a discontinued operation if all of the following criteria are met:
1.
The disposal group constitutes a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity.
2.
The component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria, is disposed of by sale, or is disposed of other than by sale (e.g., “by abandonment, in an exchange measured based on the recorded amount of the nonmonetary asset relinquished, or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff”).
3.
The disposal of a component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) “represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results”.
Impact BioMedical Inc and its subsidiaries have financial reporting. The transaction is a disposal by sale and has a major effect on our financial results. Since it meets all of the test criteria set forth above, we have treated this disposal transaction as a discontinued operations in our financial statements.
On August 21, 2020, the transaction closed and Impact BioMedical Inc became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of DBHS. GBM received 483,334 shares of DSS common stock and 46,868 shares of DSS preferred stock, which preferred shares could be converted to 7,232,716 common shares (however, any conversion will be subject to the blocker GBM has agreed to, as described above). After this transaction, we held 500,001 shares of the common stock of DSS, representing 9.7% of the outstanding common stock of DSS. Our CEO, Chan Heng Fai is an owner of the common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we held) and is the executive chairman of the board of directors of DSS. The Company has elected the fair value option for the DSS common stock that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines the fair value of the financial assets. We value DSS common stock under level 1 category through quoted prices and preferred stock under level 2 category through the value of the common shares into which the preferred shares are convertible. The quoted price of DSS common stock was $6.95 as of August 21, 2020. The total fair value of DSS common and preferred stocks GBM received as consideration for the disposal of Impact BioMedical was $46,284,171. As of August 21, 2020, the net asset value of Impact BioMedical was $94,011. The difference of $46,190,160 was recorded as additional paid in capital. We did not recognize gain or loss from this transaction as it was a related party transaction.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the discontinued operation loss from Impact BioMedical Inc was $417,438 and $657,760, respectively.
On October 16, 2020, GBM converted an aggregate of 4,293 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 662,500 shares of the common stock of DSS. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 19.9% of the common stock of DSS, and our CEO, Chan Heng Fai, is also an owner of common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we hold).
Net Loss

Summary of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,644,698 in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5,958,434 in the same period of 2019. The lower sales and more property development expenses explain the increased cash flow used in operating activities. We received approximately $13.6 million from sales in the Ballenger Run project and invested approximately $4.2 million in land development projects of both Ballenger Run and Black Oak during the year ended December 31, 2020.

In 2020, we received $301,976 from the liquidation of Global Opportunity Fund. We also invested $200,000 in a promissory note of a related party and invested $201,229 in stock.

Real Property Financing Arrangements
Through Alset International, we have three property development projects. Ballenger Run and Black Oak projects are the major projects.
The Company anticipates that the estimated construction costs (not including land costs and financing costs) for the final phases of the Ballenger Run project will be $3 million. The expected completion date for the final phases of the Ballenger Run project is June of 2022.
The following table shows the Company’s forecasts of the phases of the development and costs for each phase of development for the Black Oak project, however, we are presently exploring alternate plans for Black Oak, which could lead to an expansion of the depth and breadth of our involvement in this project, depending on market interest, the outcome of discussions with potential partners and the availability of capital. Should we expand or otherwise alter our plans at the Black Oak project, the later stages of such project may have different time frames and costs.
Our Perth project in Australia is relatively small, representing approximately 2% of our total projects included in the estimated property costs and forecasted revenue, and the development plan of this project is contingent on the local market. We have been monitoring the local market, which has seen no significant improvement to date, and we will consider development once it is more confident in the market.
Black Oak
Black Oak is a 162-acre land infrastructure and subdivision project situated in Magnolia, Texas, north of Houston. This project is owned by certain subsidiaries of Alset International.
On July 20, 2018, 150 CCM Black Oak Ltd received $4,592,079 in reimbursement for previous construction costs incurred in the land development.

In 2019, $1,112,861 was released to reimburse the construction costs leaving a balance of $90,394 on December 31, 2019.

Ballenger Run
In November 2015, through LiquidValue Development, we completed the $15.7 million acquisition of Ballenger Run, a 197-acre land subdivision development located in Frederick County, Maryland. Previously, on May 28, 2014, the RBG Family, LLC entered into the Assignable Real Estate Sales Contract with NVR, Inc. (“NVR”) by which RBG Family, LLC would sell the 197 acres for $15 million to NVR. On December 10, 2014, NVR assigned this contract to SeD Maryland Development, LLC in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and entered into a series of Lot Purchase Agreements by which NVR would purchase subdivided lots from SeD Maryland Development, LLC (the “Lot Purchase Agreements”).
On November 23, 2015, SeD Maryland Development, LLC and Union Bank (formerly Xenith Bank and The Bank of Hampton Roads) entered into a Construction Loan Agreement, as amended by the Loan Modification Commitment Letter, as further amended by the Loan Modification Commitment Letter, dated as of August 30, 2017 and as further amended by the Third Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of September 18, 2017 (the “Union Bank Revolving Loan”). The Union Bank Revolving Loan closed simultaneous with the settlement on the land on November 23, 2015, and provided (i) for a maximum of $11 million outstanding; (ii) maturity on December 31, 2019; and (iii) an $800,000 letter of credit facility, with an annual rate of 15% on all issued letters of credit. On December 31, 2020 and 2019, the principal balance was $0. As part of the transaction, we incurred loan origination fees and closing fees, totaling $480,947, which were recorded as debt discount and were amortized over the life of the loan. The unamortized debt discounts were $0 on both December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The loan was secured by a deed of trust on the property, a minimum $2,600,000 of collateral cash, and a Limited Guaranty Agreement with SeD Ballenger. In September 2017, SeD Maryland Development, LLC and the Union Bank modified the related Revolving Credit Note, which increased the original principal amount from $8,000,000 to $11,000,000 and extended the maturity date of the loan and letter of credit to December 31, 2019.
The Union Bank Revolving Loan was intended to fund the development of the first 276 lots, the multi-family parcel and senior living parcel, the amenities associated with these phases, and certain road improvements. The Union Bank Revolving Loan was repaid in January 2019. On April 17, 2019, SeD Maryland Development LLC and Union Bank terminated the agreement.
On April 17, 2019, SeD Maryland Development LLC entered into a Development Loan Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) in the principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the sum of $8,000,000, with a cumulative loan advance amount of $18,500,000. The line of credit bears interest of LIBOR plus 375 basis points. SeD Maryland Development LLC was also provided with a Letter of Credit (“L/C”) Facility in an aggregate amount of $900,000. The L/C commission is 1.5% per annum on the face amount of the L/C. Other standard lender fees will apply in the event the L/C is drawn down. The L/C Facility is not a revolving loan, and amounts advanced and repaid may not be re-borrowed. Repayment of the Loan Agreement is secured by $2.6 million collateral fund and a Deed of Trust issued to the Lender on the property owned by SeD Maryland.
LIBOR is expected to be discontinued after 2021. Our line of credit agreement provides procedures for determining a replacement or alternative rate in the event that LIBOR is unavailable. However, there can be no assurances as to whether such replacement or alternative rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. We intend to monitor the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 and will work with our lenders to ensure any transition away from LIBOR will have minimal impact on our financial condition. We, however, can provide no assurances regarding the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR on the interest rate that we would be required to pay or on our financial condition.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the principal balance of the loan was $0. During 2019, as part of the transaction, the Company incurred loan origination fees and closing fees in the amount of $381,823 and capitalized them into construction in process.
Equity Security Investments
Investment Securities at Fair Value
The Company commonly holds investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments accounted for under the equity method, and investments at cost. Certain of the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
Prior to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, investments in equity securities were classified as either 1) available-for-sale securities, stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of related tax effects, were recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) or 2) trading securities, stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of related tax benefits, were recorded directly to net income (loss). With the adoption of ASU 2016-01, investments in equity securities are still stated at fair value, quoted by market prices, but all unrealized holding gains and losses are credited or charged to net income (loss) based on fair value measurement as the respective reporting date.
The Company accounts for certain of its investments in equity securities in accordance with ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825- 10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). In accordance with ASU 2016-01, the Company records all equity investments with readily determinable fair values at fair value calculated by the publicly traded stock price at the close of the reporting period. Amarantus BioScience Holdings (“AMBS”) is publicly traded company. The Company does not have significant influence over AMBS as the Company is the beneficial owner of approximately 5.4% of the common shares of AMBS. The stock fair value is determined by quoted stock prices.
The Company has elected the fair value option for the equity securities noted below that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Holista CollTech Limited (“Holista”), Document Securities Systems Inc. (“DSS”), Alset International and American Premium Water Corp (“APW”) are publicly traded companies and fair value is determined by quoted stock prices. The Company has significant influence but does not have a controlling interest in these investments, and therefore, the Company’s investment could be accounted for under the equity method of accounting or elect fair value accounting.
The Company has significant influence over DSS as we owned approximately 19.9% of the common stock of DSS as of December 31, 2020, and our Chief Executive Officer, Chan Heng Fai, is an owner of the common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we hold). In addition, our Chief Executive Officer is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of DSS. The Company did not have a controlling interest and therefore the Company’s investment would be accounted for under equity method accounting or could elect the fair value option accounting.
The Company had significant influence over Holista as the Company and its CEO are the beneficial owner of approximately 16.8% of the outstanding shares of Holista and our CEO has a position on the Board of Directors of Holista. The Company did not have a controlling interest and therefore the Company’s investment would be accounted for under equity method accounting or could elect the fair value option accounting.
The Company has significant influence over APW as the Company is the beneficial owner of approximately 9.99% of the common shares of APW and one officer from the Company holds a director position of APW’s board. The Company did not have a controlling interest and therefore the Company’s investment would be accounted for under equity method accounting or could elect the fair value option accounting.
The Company had significant influence over Alset International during the period of deconsolidation as the company’s beneficial ownership ranged between 49.62% and 49.11% in that period and our CEO is the CEO of Alset International. Chan Heng Fai is a director of both companies.
The Company has elected the fair value options for the equity securities noted above that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting to better match the measurement of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. APW, Holista and DSS are publicly traded companies and fair value of these equity investments is determined by the quoted stock prices. On December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value (calculated by market trading prices on the end dates of the periods) of total held equity stock of American Premium Water, Holista and DSS was $10,075,758 and $2,711,582, respectively.
The Company accounts for certain of its investments in real estate funds without readily determinable fair values in accordance with ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (“ASC 820”). As of December 31, 2019 the Company maintained an investment in a real estate fund, The Global Opportunity Fund. This fund invests primarily in the U.S. and met the criteria within ASC 820. Chan Heng Fai, the Chairman and CEO of the Company, was also one of the directors of the Global Opportunity Fund. The fair values of the investments in this class have been estimated using the net asset value of the Company’s ownership interest in Global Opportunity Fund. The fund was closed during November 2019 and is being liquidated. As of December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a receivable $307,944 from the Global Opportunity Fund.

We value APB warrants under level 3 category through a Black Scholes option pricing model and the fair value of the warrants from APW were $860,342 as of July 17, 2020, the purchase date and $862,723 as of December 31, 2020.

(“DBHS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Document Securities Systems Inc. (“DSS”), a related party of the Company, pursuant to which, DBHS agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Impact BioMedical Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GBM, through a share exchange. On August 21, 2020, the transaction closed and Impact BioMedical Inc became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of DBHS. GBM received 483,334 shares of DSS common stock and 46,868 shares of DSS preferred stock, which preferred shares could be converted to 7,232,716 common shares. On October 5, 2020 the Company converted 4,293 of these preferred shares into 662,500 common shares. The Company has elected the fair value option for the DSS common stock that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We value DSS preferred stock under level 3 category through the Option-Pricing Method (“OPM”) to allocate the equity value between common and preferred shares. The OPM relies on the Black-Scholes-Merton model. As of December 31, 2020, the fair market value of the DSS preferred stock was $37,675,000. For further details on this transaction, refer to Note 8 to Company’s Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions, Note 11 - Discontinued Operations and Note 12 - Investments Measured at Fair Value.
The changes in the fair values of the investment were recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Due to the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, these values may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed.
Investment Securities at Cost
The Company has a holding of 13.1% in Vivacitas Oncology Inc. (“Vivacitas”), a private company that is currently not listed on an exchange, with a purchase cost of $200,128. Vivacitas was acquired after the adoption of ASU 2016-01. The Company applied ASC 321 and elected the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820 to estimate fair value using the NAV per share.

Management believes its investment of 50% represents significant influence over Sweet Sense and accounts for the investment under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2018, BioLife had contributed $55,000 to the joint venture and recorded its proportionate share losses totaling $44,053 recorded as loss on investment in security by equity method in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss.
On November 8, 2019, Impact BioMedical Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, purchased 50% of Sweet Sense from QI for $91,000 and recorded a loss from acquisition in the amount of $90,001. As of November 8, 2019, the total investment in joint venture was equal to $91,000 and the proportionate losses totaled $90,001. The transaction was not in the scope of ASC 805 Business Combinations since the acquisition was accounted for an asset purchase instead of a business combination. As an asset acquisition, the Company recorded the transaction at cost and applied ASC 730 to expense in-process research and development cost, the major cost of Sweet Sense. Consequently, Sweet Sense was an 81.8% owned subsidiary of Alset International, and therefore, was consolidated into the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the investment losses from Sweet Sense was $44,053. As a subsidiary of Impact BioMedical Inc., Sweet Sense was in the discontinued operations of Impact BioMedical Inc.

Impact BioMedical Inc.
On April 27, 2020, Global BioMedical Pte Ltd (“GBM”), one of our subsidiaries, entered into a share exchange agreement with DSS BioHealth Security, Inc. (“DBHS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Document Securities Systems Inc. (“DSS”), pursuant to which, DBHS agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Impact BioMedical Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GBM, through a share exchange. It was agreed that the aggregate consideration to be issued to GBM for the Impact BioMedical shares would be the following: (i) 483,334 newly issued shares of DSS common stock; and (ii) 46,868 newly issued shares of a new series of DSS perpetual convertible preferred stock with a stated value of $46,868,000, or $1,000 per share. The convertible preferred stock can be convertible into shares of DSS common stock at a conversion price of $6.48 of preferred stock stated value per share of common stock, subject to a 19.9% beneficial ownership conversion limitation (a so-called “blocker”) based on the total issued outstanding shares of common stock of DSS beneficially owned by GBM. Holders of the convertible preferred stock will have no voting rights, except as required by applicable law or regulation, and no dividends will accrue or be payable on the convertible preferred stock. The holders of convertible preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and DSS will have the right to redeem all or any portion of the then outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, pro rata among all holders, at a redemption price per share equal to such liquidation value per share.
Under ASU 2014-08, a disposal transaction meets the definition of a discontinued operation if all of the following criteria are met:
1.
The disposal group constitutes a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity.
2.
The component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria, is disposed of by sale, or is disposed of other than by sale (e.g., “by abandonment, in an exchange measured based on the recorded amount of the nonmonetary asset relinquished, or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff”).
3.
The disposal of a component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) “represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results”.
Impact BioMedical Inc and its subsidiaries have financial reporting. The transaction is a disposal by sale and has a major effect on our financial results. Since it meets all of the test criteria set forth above, we have treated this disposal transaction as a discontinued operation in our financial statements.
On August 21, 2020, the transaction closed and Impact BioMedical Inc became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of DBHS. GBM received 483,334 shares of DSS common stock and 46,868 shares of DSS preferred stock, which preferred shares could be converted to 7,232,716 common shares (however, any conversion will be subject to the blocker GBM has agreed to, as described above). After this transaction, we held 500,001 shares of the common stock of DSS, representing 9.7% of the outstanding common stock of DSS. Our CEO, Chan Heng Fai is the owner of the common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we held) and is the executive chairman of the board of directors of DSS. The Company has elected the fair value option for the DSS common stock that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines the fair value of the financial assets. We value DSS common stock under level 1 category through quoted prices and preferred stock under level 2 category through the value of the common shares into which the preferred shares are convertible. The quoted price of DSS common stock was $6.95 as of August 21, 2020. The total fair value of DSS common and preferred stocks GBM received as consideration for the disposal of Impact BioMedical was $46,284,171. As of August 21, 2020, the net asset value of Impact BioMedical was $94,011. The difference of $46,190,160 was recorded as additional paid in capital. We did not recognize gain or loss from this transaction as it was a related party transaction.
On October 16, 2020, GBM converted an aggregate of 4,293 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 662,500 shares of the common stock of DSS. We owned approximately 19.9% of the common stock of DSS, and our CEO, Chan Heng Fai, is also an owner of the common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we hold).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates
The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on the intercompany loans (under ASC 830), which mostly consist of loans from Singapore to the United States and which were approximately $24.8 million and $35.8 million on December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are the reason for the significant fluctuation of foreign currency transaction Gain or Loss on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Because the intercompany loan balances between Singapore and United States will remain at approximately $25 million over the next year, we expect this fluctuation of foreign exchange rates to still significantly impact the results of operations in 2021, especially given that the foreign exchange rate may and is expected to be volatile. If the amount of intercompany loan is lowered in the future, the effect will also be reduced. However, at this moment, we do not expect to repay the intercompany loans in the short term.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption.
Controls and Procedures
We are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements included in this Report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management’s judgment and estimates concerning effects of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.
Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable data. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
In order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. In connection with management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, management determined that our company did not maintain effective controls over financial reporting due to having a limited staff with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience. Management determined that the ineffective controls over financial reporting constitute a material weakness. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to appoint additional qualified personnel with financial accounting, GAAP and SEC experience.
This Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Report.
