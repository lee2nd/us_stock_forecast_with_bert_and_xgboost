ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
GrowLife persevered through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as the Cannabis industry was classified an essential business by 36 States where it is medicinally legal and 16 States where it is completely legal. Our GrowLife team worked remotely where it could reach out to customers and channels to facilitate sales. Overall market studies reported 35% industry growth in 2020 in spite of COVID-19. However, our revenue declined 15%; the first declining year since 2016. Our revenue reduction of approximately $1.2 million was the result of a $2.9 million reduction in our hydroponics segments partially offset by a $1.7 million increase at EZ-CLONE Enterprises. Like the prior year’s 78% revenue growth, we had expected another revenue growth year in 2020, despite winding down our hydroponics segment. Unfortunately, we experienced continuing supply chain problems with our manufacturing subsidiary wherein they could not keep up with the GrowLife sales orders, resulting in limitation of our fourth quarter EZ-CLONE revenue to $2 million as a result of the backlog. On the positive side, annual gross margins rose from 31.0% to 42.5% year over year and general and administrative expenses were significantly reduced from $7 million to $4.9 million. These aggregated expenses were in spite of our expansion plans and spending into the clone market, which our cloning manufacturer was part of, and we had announced in 2019.
Also previously reported, we did not close the purchase of the remaining 49% of stock of EZ-CLONE that was due on July 15, 2020 and the founders of EZ-CLONE entered into litigation against the Company. Each of our 2020 10-Q filings revealed increasing quarter over quarter backlogs of EZ-CLONE product delivery in response to sales pointing to the manufacturer’s inability to keep up with GrowLife’s increasing sales and customer demand. In the first quarter it was $400,000 of sales backlog that was deferred into the second quarter; in the second quarter we could not recognize $1 million of GrowLife sales because EZ-CLONE supply chain and backlog issues; and finally in the third quarter, only $1.4 million of revenue was recognized and another $2 million of GrowLife sales was backlogged into the 4th quarter because of supply chain and shipment problems. Based on the backlogged orders, we estimate we were unable to recognize the approximately $2 million in revenue.
As we pointed out in the third quarter 10-Q, we recognized the saturation issue in the Hemp CBD market and postponed our entry into the clone/starter business until 2021 which has not subsided. However, as we look at the Cannabis industry, we can make three observations from early 2021: First, the MORE Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives on December 4, 2020, a landmark step toward the federal legalization of Cannabis that can permit interstate commerce and true US companies to touch the plant and trade on the stock exchange; Second, Senate Majority Leader Schumer announced in early April that he will move the legalization bill forward in the US Senate and seek support with the White House to obtain federal legalization; Finally, GrowLife retains its 51% assets in EZ-CLONE, investors are aligned and financially support GrowLife to settle with EZ-CLONE as well as expand in new markets, and our management depth remains in place to grow as opportunities are identified.
Therefore, we see a growing market, intend to service our customers and will continue to seek opportunities in the legal Cannabis industry. We believe this is a great opportunity for our customers, shareholders and one where GrowLife is uniquely positioned to capitalize on. The Company’s goal is to become the nation’s largest cultivation facility service provider focused on propagation systems serving more cultivators with products of high quality, exceptional value and competitive price.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information and presentation of that data as a percentage of change from year-to-year.

The decrease resulted from lower hydroponic sales from the decision during 2020 to exit the hydroponics business and the elimination of the hydroponics sales personnel and the impact of the pandemic on the hydroponics segment during the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increased performance of EZ-CLONE revenue is a direct result of the substantial money and resources Growlife provides to its EZ-Clone subsidiary.

We expect losses to continue as we implement our business plan.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, requires that management evaluate whether there are relevant conditions and events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. However, since inception, we have sustained significant operating losses and such losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $154.8 million, cash and cash equivalents of $383,000 and a working capital deficit of $5.974 million excluding derivative liability, convertible debt, right of use liability and deferred revenue). Additionally, we used cash in operating activities of $1,951,000 and $2,910,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We will require additional cash funding to fund operations beyond May 31, 2021. Accordingly, management has concluded that we do not have sufficient funds to support operations within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and, therefore, we concluded there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
To fund further operations, we will need to raise additional capital. We may obtain additional financing in the future through the issuance of its common stock, or through other equity or debt financings. Our ability to continue as a going concern or meet the minimum liquidity requirements in the future is dependent on its ability to raise significant additional capital, of which there can be no assurance. If the necessary financing is not obtained or achieved, we will likely be required to reduce its planned expenditures, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and our ability to achieve its strategic objective. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The financial statements contain no adjustments for the outcome of these uncertainties. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, financial position and cash flows.

Our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 are summarized in the table below:
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The application of GAAP involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described in Note 3 to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
Accounts Receivable and Revenue - We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires the application of the five-step-principles-based-accounting-model for revenue recognition. These steps include (1) a legally enforceable contract, written or unwritten is identified; (2) performance obligations in the contracts are identified; (3) the transaction price reflecting variable consideration, if any, is identified; (4) the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations; and (5) revenue is recognized when the control of goods is transferred to the customer at a particular time or over time. Our hydroponic sales were cash or credit card. Our EZ-CLONE sales include credit cash, payments in advance, 3% discount upon receipt and, we extend thirty day terms to select customers. Accounts receivable are reviewed periodically for collectability. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts totaling $5,690.
Inventories - Inventories are recorded on a first in first out basis Inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods and components sold by EZ-CLONE to it distribution customers. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. The reserve for inventory was approximately $51,000 and $0 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments - ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
Level 2 - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and.
Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
The recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments -We evaluate all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
Stock Based Compensation - We have share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options to purchase shares of our common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost is measured by us at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period using an estimated forfeiture rate. For options issued to employees, we recognize stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit. Grants of stock options and stock to non-employees and other parties are accounted for in accordance with the ASC 718.
Convertible Securities - Based upon ASC 815-15, we have adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities issued subsequent to December 31, 2015. We will evaluate our contracts based upon the earliest issuance date.
