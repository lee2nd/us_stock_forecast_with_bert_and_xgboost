Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
For a description of the Company’s business, refer to Item 1 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K. As indicated in Item 1, the Company, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales. The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include: (1) real estate land development cost of sales calculations, which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete; (2) cash flows, asset groupings and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived assets (including real estate inventories) and assets held for sale; (3) actuarially determined defined benefit pension plan obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures; (4) risk assessment of uncertain tax positions; and (5) the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
There are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas. Management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience, third-party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following:
· real estate land development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project, and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies, but not yet incurred;
· when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, a test for asset impairment may be required. Asset impairment determinations are based upon the intended use of assets, the grouping of those assets, the expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets. For real estate projects under development, an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is determined using estimated future expenditures necessary to complete such projects and using management’s best estimates about sales prices and holding periods. Testing of long-lived assets includes an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using estimated revenue streams, operating margins, administrative expenses and terminal values. The estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of future revenues and costs, as well as future events and conditions. If the excess of undiscounted cash flows over the carrying value of a particular asset group is small, there is a greater risk of future impairment and any resulting impairment charges could be material;
· defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan accounting and disclosures are based upon numerous assumptions and estimates, including the expected rate of investment return on pension plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities, and certain employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;
· the Company assesses risk for uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities; and
· the Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this determination, the Company projects its future earnings (including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory) for the future recoverability of net deferred tax assets.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended April 30, 2021 Compared to Year Ended April 30, 2020
For 2021, the Company had net income of $7,392,000, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5,903,000, or $0.73 per share, in 2020. The net loss in 2020 included $8,600,000 of non-cash charges which included (1) a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement loss of $2,929,000 due to the payment of lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees and (2) net non-cash pre-tax impairment charges on other assets of $5,046,000 in connection with the termination of certain real estate leases.
Revenues. The following presents information on revenues for the Company’s operations (dollars in thousands):
(a)	Percentage not meaningful.
· Land sale revenues for 2021 were higher than 2020 by $9,199,000 primarily due to increased demand for lots by builders. The Company’s land sale revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands):
The increase in the average selling price per acre of developed residential land in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the location of the sold property and increased demand for lots by builders. The increase in the average selling price per acre of undeveloped residential land in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the location of the sold property and increased demand in the market.
· Home sale revenues for 2021 were higher than 2020 by $3,079,000 due to the Company completing its first home sales to customers during 2021. The Company closed on 14 homes during 2021 at an average selling price of $220,000. As of April 30, 2021, the Company had 33 homes in production, including 23 homes under contract, which homes under contract represented $6,567,000 of expected sales revenue when closed, subject to customer cancellations and change orders. The Company’s homebuilding operations did not generate revenue during 2020.
· Rental revenues for 2021 were lower than 2020 by $80,000 due to a decrease in rent received from tenants at the Company’s buildings in Palm Coast, Florida offset in part by rental revenues for a retail building in the Las Fuentes at Panorama Village subdivision in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. The Company owned a 14,000 square foot, single tenant retail building in the Las Fuentes at Panorama Village subdivision in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, which was leased to a third party during 2021 and which was sold in 2021. The Company owns a 143,000 square foot warehouse and office facility located in Palm Coast, Florida, which was leased to a third party through August 2020 and a portion of which is leased to a third party after August 2020. The Company owned a 61,000 square foot warehouse and office facility located in Palm Coast, Florida in 2021, which was leased to a third party through August 2020 and which was sold in 2021.
1Revenues per lot may not calculate precisely due to the rounding of revenues to the nearest thousand dollars.
· Building sales and other revenues for 2021 were higher than 2020 by $9,088,000. Building sales and other revenues consists of (in thousands):
Sales of buildings and other land for 2021 consisted of $5,493,000 with respect to the sale of a 14,000 square foot, single tenant retail building in the Las Fuentes at Panorama Village subdivision in Rio Rancho, New Mexico and $4,000,000 with respect to the sale of a 61,000 square foot warehouse and office facility located in Palm Coast, Florida. Sales of buildings and other land for 2020 consisted of the sale of two undeveloped properties in Palm Coast, Florida.
Miscellaneous other revenues for 2021 primarily consisted of payments for impact fee credits, installation of telecommunications equipment in subdivisions and profit on land used in homebuilding. Miscellaneous other revenues for 2020 primarily consisted of forfeited deposits and non-refundable option payments.
Cost of Revenues. The following presents information on cost of revenues for the Company’s operations (dollars in thousands):
(a)	Percentage not meaningful.
· Land sale cost of revenues for 2021 were higher than 2020 by $3,988,000. The average gross profit percentage on land sales in New Mexico before indirect costs was 31.3% for 2021 compared to 16.7% for 2020. The profit percentage increase was attributable to the lower than estimated costs associated with certain completed projects and demand for lots by builders resulting in higher revenue per developed lot. As a result of many factors, including the nature and timing of specific transactions and the type and location of land being sold, revenues, average selling prices and related average gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods.
· Home sale cost of revenues for 2021 were higher than 2020 by $2,584,000 due to the Company completing its first home sales to customers during 2021. Home sale gross margin was 16.1% for 2021.
· Building sales and other cost of revenues for 2021 consisted of $3,308,000 with respect to the sale of a 14,000 square foot, single tenant retail building in the Las Fuentes at Panorama Village subdivision in Rio Rancho, New Mexico and $2,414,000 with respect to the sale of a 61,000 square foot warehouse and office facility located in Palm Coast, Florida.
General and Administrative Expenses. The following presents information on general and administrative expenses for the Company’s operations (dollars in thousands):
(a)	Percentage not meaningful.
· Land development general and administrative expenses for 2021 were higher than 2020 by $110,000 primarily due to additional employees added during the fiscal year. The Company did not record any non-cash impairment charges on real estate inventory or investment assets in 2021 or 2020. Due to volatility in market conditions and development costs, the Company may experience future impairment charges.
· Homebuilding general and administrative expenses for 2021 were higher than 2020 by $603,000 due to homebuilding being a new business segment.
· Corporate general and administrative expenses for 2021 were lower than 2020 by $8,250,000 primarily due to a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement loss of $2,929,000 in 2020 as a result of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $7,280,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees and a non-cash impairment charge on other assets of $5,046,000 in 2020. The non-cash impairment charge represented the remaining present value of lease payments expected to be received by the Company for buildings located in Palm Coast, Florida deemed to be consideration with respect to the sale of a former business segment offset by the receipt of $625,000 received in connection with a settlement agreement related to such sale (refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the sale of a former business segment and related settlement agreement).
Interest (expense) income, net decreased to $(40,000) for 2021 from $334,000 for 2020, primarily due to a reduction in interest rates on cash balances and the elimination of the deferred purchase price and interest accrual related thereto with respect to the sale of a former business segment (refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the non-cash impairment charge of the deferred purchase price related to the sale of a former business segment).
Other income of $1,028,000 for 2021 primarily consisted of a settlement payment of $650,000 from a former business segment (refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the settlement agreement) and $300,000 of debt forgiveness with respect to a loan received by the Company pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the debt forgiveness).
The Company had a provision for income taxes of $2,643,000 for 2021 compared to a benefit for income taxes of $1,722,000 for 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
AMREP Corporation is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. As a holding company, AMREP Corporation is dependent on its available cash and on cash from subsidiaries to pay expenses and fund operations. The Company’s liquidity is affected by many factors, including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the real estate industry and the economy generally.
The Company’s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations, bank financing for specific real estate projects, a revolving line of credit and existing cash balances. Land and homebuilding properties generally cannot be sold quickly, and the ability of the Company to sell properties has been and will continue to be affected by market conditions. The ability of the Company to generate cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the timeframes the Company has established for each property. The development of additional lots for sale, construction of homes or pursuing other real estate projects will require financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms (or at all). If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected.
COVID-19 Impact and Response
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Subsequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread and various state and local governments have issued or extended “shelter-in-place” orders, which have impacted and restricted various aspects of the Company’s operations.
In response to the pandemic, the Company allowed all employees to work remotely during March and April 2020, with most operations in New Mexico returning to an office setting beginning in May 2020. In New Mexico, the Company’s construction operations have continued functioning during this period subject to regulated restrictions and safety constraints in order to protect the Company’s employees, trade contractors and homebuilder customers. The Company modified many of its common interactions to be virtual and attempted to minimize in-person interactions. While the above-referenced steps are necessary and appropriate in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, they did, and in some cases still do, impact the Company’s ability to operate in its ordinary and traditional course. Those restrictions, combined with a reduction in the availability, capacity and efficiency of municipal and private services necessary to progress land development and homebuilding, have reduced the Company’s sales pace and delayed certain projects and deliveries. The potential magnitude and duration of the business and economic impacts from the unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19 are uncertain. In addition, the Company can provide no assurance as to whether the COVID-19 public health effort will be intensified to such an extent that the Company will not be able to conduct any business operations for an indefinite period.
While we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic or if there will be additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which the Company operates, an extended economic slowdown could materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows. The Company could be negatively impacted over the medium-to-longer term if the disruptions related to COVID-19 (a) decrease consumer confidence generally or with respect to purchasing a home or cause civil unrest, (b) precipitate a prolonged economic downturn or an extended rise in unemployment or tempering of wage growth, any of which could lower demand for the Company’s products, impair the Company’s ability to sell and build finished lots and homes in a typical manner or at all, impair the Company’s ability to generate revenues and cash flows, or impair the Company’s ability to access the capital or lending markets (or significantly increase the costs of doing so), (c) increase the costs or decrease the supply of construction materials or the availability of subcontractors and other talent, including as a result of infections or medically necessary or recommended self-quarantining, or governmental mandates to direct production activities to support public health efforts or (d) result in the Company recognizing charges in future periods, which may be material, for impairments related to the Company’s inventory or investment assets. The unprecedented uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, due to rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, macroeconomic consequences and market reactions thereto, also makes it more challenging for the Company to estimate the future performance of the business and develop strategies to generate growth.
Should the adverse impacts described above (or others that are currently unknown) occur, whether individually or collectively, the Company would expect to experience, among other things, increases in defaults under customer contracts, and decreases in future demand for finished lots and homes, possibly resulting in reduced revenues and profitability. Such impacts could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company could also be forced to reduce its average selling prices in order to generate homebuilder or homebuyer demand or in reaction to competitive pressures. In addition, should the COVID-19 public health effort intensify to such an extent that the Company cannot operate in Rio Rancho, the Company could generate few or no sales during the applicable period, which could be prolonged. If there are prolonged government restrictions on the Company’s operations or the Company’s employees, trade contractors or customers, or an extended economic recession, the Company could be unable to produce revenues and cash flows sufficient to conduct operations, meet the terms of the Company’s covenants and other requirements under its financing arrangements or service the Company’s outstanding debt. Such a circumstance could, among other things, exhaust the Company’s available liquidity (and ability to access liquidity sources) or trigger an acceleration to pay a significant portion or all of the Company’s then-outstanding debt obligations, which the Company may be unable to do.
Pension Plan
The Company has a defined benefit pension plan for which accumulated benefits were frozen and future service credits were curtailed as of March 1, 2004. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company’s defined benefit pension plan was underfunded as of April 30, 2021 by $476,000, with $21,102,000 of assets and $21,578,000 of liabilities, and was underfunded as of April 30, 2020 by $5,014,000, with $18,260,000 of assets and $23,274,000 of liabilities. The pension plan liabilities were determined using a weighted average discount interest rate of 2.48% per year as of April 30, 2021 and 2.29% per year as of April 30, 2020, which are based on the FTSE Pension Discount Curve as of such dates as it corresponds to the projected liability requirements of the pension plan. As of April 30, 2021, for each 0.25% increase in the weighted average discount interest rate, the pension plan liabilities are forecasted to decrease by $457,000 and for each 0.25% decrease in the weighted average discount interest rate, the pension plan liabilities are forecasted to increase by $475,000. As of April 30, 2021, the effect of every 0.25% change in the investment rate of return on pension plan assets would increase or decrease the subsequent year’s pension expense by $49,500, and the effect of every 0.25% change in the weighted average discount interest rate would increase or decrease the subsequent year’s pension expense by $13,000. The Company made voluntary contributions to the pension plan of $1,847,000 and $3,600,000 during 2021 and 2020. The Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement loss of $2,929,000 in 2020 due to the Company’s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $7,280,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees. There were no such charges in 2021.

The Company recorded, net of tax, other comprehensive income of $1,844,000 in 2021 and $564,000 in 2020, reflecting the change in accrued pension costs in each year net of the related deferred tax and unrecognized prepaid pension amounts. The Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement loss of $2,929,000 for 2020 due to the Company’s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $7,280,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees.
Financing Activities
Notes payable, net decreased from $3,890,000 as of April 30, 2020 to $3,448,000 as of April 30, 2021, primarily due to repayments made on outstanding borrowings partially offset by additional borrowings to fund land development activities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
IMPACT OF INFLATION
The Company’s operations can be impacted by inflation. Inflation can cause increases in the cost of land, materials, services, interest and labor. Unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies, operating margins will decrease. The Company’s homebuilding segment as well as homebuilders that are customers of the Company’s land development business segment face inflationary concerns that rising housing costs, including interest costs, may substantially outpace increases in the incomes of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to purchase a new home or sell an owned home. If this situation were to exist, the demand for homes produced by the Company’s homebuilding segment could decrease and the demand for the Company’s land by homebuilder customers could decrease. In general, in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the Company’s markets, and as a result the Company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its business. Despite low inflation, the Company’s operations are experiencing price increases as a result of recent tariffs and labor and material shortages. Inflation may also increase the Company’s financing costs. While the Company attempts to pass on to its customers increases in costs through increased sales prices, market forces may limit the Company’s ability to do so. If the Company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, the Company’s revenues, gross margins and net income could be adversely affected.
