Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with “Forward-Looking Statements” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The discussion and analysis below is focused on our 2020 and 2019 financial results, including comparisons of our year-over-year performance between these years. Discussion and analysis of our 2018 fiscal year specifically, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2019 financial performance to 2018, is located in Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2020, which is available on our website at www.orthofix.com and the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
Executive Summary
We are a global medical device and biologics company with a spine and extremities focus. Headquartered in Lewisville, Texas, we have two reporting segments: Global Spine and Global Extremities. Our spine and orthopedic extremities products are distributed in over 70 countries via our sales representatives and distributors.
Notable financial results in 2020 include the following:
•
Net sales were $406.6 million, a decrease of 11.6% on a reported basis and 11.8% on a constant currency basis
•
U.S. Spinal Implants net sales of $77.8 million, an increase $4.9 million, or 6.7%, on a reported basis
•
U.S. Motion Preservation net sales of $18.4 million, an increase of $14.3 million, or 344.3% on a reported basis
•
Net cash from operating activities of $74.3 million, an increase of $42.2 million or 131.9%
COVID-19 Update and Outlook
The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic has significantly affected our patients, communities, employees and business operations. The pandemic has led to the cancellation or deferral of elective surgeries and procedures within certain hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and other medical facilities; restrictions on travel; the implementation of physical distancing measures; and the temporary or permanent closure of businesses. In addition, broad economic factors resulting from the pandemic, including increased unemployment rates and reduced consumer spending, are affecting our patients and partners. These circumstances have negatively affected the sales of our products, particularly during the period from March 2020 through May 2020 when elective surgery restrictions were most pronounced, though these effects remain ongoing in certain geographical areas. However, we remain focused on protecting the health and wellbeing of our employees, partners, patients, and the communities in which we operate while assuring the continuity of our business operations.
At this time, the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, both in the U.S. and in other markets. Although we anticipate that there will be vaccines widely distributed in the future, the timing and efficacy of such vaccines are uncertain.
Given these various uncertainties, it is unclear the extent to which lingering slowdowns in elective procedures will affect our business into 2021 and beyond. We expect that the effects of COVID-19 on our business will depend on various factors including (i) the magnitude and length of any additional in case waves, (ii) the distribution, efficacy, and public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines (iii) the comfort level of patients in returning to clinics and hospitals, (iv) the extent to which localized elective surgery shutdowns occur, (v) the unemployment rate’s effect on potential patients lacking medical insurance coverage, and (vi) general hospital capacity constraints occurring because of the need to treat COVID-19 patients.
In addition, while we have not seen such effects to date, risk remains that COVID-19 could have material negative effects on contractual counterparties, leading to supply chain disruptions or counterparty payment defaults and bankruptcies (including bankruptcies to hospital systems that significantly rely on revenue from elective surgeries).
Results of Operations
The following table presents certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percent of net sales:
Net Sales by Reporting Segment
The following table provides net sales by major product category by reporting segment:
Global Spine
Global Spine offers the following products categories:
-
Bone Growth Therapies, which manufactures, distributes, sells, and provides support services for market leading devices that enhance bone fusion. Bone Growth Therapies uses distributors and sales representatives to sell its devices and provide associated services to hospitals, healthcare providers, and patients.
-
Spinal Implants, which designs, develops and markets a broad portfolio of motion preservation and fixation implant products used in surgical procedures of the spine. Spinal Implants distributes its products globally through a network of distributors and sales representatives to sell spine products to hospitals and healthcare providers.
-
Biologics, which provides a portfolio of regenerative products and tissue forms that allow physicians to successfully treat a variety of spinal and orthopedic conditions. Biologics markets its tissues to hospitals and healthcare providers, primarily in the U.S., through a network of employed and independent sales representatives.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net sales decreased $35.5 million or 9.9%
•
Bone Growth Therapies net sales decreased $25.8 million or 13.1%, primarily driven by the disruption caused by COVID-19, which has led to lower order volumes
•
Spinal Implants net sales increased $0.3 million or 0.3%, in spite of the disruption caused by COVID-19, as Motion Preservation net sales increased $11.7 million as a result of increases in case volumes and active surgeons, as the U.S. market continues to adopt our M6-C artificial cervical disc
•
Biologics net sales decreased $10.0 million or 15.3%, primarily driven by lower procedure volumes as a result of the disruption caused by COVID-19 and continued pricing pressure observed within this market
Global Extremities
Global Extremities offers products and solutions that allow physicians to successfully treat a variety of orthopedic conditions unrelated to the spine. Global Extremities distributes its products globally through a network of distributors and sales representatives to sell orthopedic products to hospitals and healthcare providers.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net sales decreased $17.9 million, or 17.4%
•
Decrease of $18.7 million, primarily a result of the impact of COVID-19 on procedure volumes, particularly with our international stocking distributors
•
Partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a positive impact on net sales for 2020
Gross Profit
2020 Compared to 2019
Gross profit decreased $54.7 million, or 15.2%
•
Decrease primarily due to the decline in net sales and lower fixed cost absorption, primarily attributable to COVID-19 and its negative effect on elective procedure volumes
•
Decrease also partially due to the recognition of non-cash inventory charges on products due to lower procedure volumes, largely as a result of COVID-19
Sales and Marketing Expense
2020 Compared to 2019
Sales and marketing expense decreased $19.2 million
•
Decrease largely attributable to reduced commissions as a result of the decline in net sales, partially offset by commission support provided to our direct sales representatives during the second quarter of 2020
•
Decrease in travel, entertainment, and marketing expenses related to the cancellation of several sales events and conferences in 2020 and the leveraging of virtual trainings and events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
General and Administrative Expense
2020 Compared to 2019
General and administrative expense decreased $17.7 million
•
Decrease of $9.0 million attributable to lower succession and transition charges, including acceleration of certain share-based compensation expense, relating to the retirement, transition, or termination of certain executive officers and from targeted restructuring activities
•
Decrease of $6.3 million in expenses associated with lower strategic investments, largely due to diligence and integration costs associated with strategic initiatives
•
Decrease of $2.6 million attributable to lower legal judgments and settlements
Research and Development Expense
2020 Compared to 2019
Research and development expense increased $4.4 million
•
Increase of $2.8 million related to costs to comply with recent medical device reporting regulations
•
Remaining increase primarily the result of our efforts to build out our internal team to support the acceleration of our new product innovation initiative
Acquisition-related Amortization and Remeasurement
2020 Compared to 2019
Acquisition-related amortization and remeasurement decreased $34.7 million
•
Decrease of $36.4 million primarily related to the remeasurement of potential future revenue-based milestone payments associated with the Spinal Kinetics acquisition that become due upon achievement of certain revenue targets, primarily attributable to the effects and uncertainty of COVID-19 as it relates to the estimated likelihood and timing of potential milestone payments
•
Partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations or asset acquisitions
Non-operating Expense
Non-operating income and expense largely consists of interest income and expense, transaction gains and losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in fair value related to our equity holdings in certain privately-held companies, and credit losses recognized on certain convertible debt investments. Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily a result of several of our foreign subsidiaries holding trade and intercompany payables or receivables in currencies (most notably the U.S. Dollar) other than their functional currency.
2020 Compared to 2019
Interest expense, net, increased $2.4 million
•
Decrease of $1.5 million attributable interest income recognized on our investment in eNeura in 2019
•
Increase of $0.8 million associated with interest expense incurred on our outstanding indebtedness under our secured revolving credit facility
Other income (expense), net, increased $16.5 million
•
Increase of $6.5 million associated with an other-than-temporary impairment on the eNeura debt security in 2019, prior to its settlement
•
Increase of $5.3 million associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as we recorded a non-cash remeasurement gain of $3.9 million in 2020 compared to a loss of $1.4 million in 2019
•
Increase of $4.7 million attributable to funds received from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the Provider Relief Fund included within the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”)
Income Taxes
2020 Effective Tax Rate
The increase in the effective tax rate during the year was primarily a result of the statute expirations of uncertain tax positions and the reduction in contingent consideration, offset by the increase in income before income taxes, increases in valuation allowance, and non-deductible executive compensation. The primary factors affecting our tax rate for 2020 are as follows:
•
Statute expirations and effective settlement of uncertain tax positions
•
Valuation allowance recognized on certain foreign deferred tax assets
•
Non-taxable decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration
•
Executive compensation that is not deductible as a result of the Tax Act
•
State tax and foreign income taxed at differing rates
2019 Effective Tax Rate
The decrease in the effective tax rate during the year was primarily a result of the decrease in income before income taxes, full year benefit of our Domestication completed in 2018, and statute expirations and effective settlement of uncertain tax positions, offset by non-deductible executive compensation and non-deductible increase in contingent consideration. The primary factors affecting our tax rate for 2019 are as follows:
•
Non-deductible increases in the fair value of contingent consideration
•
Statute expirations and effective settlement of uncertain tax positions
•
Executive compensation that is not deductible as a result of the Tax Act
•
State taxes and foreign income taxed at differing rates
Segment Review
Our business is managed through two reporting segments: Global Spine and Global Extremities. The primary metric used in managing the business by segment is EBITDA (which is described further in Note 16 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report).
The following table reconciles EBITDA to income (loss) before income taxes:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at December 31, 2020 was $96.8 million compared to $70.4 million at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash from operating activities.
Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities increased $42.2 million
•
Increase in net income (loss) of $31.0 million
•
Net decrease of $37.8 million in non-cash gains and losses, largely related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, and interest and loss on valuation of investment securities
•
Net increase of $49.1 million relating to changes in working capital accounts, primarily attributable to changes in accounts receivable, a $13.9 million prepayment received under the Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, inventories, and other current and long-term assets and liabilities, which included the expiration of statute of limitations related to certain unrecognized tax benefits.
Two of our primary working capital accounts are accounts receivable and inventory. Day’s sales in receivables were 57 days at December 31, 2020 compared to 66 days at December 31, 2019 (calculated using fourth quarter net sales and ending accounts receivable), largely due to strong collection efforts on accounts receivable, coupled with a slight decrease in net sales for the quarter. Inventory turns remained consistent at 1.2 times as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities decreased $29.4 million
•
Decrease of $18.0 million associated with cash paid in 2020 to acquire assets associated with the FITBONE intramedullary lengthening system for limb lengthening of the femur and tibia bones
•
Decrease of $10.0 million associated with our investments in Neo Medical SA, in the form of preferred stock and a convertible loan agreement
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities increased $13.9 million
•
Increase of $13.7 million associated with the payment of the Spinal Kinetics FDA Milestone in 2019, which represented the acquisition-date fair value attributable to the FDA Milestone liability originally recognized
Credit Facilities
On October 25, 2019, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), which provides for a five year $300 million secured revolving credit facility. The Amended Credit Agreement has a maturity date of October 25, 2024, and amends and restates the previous $125 million secured revolving credit facility.
Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement may be used for, among other things, working capital and other general corporate purposes (including share repurchases, permitted acquisitions and permitted payments of dividends and other distributions). Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement may be limited based upon EBITDA levels recognized over the preceding 12 months.
In April 2020, as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in response to the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we completed a borrowing of $100.0 million under our secured revolving credit facility. We repaid the $100.0 million in borrowings in the third quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we have no outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement. For additional information regarding the credit facility, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
In addition, we have no borrowings outstanding on our €5.5 million ($6.7 million) available line of credit in Italy as of December 31, 2020. This unsecured line of credit provides us the option to borrow amounts in Italy at rates which are determined at the time of borrowing.
Other
For information regarding Contingencies, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Impact of COVID-19 and the CARES Act on Liquidity and Capital Resources
In April 2020, as precautionary measures to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in response to the uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic, we (i) completed a borrowing of $100.0 million under our secured revolving credit facility (which was subsequently repaid in full in the third quarter of 2020), (ii) instituted temporary salary reductions for U.S. employees and the Board of Directors, which were in effect for two months during the second quarter of 2020, (iii) suspended the 401(k) match program through the remainder of fiscal year 2020, and (iv) initiated organizational travel restrictions and a temporary reduction in new hiring.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into U.S. federal law, which provided emergency assistance and health care for individuals, families, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In April 2020, we received $13.9 million in funds from the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 1, 2020, the President of the United States signed the “Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act,” which relaxed previously existing recoupment terms for providers and suppliers that received funds from the program. Under these new terms, recoupment will be delayed until one year after payment was issued. After that first year, Medicare will automatically recoup 25% of Medicare payments otherwise owed to the provider or supplier for 11 months. At the end of the 11-month period, recoupment will increase to 50% for another 6 months.
Thus, during these time periods, rather than receiving the full amount of payment for newly submitted claims, our outstanding accelerated / advance payment balance will be reduced by the recoupment amount until the full balance has been repaid.
In addition, in April 2020, we automatically received, without request, $4.7 million in funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the Provider Relief Fund. Upon review of the qualifying criteria required to retain the funding, which primarily relate to lost revenues or the incurrence of expenses attributable to COVID-19, it was determined that we met the criteria to retain the funds received.
Further, as part of the CARES Act, we were permitted to defer all employer social security payroll tax payments for the remainder of the 2020 calendar year, such that 50% of the taxes are deferred until December 31, 2021, with the remaining 50% deferred until December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred $0.6 million associated with this program. This deferred balance was subsequently repaid in the first quarter of 2021.
Given the various uncertainties attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic that remain, both in the U.S. and in other markets, our liquidity may be impacted in the future by the potential of continued decreases in elective surgical procedures, delays in payments from customers, facility closures, or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the extent to which COVID-19 is likely to materially impact our liquidity in the future remains uncertain.
Spinal Kinetics Acquisition and Contingent Consideration
As part of the consideration for the Spinal Kinetics acquisition, we agreed to milestone payments in the future of up to $60.0 million in cash. One milestone payment, which was for $15.0 million, became due upon FDA approval of Spinal Kinetics’ M6-C artificial cervical disc (the “FDA Milestone”). The FDA Milestone was achieved and paid in 2019.
The remaining milestone payments are comprised of revenue-based milestone payments of up to $45.0 million in connection with future sales of the acquired artificial discs. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement as of December 31, 2020 was $35.4 million; however, the actual amount ultimately paid could be higher or lower than the fair value of the contingent consideration (though not greater than $45.0 million). As of December 31, 2020, we classified $14.9 million of the liability attributable to the revenue-based milestone within other current liabilities, as we expect to pay one of the revenue-based milestones in the next twelve months, and the remaining $20.5 million within other long-term liabilities. For additional discussion of this matter, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
FITBONE Asset Acquisition
On February 3, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Wittenstein SE (“Wittenstein”), a privately-held German-based company, to acquire assets associated with the FITBONE intramedullary lengthening system for limb lengthening of the femur and tibia bones. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, as consideration for the acquired assets, we paid $18.0 million in cash consideration and entered into a Contract Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (“CMSA”) with Wittenstein. The acquisition was completed on March 26, 2020 and was treated as a business combination.
Neo Medical Investment and Convertible Loan
On October 1, 2020, we entered into a partnership with Neo Medical SA, a privately held Swiss-based medtech company (“Neo Medical”), that includes a co-development agreement covering the parties’ joint development of single use instruments for cervical spine procedures, and a distribution agreement under which Orthofix will exclusively distribute Neo Medical’s thoracolumbar procedure solutions to certain U.S. customer accounts.
Separately, we also purchased shares of Neo Medical’s preferred stock for consideration of $5.0 million and entered into a Convertible Loan Agreement, whereby we loaned CHF 4.6 million to Neo Medical (the “Convertible Loan”), which had a value of approximately $5.0 million at the date of issuance. The loan bears interest at 8.0%, with interest due semi-annually. The Convertible Loan matures in October 2024, provided that if a change in control of Neo Medical occurs prior to maturity, the Convertible Loan shall become immediately due upon such event. Both of these investments are recorded within other long-term assets.
The Convertible Loan may be convertible by either party into shares of Neo Medical’s preferred stock. The price per share at which the loan converts is dependent upon i) the party electing conversion and ii) Neo Medical’s price per share in its most recent fundraising activities at the time of conversion, as specified within the agreement.
Brazil
In September 2019, in relation to an ongoing legal dispute with a former Brazilian distributor, approximately $0.5 million (based upon foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020) of our cash in Brazil was frozen upon request to satisfy a judgment. Although we are appealing the judgment, this cash has been reclassified to restricted cash. For additional discussion regarding this matter, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Related Party Transaction
On February 2, 2021, we entered into a technology assignment and royalty agreement with a medical device technology company partially owned and controlled by the wife of President and Chief Executive Officer, Jon Serbousek, whereby we acquired the intellectual property rights to certain assets for consideration of up to $10.0 million. Consideration is comprised of $1.0 million, which was paid at signing, and $9.0 million in contingent consideration, dependent upon multiple milestones, such as receipt of 510(k) clearance or the attainment of certain net sales targets. In addition, we will pay a royalty of 2% to 4% on net sales, commencing upon commercialization of the acquired assets. The transaction was approved by our Audit and Finance Committee, with the Audit and Finance Committee directly supervising and directing the negotiation of the transaction by our employees who reported directly to the committee in connection with such negotiations. Mr. Serbousek was excluded from such discussions and did not participate in the negotiation or evaluation of the transaction. Mr. Serbousek is also being excluded from the administration and implementation of the agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, all discussions or disputes with the counterparty in connection with the agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby, or the administration or implementation thereof, oversight of our development and commercialization activities in relation to the acquired technology, and all other matters relating to the relationship between us and the counterparty.
Unremitted Foreign Earnings
Prior to the Domestication, as an entity incorporated in Curaçao, “foreign earnings” referred to both U.S. and non-U.S. earnings. As a result of the Domestication, only income sourced outside of the U.S. is considered unremitted foreign earnings. Unremitted foreign earnings increased from $49.2 million at December 31, 2019 to $53.7 million at December 31, 2020, due to currency translation. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, current year earnings have been deemed to be repatriated. Our investment in foreign subsidiaries continues to be indefinite in nature, however, we may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent that we do not incur significant additional tax liability.
Contractual Obligations
As a result of our operations, we are subject to certain contractual obligations with material cash requirements. Our material contractual obligations include, but are not limited to i) our contingent consideration arrangement associated with the Spinal Kinetics acquisition, ii) operating lease and finance lease obligations, and iii) uncertain tax positions.
For a description of our contingent consideration arrangements, lease obligations, and uncertain tax positions, refer to Notes 12, 9, and 20, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. In addition, we do not consider the backlog of firm orders to be material.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at that point in time. Actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates.
We believe the estimates described below are the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition
The process for recognizing revenue involves significant assumptions and judgments for certain of our revenue streams. Revenue recognition policies are “critical accounting estimates” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net sales, gross margin, operating income, EBITDA, and net income.
Bone Growth Therapies revenue is largely attributable to the U.S. and is comprised of third-party payor transactions and wholesale revenue.
For revenue derived from third-party payors, including commercial insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and governmental payors, such as Medicare, in connection with the sale of our stimulation products, we recognize revenue when the stimulation product is fitted to and accepted by the patient and all applicable documents that are required by the third-party payor have been obtained. Amounts paid by these third-party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates. These revenues are recorded at the expected or preauthorized reimbursement rates, net of any contractual allowances or adjustments. Certain billings are subject to review by the third-party payors and may be subject to adjustment.
Wholesale revenue is related to the sale of our bone growth stimulators directly to physicians and other healthcare providers. Wholesale revenues are recognized upon shipment and receipt of a confirming purchase order, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised goods.
Biologics revenue is largely attributable to the U.S. and is primarily related to a collaborative arrangement with MTF. We have exclusive global marketing rights and receive marketing fees from MTF based on products distributed by MTF. MTF is considered the principal in these arrangements; therefore, we recognize these marketing service fees on a net basis upon shipment of the product to the customer.
Spinal Implants and Global Extremities products are distributed world-wide, with U.S. sales largely comprised of commercial revenue and international sales derived from commercial sales and through stocking distributor arrangements.
Commercial revenue is largely related to the sale of our Spinal Implants and Global Extremities products to hospital customers. Commercial revenues are recognized when these products have been utilized and a confirming purchase order has been received from the hospital.
Stocking distributors purchase our products and then re-sell them directly to customers, such as hospitals. Revenue derived from stocking distributor arrangements is recognized upon shipment and receipt of a confirming purchase order, which is when the distributor obtains control of the promised goods. The transaction price is estimated based upon our historical collection experience with the stocking distributor. To derive this estimate, we analyze twelve months of historical invoices by stocking distributor and the subsequent collections on those invoices, for a period of up to 24 months subsequent to the invoice date. This percentage, which is specific to each stocking distributor, is then used to calculate the transaction price. Cost of sales is also recorded upon transfer of control of the product to the customer, which is when the Company’s performance obligation has been satisfied.
Allowance for Expected Credit Losses and Contractual Allowances
The process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments. The determination of the contractual life of accounts receivable, the aging of outstanding receivables, as well as the historical collections, write-offs, and payor reimbursement experience over the estimated contractual lives of such receivables, are integral parts of the estimation process related to reserves for expected credit losses and the establishment of contractual allowances. Accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for expected credit losses and contractual allowances. Revisions in allowances for expected credit loss estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses. Revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales. These estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience. In addition, we analyze our receivables by geography and by customer type, where appropriate, in developing estimates for expected credit losses.
We believe our allowance for credit losses is sufficient to cover customer credit risks; however, a 10% change in our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 would result in an increase or decrease to sales and marketing expense of $0.5 million. Additionally, we believe our estimate to establish contractual allowances is sufficient to cover customer credit risks; however, a 10% change in our reserve for contractual allowances as of December 31, 2020 would result in an increase or decrease to net sales of
$0.5 million. Our allowance for credit losses and estimation of contractual allowances are “critical accounting estimates” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net sales, gross margin, operating income, EBITDA, net income, and accounts receivable.
Inventory Allowances
Reserves for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and market value, and are based on assumptions and judgments about new product launch periods, overall product life cycles, forecasted demand, and market conditions. In the event of a decrease in demand for our products, excess product production, or a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence, we could be required to increase our inventory reserves, which would increase cost of sales and decrease gross profit. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs. If conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value or forecasted demand change, additional inventory adjustments in the future may be necessary. Our inventory allowance is a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, operating income, EBITDA, net income, and inventory.
Valuation of Intangible Assets
Our intangible assets are comprised primarily of patents, acquired or developed technology, in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, and licensing arrangements. We make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of intangible assets resulting from business combinations or asset acquisitions. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used for IPR&D activities are considered to have indefinite lives until the completion or abandonment of the associated project. Upon reaching the end of the relevant project, we will either amortize the acquired IPR&D over its estimated useful life or expense the acquired IPR&D should the project be unsuccessful with no future alternative use.
Significant judgment is required related to the forecasting of future operating results within our discounted cash flow valuation models to determine the valuation of intangible assets. Key assumptions include the anticipated useful lives of acquired intangibles, the projected cash flows associated with each intangible asset, the estimated probability of success for acquired IPR&D projects, and projected growth rates and discount rates. It is possible that significant changes in plans or assumptions may affect the recoverability of these assets and could potentially result in impairment. Our valuation of intangible assets is a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop these estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including operating income, EBITDA, net income, and intangible assets, net.
Goodwill
Our goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired from business combinations. The determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
We test goodwill at least annually for impairment, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. These indicators include, among others, significant declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or the development of a material adverse change in the business climate. Assessing goodwill impairment involves a high degree of judgment due to the estimates and assumptions used. We believe the estimates and assumptions involved in the impairment assessment to be critical because significant changes in such estimates and assumptions could materially affect key financial measures, including operating income, EBITDA, and net income.
In connection with our change in reporting segments, which occurred during the first quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill immediately prior to and subsequently following the change in reporting segments. The analysis did not result in an impairment. In addition, the net carrying value of goodwill that was previously reported under the prior reporting segments of (i) Bone Growth Therapies, (ii) Spinal Implants, and (iii) Biologics was consolidated and is now included within the Global Spine reporting segment.
In the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, we performed qualitative assessments for our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which did not result in any impairment charge. This qualitative analysis considered all relevant factors specific to the reporting units, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. As part of our qualitative assessment, we included quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment and concluded it more likely that not that an impairment hasn’t occurred.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The two most significant items that are or were recorded at fair value include (i) contingent consideration attributable to the Spinal Kinetics acquisition, (ii) our convertible loan agreement with Neo Medical and (iii) our eNeura debt security (prior to its restructuring and settlement in 2019).
The contingent consideration consists of potential future milestone payments of up to $60.0 million in cash associated with the Spinal Kinetics acquisition, which must be achieved within five years of the acquisition date to be paid. The milestone payments include (i) up to $15.0 million for meeting the FDA Milestone and (ii) revenue-based milestone payments of up to $45.0 million in connection with future sales of the M6-C artificial cervical disc and the M6-L artificial lumbar disc. The FDA milestone was achieved and paid in February of 2019.
Prior to its attainment in 2019, we estimated the fair value of the FDA Milestone using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. This fair value was based on significant inputs not observable in the market, with key assumptions including our estimation of the probability of FDA approval for the M6-C artificial cervical disc, the timing of approval, and the discount rate applied. Significant changes in these assumptions could have resulted in a significantly higher or lower fair value prior to obtaining FDA approval.
We estimate the fair value of the remaining potential future revenue-based milestone payments using a Monte Carlo simulation. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market, with key assumptions including the our forecasted future net sales of Motion Preservation products, discount rates applied, and assumptions for potential volatility of the forecasted revenue. Significant changes in these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value. Holding other inputs constant, an increase in our forecasted future revenues by 5% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration of $1.9 million, whereas a decrease in our forecasted future revenues by 5% would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration by $2.0 million.
We estimate the fair value of our convertible loan agreement with Neo Medical using Monte Carlo simulations, option-pricing models, and a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market, with significant unobservable inputs including applicable discount rates, implied volatility, the likelihood and projected timing of repayment or conversion, and projected cash flows in support of the estimated enterprise value of Neo Medical. Significant changes in these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value. Holding other inputs constant, an increase in the assumed cost of equity discount rate by 2% would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the convertible loan of $0.9 million, whereas a decrease the cost of equity discount rate by 2% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the convertible loan by $1.1 million.
Prior to its restructuring and settlement in 2019 for $4.0 million, the fair value of the eNeura debt security was based upon significant unobservable inputs, including the use of a discounted cash flows model, requiring us to develop our own assumptions. Some of the more significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the eNeura debt security were our estimates related to the timing and likelihood of conversion as a result of a change in control event, the timing and likelihood of repayment, and the applicable discount rate. Further, we were required to determine whether any decline in the fair value of the debt security below its basis was other-than-temporary, as the debt security was settled prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . In making this determination, we considered our intentions to hold or sell the security, whether it more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, and our best estimate of the amount that we ultimately expected to collect from the security. The estimated amount we expected to collect was based upon significant unobservable inputs, requiring us to develop our own assumptions.
Our fair value measurements are a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including operating income, EBITDA, and net income.
Litigation and Contingent Liabilities
From time to time, we are parties to or targets of lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, health and safety and employment and healthcare regulatory matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. These lawsuits, investigations or proceedings could involve a substantial number of
claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and customer base. Although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits, investigations or proceedings, we are self-insured for a significant portion of such liabilities.
We accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The assessments of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings, investigations and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, the involvement of the U.S. Government and its agencies in such proceedings, our experience in similar matters and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding, investigation or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings, investigations or claims progress. For matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate, or an investigation has not manifested itself in a filed civil or criminal complaint, (ii) the matters are in the early stages, (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties, and/or (iv) discussions with the government or other parties in matters that may be expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. In such instances, we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, fine, penalty or business impact, if any.
Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are recorded or revised. We believe our insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or our present insurance coverage. Litigation and contingent liabilities are “critical accounting estimates” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including operating income, EBITDA, and net income.
Tax Matters
We and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, effective tax rate, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Further, certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative, marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries. These intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates. The tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria, transfer pricing provisions, or other aspects of their respective tax laws, which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions.
We sometimes engage in transactions in which tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. We account for these uncertain tax positions in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, which requires significant judgment in assessing the estimated tax consequences of a transaction. We evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. We measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We re-evaluate our income tax positions periodically to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in or interpretations of tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision, which could have a material impact to the financial statements.
We establish a valuation allowance when measuring deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. This process requires significant judgment as we must project the current tax liability and estimate the deferred tax assets and liabilities into future periods, including net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider recent operating results, availability of taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income projections (exclusive of reversing temporary differences) and all prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
Tax matters are “critical accounting estimates” because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income.
Share-based compensation
We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of service-based stock options. The value is recognized as expense over the service period net of actual forfeitures. The expected term of options granted is estimated based on a number of factors, including the vesting and expiration terms of the award, historical employee exercise behavior for both options that are currently outstanding and options that have been exercised or are expired, the historical volatility of our common stock and an employee’s average length of service. The risk-free interest rate is determined based upon a constant U.S. Treasury security rate with a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the option award. We estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock.
We use the Monte Carlo valuation methodology to calculate the fair value of market-based stock options and stock units. The value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period and adjusted for forfeitures as they occur. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based options incorporates the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.
The fair value of performance-based restricted stock awards and stock units is calculated based upon the closing stock price at the date of grant. The value is recognized as expense over the derived requisite service period beginning in the period in which they are deemed probable to vest. Vesting probability is assessed based upon forecasted earnings and financial results and requires significant judgment.
Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock awards requires estimates and judgments. Our share-based compensation is a “critical accounting estimate” because changes in the assumptions used to develop estimates of fair value or the requisite service period could materially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, operating income, EBITDA, and net income.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by senior management in its financial and operational decision-making. We believe it is important to provide investors with the same non-GAAP metrics that senior management uses to supplement information regarding the performance and underlying trends of our business operations in order to facilitate comparisons to historical operating results and internally evaluate the effectiveness of our operating strategies. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of our underlying operating performance with other companies in the industry that also supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.
The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude items that reflect an economic cost that can have a material effect on cash flows. Similarly, certain non-cash expenses, such as equity compensation expense, do not directly impact cash flows, but are part of total compensation costs accounted for under GAAP.
Constant Currency
Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure, which is calculated by using foreign currency rates from the comparable, prior-year period, to present net sales at comparable rates. Constant currency can be presented for numerous GAAP measures, but is most commonly used by management to analyze net sales without the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.
EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income (expense), net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is the primary metric used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker in managing the business.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is an important indicator of how much cash is generated or used by our normal business operations, including capital expenditures. Management uses free cash flow as a measure of progress on its capital efficiency and cash flow initiatives.
