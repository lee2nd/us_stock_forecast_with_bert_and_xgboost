ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
The core consumer finance products we offer include Open-End, Unsecured Installment, Secured Installment and Single-Pay loans. Revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations includes: interest income, finance charges, CSO fees, late fees and non-sufficient funds fees. Product offerings differ by jurisdiction and are governed by the laws in each jurisdiction.
Open-End loans are a revolving line-of-credit with no defined loan term. We record revenue from Open-End loans on a simple-interest basis. Open-End revenues include interest income on outstanding revolving balances and other usage or maintenance fees as permitted by underlying statutes. Accrued interest and fees are included in "Gross loans receivable" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Installment loans are fixed-term, fully amortizing loans with a fixed payment amount due each period during the term of the loan. We record revenue from Installment loans on a simple-interest basis. Unsecured and Secured Installment revenue includes interest income from Company-Owned loans and loans originated by a bank in which we have a participating interest and are included in Unsecured Installment loans, CSO fees, and non-sufficient funds or returned-items fees on late or defaulted payments on past-due loans, known as late fees. Late fees comprise less than 1% of Installment revenues. Accrued interest and fees are included in "Gross loans receivable" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Single-Pay loans are generally unsecured short-term, small-denomination loans. We recognize revenues from Single-Pay loan products each period on a constant-yield basis ratably over the term of each loan. We defer recognition of unearned fees based on the remaining term of the loan at the end of each reporting period. Single-Pay revenues represent deferred presentment or other fees as defined by the underlying state, provincial or national regulations.
We also provide a number of ancillary financial products, including check cashing, proprietary general-purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards (Opt+), demand deposit accounts (Revolve Credit), money transfer services, credit protection insurance in the Canadian market and retail installment sales.
Provision for Losses
Credit losses are an inherent part of outstanding loans receivable. We maintain an allowance for loan losses for loans and interest receivable at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb such losses based primarily on our analysis of historical loss rates by products containing similar risk characteristics. The allowance for losses on our Company-Owned gross loans receivables reduces the outstanding gross loans receivables balance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability for
estimated incurred losses related to loans Guaranteed by the Company under CSO programs is reported in "Liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Increases in either the allowance or the liability, net of charge-offs and recoveries, are recorded as “Provision for losses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Cost of Providing Services
•Salaries and Benefits-include personnel-related costs for our store operations, including salaries, benefits and bonuses and are driven by the number of employees.
•Occupancy-includes rent expense for our leased facilities, as well as depreciation, maintenance, insurance, utility expense, and additional costs related to store cleaning protocols due to COVID-19 in 2020.
•Office-includes expenses primarily related to bank service charges and credit scoring charges at store locations.
•Other Costs of Providing Services-includes expenses related to operations such as processing fees, collections expense, security expense, taxes, repairs and professional fees incurred as part of store operations.
•Advertising-costs are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with attracting, retaining and/or reactivating customers as well as creating brand awareness. We have internal creative, web and print design capabilities and if we outsource these services, it is limited to mass-media production and placement. Advertising expense also includes costs for all marketing activities including paid search, advertising on social networking sites, affiliate programs, direct response television, radio air time and direct mail.
Operating Expense
•Corporate, District and Other Expenses-include costs such as salaries and benefits associated with our corporate and district-level employees, as well as other corporate-related costs such as rent, insurance, professional fees, utilities, travel and entertainment expenses and depreciation expense. Other income and expense includes the foreign currency impact to our intercompany balances, gains or losses on foreign currency exchanges and disposals of fixed assets and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts.
•Interest Expense-includes interest primarily related to our Senior Secured Notes, our Non-Recourse SPV facilities and our Senior Revolver.
Income or Loss from Equity Method Investments
We made our first investment in Katapult in 2017 as we identified multiple catalysts for future success, including an innovative e-commerce POS business model, a focus on the large and under-penetrated non-prime financing market, and a clear and compelling value proposition for merchants and consumers. To date, our cumulative cash investment in Katapult is $27.5 million. During the third quarter of 2020, we acquired additional equity interests in Katapult from certain existing owners. As a result of these acquisitions, a portion of our Katapult ownership will continue to be recognized under the equity method of accounting and a portion has been reclassified and will be measured at cost less impairment. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our share of Katapult's income or loss on a two-month lag with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the investment included in "Investments" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In December 2020, we announced that Katapult and FinServ entered into a definitive merger agreement that, when completed, will provide consideration to us in a combination of cash and stock. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2021 and remains subject to approval by stockholders of both companies and other customary closing conditions. The transaction will result in both a cash tax liability and deferred tax liability, with the cash tax liability dependent upon cash received at closing. For additional information, see Item 1, "Business-Company History and Overview" and Note 6, "Fair Value Measurements."
Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance
Revenue by Product
Year-over-year comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by factors related to COVID-19, such as lower consumer demand, increased or accelerated repayments and favorable payment trends as customers benefited from government stimulus programs at the start of the pandemic, our decision to tighten credit, favorable credit performance as a result of these factors and our approach to managing expenses (collectively, "COVID-19 Impacts"). Sequential loan growth, transaction volume and the related financial results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were impacted positively by normal seasonality and selectively returning credit scoring to pre-COVID-19 levels, together with continued historically low delinquencies and NCO rates.
Year-over-year comparisons exclude financial results of our former U.K. operations for all periods presented, as they were discontinued for accounting and reporting purposes in February 2019. See Note 22, "Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Full-year comparisons also were influenced by COVID-19 Impacts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue declined $294.4 million, or 25.8%, to $847.4 million, compared to the prior year. Geographically, U.S. and Canada revenues declined 30.1% and 8.5%, respectively. COVID-19 Impacts on year-over-year results for Canada were less than the U.S. due to the faster reopening of major markets and the continued popularity and growth of Open-End loans in Canada.
From a product perspective, Open-End revenues grew $4.2 million, or 1.7%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to $51.2 million, or 20.3%, of Open-End loan growth in Canada, partially offset by a $27.8 million, or 33.4%, loan balance decline in the U.S.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Unsecured Installment and Secured Installment revenues decreased 36.1% and 28.4%, respectively, because of COVID-19 Impacts, regulatory changes in California that became effective January 1, 2020 and regulatory changes for CSOs in Ohio that were effective May 1, 2019. Excluding California, Unsecured Installment and Secured Installment revenue decreased 32.0% and 18.9%, respectively.
Single-Pay revenue declined $71.0 million, or 37.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, primarily due to COVID-19 Impacts on loan volume and balances, which declined $37.7 million, or 46.2%. Single-Pay loan volumes were particularly affected by the broad reduction in storefront usage in both the U.S. and Canada by customers during periods of self-quarantine and stay-at-home orders, periodic closures of our stores for cleaning purposes, and increased pay-downs as a result of government stimulus programs.
Ancillary revenues, which include the sale of insurance products to Open-End and Installment loan customers in Canada, decreased $4.6 million, or 7.3%, versus the prior year, primarily stemming from lower check cashing fees.
The following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance" in Part II Item 7 of our 2019 Form 10-K.
Loan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis
The following table reconciles Company Owned gross loans receivable, a GAAP-basis balance sheet measure, to Gross combined loans receivable, a non-GAAP measure(1). Gross combined loans receivables includes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements but from which we earn revenue by providing a guarantee to the unaffiliated lender (in millions):
Gross combined loans receivable by product are presented below.
Gross combined loans receivable decreased $144.7 million, or 19.5%, to $597.8 million as of December 31, 2020, from $742.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by COVID-19 Impacts and, for Installment loans, the impact of regulatory changes in California that were effective January 1, 2020. Sequentially, gross combined loans receivable increased $60.6 million, or 11.3%, as demand increased during the fourth quarter from normal seasonality, reduced government stimulus benefits, continued growth in Open-End in Canada and growth in the Verge Credit brand. Gross combined loans receivable performance by product is described further in the following sections.
Open-End Loans
Open-End loan balances as of December 31, 2020 increased $23.4 million, or 7.0% ($16.4 million, or 4.9%, on a constant-currency basis), compared to December 31, 2019. Open-End balances in Canada increased $51.2 million, or 20.3% ($44.2 million, or 17.5%, on a constant-currency basis), year over year and $37.8 million, or 14.2% ($54.1 million, or 22.8%, on a constant currency basis), sequentially. Open-End loan balances in the U.S. declined $27.8 million, or 33.4% year over year. Sequentially, U.S. Open-End balances declined $1.2 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to the conversion of Virginia Open-End loans to Installment loans in advance of regulatory changes effective January 1, 2021.
The Open-End allowance coverage decreased sequentially from 16.0% to 14.5% as of December 31, 2020 and decreased from 16.4% year over year. The decrease was due to (i) sustained favorable trends in NCOs throughout 2020, (ii) the sequential decrease in TDRs loans as a percentage of total gross loans receivable, and (iii) continued lower past-due gross loans receivable as a percentage of total gross loans receivable compared to historical trends. Year over year, NCO rates improved 520 bps and past-due rates improved 440 bps.
Q1 2019 Open-End Loss Recognition Change
Effective January 1, 2019, we modified the timeframe over which we charge-off Open-End loans and made related refinements to our loss provisioning methodology. Prior to January 1, 2019, we deemed Open-End loans uncollectible and charged-off when a customer missed a scheduled payment and the loan was considered past-due. Because of our continuing shift to Open-End loans in Canada and our analysis of payment patterns on early-stage versus late-stage delinquencies, we revised our estimates and now consider Open-End loans uncollectible when the loan has been contractually past-due for 90 consecutive days. Consequently, past-due Open-End loans and related accrued interest now remain in loans receivable for 90 days before being charged off against the allowance for loan losses. All recoveries on charged-off loans are credited to the allowance for loan losses. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses compared to the related gross loans receivable balances that include accrued interest.
Prospectively from January 1, 2019, past-due, unpaid balances plus related accrued interest charge-off on day 91. This change was treated as a change in accounting estimate for accounting purposes and applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2019.
In addition, the following table illustrates, on a non-GAAP pro forma basis, the 2019 quarterly results as if the Q1 2019 Open-End Loss Recognition Change had been applied to our outstanding Open-End loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. This table is illustrative of retrospective application to determine the NCOs that would have been incurred in each quarter of 2019 from the December 31, 2018 loan book.
Unsecured Installment Loans - Company Owned
Company Owned Unsecured Installment revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and related gross loans receivable decreased $27.0 million, or 42.6%, and $58.4 million, or 36.3%, respectively, from the prior-year period. The decrease in receivables was primarily due to COVID-19 Impacts and regulatory changes in California that were effective January 1, 2020, partially offset by growth in the Verge Credit brand. Sequentially, Company Owned Unsecured Installment revenue and related gross loans receivable increased $5.2 million, or 16.7%, and $21.8 million, or 17.6%, respectively.
Unsecured Installment loans in California were $23.6 million, or 23.0%, of total Company Owned Unsecured Installment loans as of December 31, 2020, a decrease of $47.8 million from December 31, 2019. Sequentially, California Unsecured Installment loans decreased $3.8 million. Excluding California, Company Owned Unsecured Installment loans receivable decreased $10.6 million, or 11.8%, from the prior-year period, while revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2020 decreased $11.6 million, or 28.7%, compared to the prior-year period, due to COVID-19 Impacts. Sequentially, excluding California, Company Owned Unsecured Installment revenue and related loans receivable increased $7.2 million, or 33.5% and $21.2 million, or 36.8%, respectively, from September 30, 2020. The receivable increase was due to normal seasonality, reduced quarantine and stay-at-home orders and less government stimulus during the fourth quarter.
The Unsecured Installment quarterly NCO rate improved approximately 920 bps year-over-year, as a result of COVID-19 Impacts. Sequentially, the quarterly NCO rate increased from 11.5% in the third quarter to 12.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 on higher new customer origination mix and expansion into new states.
The Unsecured Installment allowance coverage increased year-over-year, from 22.1% as of December 31, 2019, to 23.5% as of December 31, 2020, as a result of certain loan modifications under the Customer Care Program, which were classified as TDRs. Loans classified as TDRs are included within Company Owned gross loans receivable. Amounts waived on these loans are immediately charged-off and the impairment for these loans is included within the Allowance for loan losses. Determination of the impairment for TDRs includes an estimate of their lifetime losses, which is greater than estimated incurred losses at a point in time. TDRs increased our total Unsecured Installment allowance coverage by nearly 100 bps from the allowance coverage that would have otherwise been required. Sequentially, the allowance coverage increased from 22.2% to 23.5%, as a result of moderately higher past-due balances from 21.1% to 23.6%, due largely to growth in new geographical markets, as well as the aforementioned increase in the NCO rate.
Unsecured Installment Loans - Guaranteed by the Company
Unsecured Installment loans Guaranteed by the Company declined $31.1 million year over year, primarily due to COVID-19 Impacts. Sequentially, Unsecured Installment loans Guaranteed by the Company increased $4.4 million, or 11.2%, due to normal seasonality, reduced quarantine and stay-at-home orders and less government stimulus during the fourth quarter.
NCO rates for Unsecured Installment loans Guaranteed by the Company increased year over year from 47.6% to 52.5%, and sequentially from 38.6% to 52.5%, as new customer volume improved and origination mix shifted online. The CSO liability for losses as a percentage of loans Guaranteed by the Company increased year over year from 14.2% to 16.6% as of
December 31, 2020 due primarily to an increased liability for certain loans modified under the Customer Care Program. Sequentially, past-due balances as a percent of gross loans receivable decreased from 15.3% to 14.1%. The CSO liability for losses increased from 15.8% to 16.6% during the three months ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the aforementioned increase in NCO rate.
Secured Installment Loans
Secured Installment revenue and the related gross combined loans receivable for the three months ended December 31, 2020 decreased 41.6% and 45.2%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period. The decreases were due to COVID-19 Impacts and regulatory changes in California that were effective January 1, 2020. California accounted for $13.7 million, or 27.6%, of total Secured Installment gross combined loans receivable as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $36.5 million, or 40.4%, as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $22.8 million, year over year. Excluding California, Secured Installment loans receivable decreased $18.0 million, or 33.5%, from the prior-year period, while revenues decreased $6.6 million, or 33.1%, year over year, due to COVID-19 Impacts.
The Secured Installment NCO rate improved 440 bps compared to the prior-year period. Secured Installment Allowance for loan losses and CSO liability for losses as a percentage of Secured Installment gross combined loans receivable increased from 11.5% as of December 31, 2019 to 14.4% as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the classification of certain loan modifications under the Customer Care Program as TDRs, partially offset by the impact of lower past-due receivables as of December 31, 2020. TDRs increased our total Secured Installment allowance coverage by 270 bps from the allowance coverage that would otherwise have been required. Despite the sequential increase in past-due Secured Installment gross combined loans receivable, the Secured Installment Allowance for loan losses and CSO liability for losses as a percentage of Secured Installment gross combined loans receivable remained flat at 14.4% due to sustained favorable trends in NCOs throughout 2020.
Single-Pay
Single-Pay revenue declined $22.4 million, or 44.9%, year over year, while related receivables declined $37.7 million, or 46.2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to COVID-19 Impacts. Single-Pay loan volume was particularly affected by the reduction in store traffic as customers self-quarantined and the increased loan repayments funded by government stimulus programs. Sequentially, Single-Pay revenues increased $2.4 million, or 9.5%, on related loan growth of $2.5 million, or 6.1%, due to normal seasonality and reduced quarantine and stay-at-home orders during the fourth quarter. The Single-Pay Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Single-Pay gross loans receivable, which was consistent year over year, decreased sequentially from 7.7% to 7.0% as of December 31, 2020, due to sustained favorable NCO trends throughout 2020.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The table below presents our consolidated results of operations. A further discussion of the results of our operating segments is provided under "-Segment Analysis" below.
(in thousands)
Comparison of Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue and Net Revenue
Revenue decreased $294.4 million, or 25.8%, to $847.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,141.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the declines in combined gross loans receivable discussed above. Year over year, U.S. decreased 30.1%, primarily from COVID-19 Impacts, and Canada decreased 8.5% (7.7% on a constant-currency basis). As previously mentioned, COVID-19 impacts on year-over-year results for Canada were less pronounced compared to the U.S. due to the faster reopening of Canadian markets and the continued growth of our Open-End loans in Canada.
Provision for losses decreased by $179.7 million, or 38.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The decrease in provision for loan losses was primarily due to lower loan volume and lower NCOs as a result of COVID-19 Impacts, as discussed in more detail in "-Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance-Loan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis" above and "-Segment Analysis" below.
Cost of Providing Services
Non-advertising costs of providing services decreased $35.6 million, or 14.7%, to $205.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $241.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Of the $35.6 million decrease, $15.5 million was related to third-party collection costs incurred in 2019 related to Ad Astra, which were included in Non-advertising costs of providing services prior to the acquisition of Ad Astra. Following the January 3, 2020 acquisition, we included Ad Astra operating costs within "Corporate, district and other expenses," consistent with the presentation of our other internal collection costs. The remaining decrease in Non-advertising costs of providing services was due to (i) lower underwriting and other variable costs as a result of lower demand, (ii) lower collection costs after governmental stimulus-related pay-downs and (iii) lower discretionary variable compensation.
Advertising costs decreased $8.8 million, or 16.6%, year over year because of COVID-19 Impacts.
Corporate, District and Other Expenses
Corporate, district and other expenses were $159.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Corporate, district and other expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 included $9.6 million of collection costs related to Ad Astra, which prior to our acquisition of it, were included in Non-advertising costs of providing services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, corporate, district and other expenses also included (i) $12.9 million of share-based compensation costs, (ii) $2.2 million of Canadian GST described in our reconciliation to Adjusted Net Income above and (iii) $5.7 million of legal and other costs described in our reconciliation to Adjusted Net Income above. For the year ended December 31, 2019, corporate district and other costs included (i) U.K.-related costs of $8.8 million, (ii) $10.3 million of share-based compensation and (iii) $4.8 million of legal and other costs as described in our reconciliation to Adjusted Net Income above. Share-based compensation costs increased primarily as a result of awards granted in the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding Ad Astra costs, share-based compensation expense and other costs described above, comparable corporate, district and other expenses decreased $6.6 million year over year, primarily due to the timing and extent of variable compensation and other cost reductions, including work-from-home initiatives to manage COVID-19 Impacts.
Equity Method Investment
Refer to the "-Katapult Update for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019" below for details.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.9 million, or 4.2%, on slightly higher year-over-year borrowings.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 7.3%. The effective income tax rate was lower compared to the federal and state/provincial statutory rates of approximately 26%, primarily as the result of discrete, one-time tax benefits related to usage of NOLs and other valuation allowance releases and the several non-taxable events during the fourth quarter of 2020.
First, given the CARES Act impact treatment of NOLs as described above, we recorded an income tax benefit of $11.3 million related to the carry-back of U.S. federal NOLs from tax years 2018 and 2019, which offsets our tax liability for years prior to tax reform and will generate a refund of previously paid taxes at a 35% statutory rate.
Second, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.6 million related to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against NOLs for certain entities in Canada. In addition, we released a valuation allowance of $1.1 million against the cumulative losses from our investment in Katapult, as we continued to record equity method income from this investment during the year.
The tax benefits described above were partially offset by an increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. of $1.1 million and the impact of the fourth quarter non-taxable events. Refer to the Reconciliation of Net Income from continuing operations to Adjusted Net Income in "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" for additional information.
The effective income tax rate of adjusted tax expense included in Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 25.3%.
Katapult Update for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
A portion of our investment in Katapult is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. We recognize our share of its income or loss on a two-month lag with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the investment included in "Investments" on the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2020, our recognized share of Katapult's earnings through October 31, 2020 was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with a loss of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
During the third quarter of 2020, we acquired additional equity interests in Katapult from certain existing owners for $11.2 million. As a result of these acquisitions, a portion of our Katapult ownership will continue to be recognized under the equity method of accounting and a portion has been reclassified and will be measured at cost less impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we purchased an additional equity interest in Katapult for $1.6 million.
In December 2020, we announced that Katapult and FinServ entered into a definitive merger agreement that, when completed, we expect will provide consideration to us in a combination of cash and stock. To date, our cumulative cash investment in Katapult is $27.5 million. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2021 and remains subject to approval by FinServ's stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The transaction will result in both a cash tax liability and deferred tax liability, with the cash tax liability dependent upon cash received at closing.
The table below presents select financial information for Katapult for the periods presented:
Comparison of Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Consolidated Results of Operations" in Part II Item 7 of our 2019 Form 10-K.
Segment Analysis
We report financial results for two reportable segments: the U.S. and Canada. Following is a summary of results of operations for the segment and period indicated (in thousands):
Comparison of U.S. Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
U.S. revenues decreased by $275.0 million, or 30.1%, to $638.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, as a result of decreases in combined gross loans receivable. Excluding the aforementioned impact of California Installment loan runoff, U.S. revenues decreased by $203.0 million, or 26.2%.
The provision for losses decreased $161.9 million, or 41.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of lower loan volume and lower NCOs. Year-over-year U.S. NCOs decreased $140.1 million, or 35.2%.
Non-advertising costs of providing services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $137.5 million, a decrease of $34.2 million, or 19.9%, compared to $171.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by Ad Astra costs of $15.5 million, which prior to its acquisition by us were included in Non-advertising costs of providing services. The remaining decrease year over year in Non-advertising costs of providing services was due to (i) lower underwriting and other variable costs as a result of lower demand, (ii) lower collection costs resulting from stimulus-related pay-downs and (iii) lower discretionary variable compensation.
Advertising costs decreased $6.0 million, or 12.9%, year over year because of COVID-19 Impacts.
Corporate, district and other expenses were $137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 0.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Corporate, district and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $9.6 million of collection costs related to Ad Astra, which were historically included in Non-advertising costs of providing services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, corporate, district and other costs included (i) $5.7 million of legal and other costs described in our reconciliation to Adjusted Net Income above and (ii) $12.9 million of share-based compensation costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, corporate, district and other expenses included (i) U.K. related costs of $8.8 million as described in our reconciliation to Adjusted Net Income above, (ii) $4.7 million of legal and other costs also described in our reconciliation to Adjusted Net Income above and (iii) share-based compensation costs of $10.3 million. Share-based compensation costs increased primarily as a result of awards granted in the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding these items, comparable corporate, district and other expenses decreased $5.4 million year over year, primarily due to the timing and extent of variable compensation and certain cost reductions, including work-from-home initiatives, to manage COVID-19 Impacts, partially offset by higher professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020.
As previously described, and given the two-month lag, we recorded equity income from our investment in Katapult of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
U.S. interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $4.1 million, or 6.9%, as a result of higher borrowings year-over-year, including the new Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility, which we closed in April 2020.
Comparison of U.S. Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018

Comparison of Canada Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Canada revenue decreased $19.4 million, or 8.5% ($17.5 million, or 7.7%, on a constant-currency basis), to $208.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $228.3 million in the prior year, due to COVID-19 Impacts.
Canada non-Single-Pay revenue increased $14.6 million, or 9.7% ($16.1 million, or 10.8%, on a constant-currency basis), to $164.4 million, compared to $149.8 million in the prior year, on growth of $45.6 million, or 17.1% ($38.5 million, or 14.4%, on a constant-currency basis), in related loan balances. The increase was driven by continued growth of Open-End loan despite COVID-19 Impacts. Ancillary revenue, which includes sales of insurance to Open-End loan customers, remained flat year over year due to increased insurance claims from consumers impacted by COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Single-Pay revenue decreased $34.0 million, or 43.3% ($33.6 million, or 42.8%, on a constant-currency basis), to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and Single-Pay receivables decreased $17.7 million, or 49.6% ($18.2 million, or 50.7% on a constant-currency basis), to $18.1 million from $35.8 million, in the prior year. The decreases in Single-Pay revenue and receivables were due to product mix shift from Single-Pay loans to Open-End loans, as well as significant declines in demand attributable to COVID-19 Impacts.
The provision for losses decreased $17.8 million, or 23.3% ($17.0 million, or 22.3%, on a constant-currency basis), to $58.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $76.4 million in the prior year. The decrease in provision for loan losses was primarily a result of lower NCOs and favorable loan performance as a result of COVID-19 Impacts as discussed previously. Year-over-year Canada NCOs decreased $26.2 million, or 32.5%.
Canada cost of providing services for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $72.1 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 5.4% ($3.4 million, or 4.5%, on a constant-currency basis), compared to $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to certain cost reductions to manage COVID-19 Impacts, as well as efficient and strategic advertising efforts through the course of 2020 to manage growth in Canada.
Canada operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $32.0 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 1.1%, as a result of certain cost reductions to manage COVID-19 Impacts, partially offset by costs related to year-over-year growth in Canada.

Currency Information
We operate in the U.S. and Canada and our consolidated results are reported in U.S. dollars.
Changes in our reported revenues and net income include the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. We translate all balance sheet accounts into U.S. dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of each period. We translate the statement of operations at the average rates of exchange for the period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders’ Equity.
Constant Currency Analysis
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 24.6% and 20.0%, respectively, of our revenues were originated in Canadian Dollars. As a result, changes in our reported results include the impacts of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates for the Canadian Dollar.
Income Statement
Balance Sheet - Exchange Rate as of December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following constant currency analysis removes the impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and utilizes constant currency results in our analysis of segment performance. Our constant currency assessment assumes foreign exchange rates in the current fiscal periods remained the same as in the prior fiscal periods. All conversion rates below are based on the U.S. Dollar equivalent to the Canadian Dollar. We believe that the constant currency assessment below is a useful measure in assessing the comparable growth and profitability of our operations.
We calculated the revenues and gross margin below for the year ended December 31, 2020 using the actual average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands).
We calculated the revenues and gross margin below for the year ended December 31, 2019 using the actual average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands).
We calculated gross loans receivable below as of December 31, 2020 using the actual exchange rate as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity to fund the loans we make are cash provided by operations; our Senior Revolver, Cash Money Revolving Credit Facility, Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility, Non-Recourse Canada SPV Facility, and funds from third-party lenders under our CSO programs. Additionally, in August 2018, we issued $690.0 million 8.25% Senior Secured Notes.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial ratios, covenants and other requirements in our debt agreements. We anticipate that our primary use of cash will be to fund growth in our working capital, finance capital expenditures, finance opportunistic acquisitions and meet our debt obligations. We may also use cash to fund a return of capital for our stockholders in the form of dividends, such as those in connection with our dividend program initiated in 2020, or through share repurchase programs, as we have in the past.
Our level of cash flow provided by operating activities typically experiences some seasonal fluctuation related to our levels of net income and changes in working capital levels, particularly loans receivable. Unexpected changes in our financial condition or other unforeseen factors may result in our inability to obtain third-party financing or could increase our borrowing costs in the future. We have the ability to adjust our volume of lending to consumers to the extent we experience any short-term or long-term funding shortfalls, such as tightening our credit approval practices (as we have done during the COVID-19 pandemic), which has the effect of reducing cash outflow requirements while increasing cash inflows through loan repayments.
We may also sell or securitize our assets, draw on our available revolving credit facility or line of credit, enter into additional refinancing agreements or reduce our capital spending to generate additional liquidity. Although consumer demand increased sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2020, our cash on hand and total liquidity remains at elevated levels due to a combination of factors, including (i) a sustained decrease in demand since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) increased or accelerated repayments as customers benefited from government stimulus programs, (iii) favorable credit performance, and (iv) the runoff of California Installment loans following regulatory changes effective January 1, 2020. These factors resulted in our available cash on hand of $213.3 million and our total liquidity of $310.7 million as of December 31, 2020. We believe our cash on hand and available borrowings provide us with sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months.
As previously described, our investment in Katapult and acquisition of Flexiti, when closed, may materially impact our future cash flow and cash and cash equivalents. For additional information, refer to "Item 1 - Business-Company Overview." We have no material commitments or demands that are likely to affect our liquidity other than these transactions.
Borrowings
Our debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020, net of deferred financing costs (in thousands):
Refer to Note 7, "Debt," for details on each of our credit facilities and resources.
Cash Flows
The following highlights our cash flow activity and the sources and uses of funding during the periods indicated:
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
As previously described, year-over-year comparisons were impacted by COVID-19 Impacts and the runoff of California Installment loans from regulatory changes effective January 1, 2020.
Continuing Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $403.5 million, primarily attributable to net income from continuing operations of $74.4 million, the effect of non-cash reconciling items of $330.4 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million. Our non-cash reconciling items of $330.4 million included (i) provision for loan losses of $288.8 million, (ii) changes in deferred income tax of $11.7 million, (iii) share-based compensation of $12.9 million and (iv) $17.5 million of depreciation and amortization. Our changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million related to a higher income tax receivable of $20.6 million and a higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities balance of $11.9 million, partially offset by a $23.7 million decline in accrued interest on our gross loans receivable due to overall volume decline, as previously discussed.
Continuing Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $255.1 million, primarily reflecting (i) the net origination of loans of $217.0 million, (ii) the acquisition of Ad Astra for $14.4 million, net of cash received, and (iii) $12.8 million of additional equity interests in Katapult. In addition, we used cash to purchase $10.9 million of property, equipment and software.
Continuing Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.3 million, primarily due to $49.5 million of proceeds on our Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility, partially offset by a net pay-down on our Non-Recourse Canada SPV Facility of $19.0 million, common stock repurchases of $5.9 million, cash dividends of $9.1 million and debt issuance costs of $7.0 million related to the Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility.
Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018

Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We originate loans in all of our store locations and online, except for our operations in Texas and, prior to May 2019, Ohio. In these states, we operate as a CSO. Refer to "Critical Accounting Practices and Estimates-Credit Services Organization" below for further information on our CSO/CAB relationships and "Item 1. Business-Regulatory Environment and Compliance" for further information on developments in Ohio.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the incremental maximum amount payable under all such guarantees was $36.6 million and $62.7 million, respectively. This liability is not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. If we are required to pay any portion of the total amount of the loans we have guaranteed, we will attempt to recover some or the entire amount from the customers. We hold no collateral in respect of the guarantees. We estimate a liability for losses associated with the guaranty provided to the CSO lenders using assumptions and methodologies similar to the allowance for loan losses, which we recognize for our consumer loans. The liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans was $7.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $10.6 million at December 31, 2019, which we include as "Liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical in understanding our historical and future performance and require management's most subjective and complex judgments.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Credit losses are an inherent part of outstanding loans receivable. We maintain an allowance for loan losses for loans and interest receivable at a level we estimate to be adequate to absorb incurred losses based primarily on our analysis of historical loss or charge-off rates by products containing similar risk characteristics. The allowance for losses on our Company Owned gross loans receivables reduces the outstanding gross loans receivables balance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We report the liability for losses related to loans Guaranteed by the Company under CSO programs in “Liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record increases in either the allowance or the liability, net of charge-offs and recoveries, as “Provision for losses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We also consider delinquency trends as well as macro-economic conditions we believe may affect portfolio losses. If a loan is deemed to be uncollectible before it is fully reserved based on information we become aware of (e.g., receipt of customer bankruptcy notice or death), we charge off such loan at that time. Qualitative factors such as the impact of new loan products, changes to underwriting criteria or lending policies, new store development or entrance into new markets, changes in jurisdictional regulations or laws, recent credit trends and general economic conditions impact management’s judgment on the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any recoveries on loans previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance when collected.
Goodwill
We exercise judgment in evaluating assets for impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or when circumstances arise which could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These tests require comparing carrying values to estimated fair values of the reporting unit under review.
The U.S. and Canada operations are our two reporting units, as defined by FASB’s ASC 280, Segment Reporting, for which we assess goodwill for impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a quantitative assessment for the U.S. and Canada reporting units as of October 1, 2020. As further described in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations, an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. Events or circumstances that could indicate an impairment include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or economic outlook. Fair value of each reporting unit is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and Canada as a result of COVID-19, which could impact both reporting units. Changes in the expected length of the current economic downturn, timing of recovery, or long-term revenue growth or profitability for these reporting units could increase the likelihood of a future goodwill impairment. Additionally, changes in market participant assumptions such as an increased discount rate or further share price reductions could increase the likelihood of a future impairment. These and other macroeconomic factors were considered when performing the annual test as of October 1, 2020.
Based upon the quantitative assessment as of October 1, 2020, management concluded both reporting units' estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value. As a result, we did not record impairment losses on goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes the segment allocation of recorded goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods indicated:
Credit Services Organization
Through our CSO programs, we act as a CSO/CAB on behalf of customers in accordance with applicable state laws. We currently offer loans through CSO programs in stores and online in the state of Texas. Prior to May 2019, we operated as a CSO in Ohio. See Item 1. “Business-Regulatory Environment and Compliance” for additional details.
As described above in "-Allowance for Loan Losses," we estimate a liability for losses associated with the guaranty provided to the CSO lenders using assumptions and methodologies similar to the allowance for loan losses, which we recognize for our consumer loans. The liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans was $7.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $10.6 million at December 31, 2019, which we include as "Liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We calculate CSO fees based on the amount of the customer’s outstanding loan and in accordance with the applicable jurisdiction’s laws. For services we provide under our CSO programs, we receive payments from customers on their scheduled loan repayment due dates. The CSO fee is earned ratably over the term of the loan as the customers make payments. If a loan is paid off early, no additional CSO fees are due or collected. The maximum CSO loan term is 180 days in Texas. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 60.7% and 58.2%, respectively, of Unsecured Installment loans, and 59.1% and 54.3%, respectively, of Secured Installment loans originated under CSO programs were paid off prior to the original maturity date.
Since CSO loans are made by a third-party lender, we do not include them in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as loans receivable; instead, we include them in “Prepaid expense and other” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We receive payments from customers for these fees on their scheduled loan repayment due dates.
