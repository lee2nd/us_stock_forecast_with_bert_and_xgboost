ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section includes a discussion of our operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020. The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
For discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2019 including comparison to fiscal 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020.
Business
Founded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. is one of North America’s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. As a vertically integrated organization, we offer a range of products and services to meet global demand through our network that includes 50 retail self-service auto parts stores, 52 metals recycling facilities, and an electric arc furnace (“EAF”) steel mill.
Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our internal organizational and reporting structure included two operating and reportable segments: the Auto and Metals Recycling (“AMR”) business and the Cascade Steel and Scrap (“CSS”) business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, in accordance with our plan announced in April 2020, we completed the transition to a new internal organizational and reporting structure reflecting a functionally-based, integrated model (“One Schnitzer”), supporting a single segment. We consolidated our operations, sales, services, and other functional capabilities at an enterprise level reflecting enhanced focus by management on optimizing our vertically integrated value chain. This change in structure has resulted in a more agile organization and solidified achievement of recent productivity improvements and cost efficiency initiatives. We began reporting on this new single-segment structure in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
We sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in both foreign and domestic markets. We also sell a range of finished steel long products produced at our steel mill. Our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials, including end-of-life vehicles, available to be processed at our facilities. Our results of operations also depend substantially on our operating leverage from processing and selling higher volumes of recycled metal as well as our ability to efficiently extract ferrous and nonferrous metals from the shredding process. We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating results. We believe we generally benefit from sustained periods of stable or rising recycled metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating results and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled metal selling prices decline, either sharply or for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress. With respect to finished steel products produced at our steel mill, our results of operations are impacted by demand and prices for these products, which are sold to customers located primarily in the Western U.S. and Western Canada.
Our quarterly operating results fluctuate based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in market conditions for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal and finished steel products, the supply of scrap metal in our domestic markets, and varying demand for used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Certain of these factors are influenced, to a degree, by the impact of seasonal changes including severe weather conditions, which can impact the timing of shipments and inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal collection and production levels at our facilities, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Further, sanctions, trade actions, and licensing and inspection requirements can impact the level of profitability on sales of our products and, in certain cases, impede or restrict our ability to sell to certain export markets or require us to direct our sales to alternative market destinations, which can cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

Strategic Priorities
As we continue to closely monitor economic conditions, we remain focused on the following core strategies and plans to meet our business goals and objectives:
•
Long-term expansion of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal supply and processing, sales volumes, and operating margins;
•
Technology investments and process improvements to increase the separation and recovery of metal materials from our shredding process and to expand product optionality;
•
Development of new products and expansion of recycling services and capabilities to reach a broader market, enhance customer value, and increase operating margins;
•
Increase market share through initiatives to maximize volumes and through selective partnerships, alliances, and acquisitions;
•
Productivity and continuous improvement initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees, increase operating efficiency and effectiveness, advance sustainable business practices, improve natural resource stewardship, and reduce operating expense;
•
Use of our seven deepwater ports and ground-based logistics network to directly access customers domestically and internationally to meet demand for our products wherever it is greatest; and
•
Further optimization of our integrated recycling and steel manufacturing operating platforms to maximize opportunities for synergies, cost efficiencies, and volumes.
Key economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate
We sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel. Our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the U.S. and Western Canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the Western U.S. and Western Canada. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the economic cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. Global economic conditions, including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed below in this section, structural and cyclical changes in supply and demand conditions, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the availability and price of raw material alternatives, and trade actions such as tariffs affect market prices for and sales volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and steel products in the Western U.S. and Western Canada and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for our reportable segments.
In fiscal 2021, market conditions for recycled metals improved globally, with selling prices for many recycled metal commodities reaching multi-year highs during the fiscal year. Selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products increased significantly compared to the prior fiscal year which was negatively impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2021, the average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products increased by 61% and 60%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year. The deterioration in global economic conditions that occurred in fiscal 2020 in large part due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic reflected among other things the curtailment of many commercial and government-sponsored activities using steel and other metal materials, causing metal commodity prices to decrease sharply and widespread destocking of inventories. As global economies revived and commercial and investment activities resumed, including throughout fiscal 2021, demand for recycled metals and finished steel increased substantially, which contributed to periods of sharp increases in market selling prices for these products. Increased focus on decarbonization strategies by governments and businesses around the world, including investments in infrastructure and technologies that minimize carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels, among other factors, also contributed to strong demand for most of our products in fiscal 2021 and support global long-term demand for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal. In fiscal 2021, we observed a trend of increased use of recycled metals to manufacture new products, including greater use of EAF technology for steel production which uses recycled metal as a primary raw material. Average selling prices for our finished steel products, which are produced in our steel mill using EAF technology, increased by 17% compared to the prior fiscal year.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)
We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business. The COVID-19 outbreak, which the World Health Organization characterized as a pandemic in March 2020, has resulted in governments around the world implementing measures with various levels of stringency to help control the spread of the virus as well as vaccination programs to build levels of immunity among the population. In addition, governments and central banks globally have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19. We are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders to date, we have continued to operate across our footprint throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the health and safety of our employees, and all who visit our sites, is our top priority, and we are following all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health department guidelines. Further, we implemented infection control measures at all our sites and put in place travel and in-person meeting restrictions and other physical distancing measures. Following the onset of COVID-19 and its negative effects on our business, most prominently reflected in our third quarter fiscal 2020 results, global economic conditions improved during fiscal 2021, resulting in increased demand for our products, which led to our earnings for our fiscal 2021 substantially exceeding the results for our fiscal 2020. Beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on individual, business, and government activities. The easing of restrictions and the existence of variant strains of COVID-19 may lead to a rise in infections, which could result in the reinstatement of some of the restrictions previously in place and the implementation of new restrictions and mandates, and there are ongoing global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from the pandemic including labor shortages, logistical challenges such as increased port congestion, and increases in costs for certain goods and services. While the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Steel Mill Fire
On May 22, 2021, we experienced a fire at our steel mill in McMinnville, Oregon. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the mill’s melt shop, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to other buildings or equipment. The rolling mill production ceased in early June 2021. In August 2021, our steel mill began ramping up production ahead of the original schedule following the substantial completion of replacement and repairs of property and equipment in the melt shop that had been lost or damaged by the fire. This production ramp-up was initiated with a full workforce and included acceptance of orders for our complete range of finished steel products based on the rolling schedule. Impacts are expected to continue during the ramp-up phase and may continue thereafter. We have insurance that we believe is fully applicable to the losses and have filed initial insurance claims, which are subject to deductibles and various conditions, exclusions, and limits, for the property damage and business income losses resulting from the matter. The property damage deductible under the policies insuring the Company’s assets is $1 million, while the deductible for lost business income is 10 times the Average Daily Gross Earnings which would have been earned had no interruption occurred, calculated subject to judgments and uncertainties. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we recognized an initial $10 million insurance receivable and related insurance recovery gain, reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively, partially offsetting the detrimental effects of the incident primarily to our fourth quarter operating results. We incurred approximately $10 million in capital purchases in the fourth quarter to replace and repair property and equipment that had been lost or damaged by the fire. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022 through the date of this report, we received advance payments from insurance carriers totaling approximately $30 million towards our claims, and not reflecting any final or full settlement of claims with the carriers. The insurance claims resolution process may extend significantly beyond completion of repair and replacement of the physical plant property that experienced physical loss or damage at the melt shop and the restart of production activities.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this management’s discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance, liquidity, and capital structure which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures adds a meaningful presentation of our operating and financial performance, liquidity, and capital structure. For example, following the modification of our internal organizational and reporting structure completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we use adjusted EBITDA as one of the measures to compare and evaluate financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of our net income before results from discontinued operations, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, charges for legacy environmental matters (net of recoveries), business development costs not related to ongoing operations including pre-acquisition expenses, restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, charges related to non-ordinary course legal settlements, asset impairment charges, net and other items which are not related to underlying business operational performance. See the reconciliations of supplemental financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.
36 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2021
SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
Our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Although we find these non-GAAP financial measures useful in evaluating the performance of our business, our reliance on these measures is limited because they often materially differ from our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, we typically use these adjusted amounts in conjunction with our GAAP results to address these limitations. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

Market conditions for recycled metals improved in fiscal 2021, with selling prices for many recycled metal commodities reaching multi-year highs during the year. Average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products increased significantly compared to the prior fiscal year which was negatively impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2021, the average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products increased by 61% and 60%, respectively, and sales volumes for these products increased by 11% and 8%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year. Market conditions for our finished steel products also improved in fiscal 2021, which contributed to finished steel average selling prices increasing by 17% compared to the prior fiscal year, the benefits of which were partially offset by the impact of lower finished steel sales volumes due to a business interruption at our steel mill caused by a fire in May 2021. Our results in fiscal 2021 reflected substantial benefits from the higher price environment for most of our products including a significant expansion in our ferrous metal spreads, increased ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes supported by strong demand and improved supply flows, greater contributions from sales of nonferrous products, and a favorable impact from average inventory accounting, compared to the prior fiscal year.

Revenues
Revenues in fiscal 2021 increased by 61% compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to significantly higher average net selling prices and increased sales volumes for our ferrous and nonferrous products in both export and domestic markets. The increase was driven by stronger market conditions for recycled metals globally, with selling prices for many recycled metal commodities reaching multi-year highs during fiscal 2021. The average net selling price for our ferrous products increased by 61%, and the average net selling price for our nonferrous products increased by 60%, compared to the prior fiscal year. Ferrous sales volumes increased by 11% and nonferrous sales volumes increased by 8%, compared to the prior fiscal year. Market conditions for our finished steel products also improved in fiscal 2021, which contributed to higher finished steel average selling prices, reflecting robust demand in West Coast construction markets. The impact of higher average selling prices for our finished steel products on steel revenues in fiscal 2021 reduced the impact on our financial performance of lower sales volumes and rolling mill utilization compared to the prior fiscal year, which were primarily due to the May 2021 fire and related production interruption at our steel mill.
Operating Performance
Net income in fiscal 2021 was $170 million, compared to net loss of $2 million in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2021 was $289 million, compared to $85 million in the prior fiscal year. The improvement in our results for fiscal 2021 reflected substantial benefits from the higher price environment for most of our products, including a significant expansion in our ferrous metal spreads, increased ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes supported by strong demand and improved supply flows, greater contributions from sales of nonferrous products, and a favorable impact from average inventory accounting, compared to the prior fiscal year. Ferrous metal spreads in fiscal 2021 increased by approximately 44% and average net selling prices for our nonferrous joint products that are recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, increased by approximately 58% compared to the prior fiscal year. Our results in fiscal 2021 also reflected substantially increased contributions from sales of higher priced PGM products compared to the prior fiscal year and achievement of the full run rate of benefits from productivity initiatives implemented throughout fiscal 2020. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we recognized initial insurance recoveries of $10 million related to the May 2021 fire at our steel mill, partially offsetting the detrimental effects of the incident primarily to our fourth quarter operating results. In comparison, our results in fiscal 2020 reflected periods of sharply declining commodity prices and constrained supply of scrap metal, especially during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 due in large part to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant negative impact on operating margins and overall operating results for fiscal 2020. Selling, general, and administrative expense in fiscal 2021 increased by 29% compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses as a result of higher incentive compensation accruals driven by improved business performance, increased charges related to legacy environmental matters, and increased legal and professional services costs. See the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.
In fiscal 2020, we implemented productivity initiatives aimed at reducing our annual operating expenses, mainly through reductions in non-trade procurement spend, including outside and professional services, lower employee-related expenses, and other non-headcount measures. We targeted $20 million in annual benefits from these initiatives, and we achieved the full quarterly run rate of benefits in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We achieved approximately $19 million and $18 million in realized benefits in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, in April 2020, we announced our intention to modify our internal organizational and reporting structure to the One Schnitzer functionally-based, integrated model, which we completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This change in structure has resulted in a more agile organization and solidified achievement of recent productivity improvements and cost efficiency initiatives. During fiscal 2020, we incurred severance costs of $2 million, exit-related costs associated with a lease contract termination of $1 million, and professional services costs related to these initiatives of $6 million.
Income Taxes
39 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2021
SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 was an expense on pre-tax income of 18.2%, compared to an expense on pre-tax loss of 8.6% for fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the benefit from the foreign derived intangible income deduction in fiscal 2021 and the impacts of research and development credits, release of the valuation allowance against Puerto Rico deferred tax assets, and other discrete items. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, and reflective of income tax expense on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations, primarily due to the partially offsetting impacts of individually immaterial permanent differences from non-deductible expenses and research and development credits, the effects of unrecognized tax benefits, and the aggregate impact of state taxes.
We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets related to certain jurisdictions as a result of negative objective evidence, including the effects of historical losses in these tax jurisdictions, outweighing positive objective and subjective evidence, indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the associated tax jurisdictions in future years to benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from the utilization of net operating losses. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets. Changes in historical earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause us to adjust our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations in the period we determine that these factors have changed.
CARES Act
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted into law. The CARES Act contains several income tax provisions, as well as other measures, aimed at assisting businesses impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act removes certain limitations on utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”) and allows for carrybacks of certain past and future NOLs. We applied the NOL carryback provisions of the CARES Act to our NOL for fiscal 2020, which resulted in the reclassification of a $11 million NOL deferred income tax asset to refundable income taxes and recognition of a $1 million income tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We do not anticipate the other income tax provisions of the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial statements.
See Note 14 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We rely on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity, supplemented by current cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.
Sources and Uses of Cash
We had cash balances of $28 million and $18 million as of each August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash balances are intended to be used primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions. We use excess cash on hand to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. As of August 31, 2021, debt was $75 million, compared to $104 million as of August 31, 2020, and debt, net of cash, was $47 million as of August 31, 2021 compared to $87 million as of August 31, 2020 (see the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7).
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 was $190 million, compared to $125 million in fiscal 2020.
Sources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2021 included a $65 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to higher raw material purchase prices and the timing of payments, a $28 million increase in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to increased incentive compensation liabilities, and a $23 million increase in income tax accruals. Uses of cash in fiscal 2021 included a $89 million increase in inventories due to higher raw material purchase prices, higher volumes on hand, and the timing of purchases and sales, and a $84 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increases in selling prices and higher sales volumes for recycled metals, as well as the timing of sales and collections.
40 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2021
SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
Sources of cash in fiscal 2020 included a $39 million decrease in inventories due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of purchases and sales and a $13 million increase in accrued payroll and related liabilities due to increased incentive compensation liabilities and deferred payroll taxes as permitted under the CARES Act. Uses of cash in fiscal 2020 included an $8 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to lower raw material purchase prices and the timing of payments.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 was $118 million, compared to $79 million in fiscal 2020.
Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 included capital expenditures of $119 million to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for investments in advanced metals recovery technology and environmental and safety-related assets, as well as $8 million related to the repair and replacement of damaged steel mill equipment, compared to $82 million in the prior year.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2021 was $63 million, compared to $41 million in fiscal 2020.
Cash flows from financing activities in fiscal 2021 included $31 million in net repayments of debt, compared to $8 million in the prior fiscal year (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7). Uses of cash in both of fiscal 2021 and 2020 also included $21 million for the payment of dividends.
Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we borrowed an incremental $250 million under our credit facilities in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. We repaid the $250 million of additional borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
Debt
Following is a summary of our outstanding balances and availability on credit facilities and long-term debt, exclusive of finance lease obligations (in thousands):
(1)
Remaining availability is net of $8 million of outstanding stand-by letters of credit as of August 31, 2021.
Our senior secured revolving credit facilities, which provide for revolving loans of $700 million and C$15 million, mature in August 2023 pursuant to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The $700 million credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $50 million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings. Interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement are based, at our option, on either the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (or the Canadian equivalent for C$ loans), plus a spread of between 1.25% and 3.50%, with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated funded debt to EBITDA (as defined by the credit agreement), or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.75%, in each case, plus a spread of between 0.00% and 2.50% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between 0.20% and 0.50% based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated funded debt to EBITDA.
We had borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities of $60 million and $90 million as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 1.75% and 4.59% as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
We use the credit facilities to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions. Our credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default, and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates, and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. As of August 31, 2021, the financial covenants under the credit agreement included (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges, and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness.
As of August 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.50 to 1.00 and was 7.20 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2021. The consolidated leverage ratio was required to be no more than 0.55 to 1.00 and was 0.09 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2021.
Our obligations under our credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of our and our subsidiaries’ assets, including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable.
While we currently expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement, we may not be able to do so in the event market conditions, COVID-19, or other negative factors have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. If we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the agreement. In such case, we would be required to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain alternative funds. We cannot assure that any such alternative funds, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.
Other debt obligations, which totaled $8 million and $7 million as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily relate to an equipment purchase, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligation is treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and continue for a period of four years thereafter.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures totaled $119 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $82 million for fiscal 2020. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 included approximately $51 million for investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technologies, support for volume initiatives, and other growth projects, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities. We currently plan to invest in the range of $130 million to $160 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2022, including for investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technologies and to support volume initiatives as well as post-acquisition and other growth projects, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to some delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, and to the time required to obtain permits from government agencies, resulting in the deferral of certain capital expenditures. Given the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors impacting the timing of project completion, the extent to which forecasted capital expenditures could be deferred is uncertain.
Environmental Compliance
Building on our commitment to recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, we continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate. As part of our capital expenditures discussed in the prior paragraph, we invested approximately $21 million in capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal 2021, and we currently plan to invest in the range of $30 million to $40 million for such projects in fiscal 2022. These projects include investments in equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations and storm water systems.

We have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as one of the potentially responsible parties that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (the “Site”). See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of this matter, as well as other legacy environmental loss contingencies. We believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation, and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with the Site, although there are no assurances that those policies will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to the Site could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions and could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and could adversely impact our liquidity.
Dividends
On June 30, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 of $0.1875 per common share, which equates to an annual cash dividend of $0.75 per common share. Dividends of $0.75 per common share, totaling $21 million, were declared and paid during fiscal 2021.
On July 31, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of $0.1875 per common share, which equated to an annual cash dividend of $0.75 per common share. Dividends of $0.75 per common share, totaling $21 million, were declared and paid during fiscal 2020.
Share Repurchase Program
Pursuant to our share repurchase program as amended in 2001, 2006, and 2008, we were authorized to repurchase up to nine million shares of our Class A common stock. As of August 31, 2021, we had authorization to repurchase up to a remaining 706 thousand shares of our Class A common stock when we deem such repurchases to be appropriate. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as to optimize our capital structure and to offset dilution related to share-based compensation arrangements. We consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of funding, our future business plans, and the market price of our stock. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal 2021.
Assessment of Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our available cash resources, internally generated funds, credit facilities, and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and other financing needs.
We generally believe our current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities, and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity needs for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions, joint ventures, debt service requirements, environmental obligations, and other contingencies. However, in the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurances that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.
On October 1, 2021, during the first quarter of our fiscal 2022, we closed a transaction under a definitive agreement with Columbus Recycling entered on August 12, 2021, to acquire eight metals recycling facilities. The cash purchase price was approximately $107 million, subject to adjustment for acquired net working capital relative to an agreed-upon benchmark, as well as other adjustments. We funded the business acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. See “Acquisition of Columbus Recycling” in Note 18 - Subsequent Events in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail.

Contractual Obligations
We have certain contractual obligations to make future payments. The following table summarizes future obligations related to debt and leases as of August 31, 2021 (in thousands):
(1)
Credit facilities include the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under bank secured revolving credit facilities, which mature in August 2023.
(2)
Interest payments on credit facilities are based on interest rates in effect as of August 31, 2021. As contractual interest rates and the amount of debt outstanding is variable in certain cases, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided.
(3)
Other debt obligations primarily relate to an equipment purchase, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligation is treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and continue for a period of four years thereafter.
(4)
Operating lease payments reflect those embedded in the measurement of our operating lease liabilities and, thus, include future lease payments for the remaining non-cancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by renewal (or termination) options which we are reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise). These operating lease payments do not include certain tax, insurance, and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. Also, we have excluded future minimum lease payments for leases that have been executed but have not commenced as of August 31, 2021.
In addition to future obligations related to debt and leases presented in the table above, we have certain material cash requirements, including but not limited to commitments for capital expenditures. See “Capital Expenditures” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above in this Item 7 for discussion of our planned investment in capital expenditures in fiscal 2022, a portion of which represents contractual commitments that existed as of the end of our fiscal 2021. We also had open purchase orders as of August 31, 2021 for purchases of primarily fuels and lubricants, machinery and equipment components and parts, and consumables used in our operations of approximately $60 million, nearly all of which require payment of cash in our fiscal 2022.
See Note 12 - Employee Benefits in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure related to qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, which include a defined benefit pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement benefit plan, multiemployer pension plans, defined contribution plans, and a deferred compensation plan.
We maintain stand-by letters of credit to provide support for certain obligations, including workers’ compensation and performance bonds. At August 31, 2021, we had $8 million outstanding under these arrangements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. An accounting estimate is deemed to be critical if it is made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
Our critical accounting estimates include those related to inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, environmental costs, and income taxes.

Inventories
Our inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of our inventory. As we generally sell our recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders.
The accounting process we use to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, we rely on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content, and the source of the unprocessed metal. The Company’s estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of our scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, we further adjust our ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.
Long-Lived Assets
We test long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. We test our asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group. Determination of fair value is considered a critical accounting estimate. In fiscal 2021, we did not identify any triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of a material asset group may be impaired.
Goodwill
We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”).
When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
45 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2021
SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) determined separately for the reporting unit. To estimate the present value of the cash flows that extend beyond the final year in the discounted cash flow analysis, we employ a terminal value technique, whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures, adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the analysis, and then discount these estimated cash flows by the WACC to establish the terminal value.
The determination of fair value using the income approach requires judgment and involves the use of estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate (WACC), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants.
We also use a market approach based on earnings multiple data and our Company’s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting units’ valuations. We reconcile the Company’s market capitalization to the aggregated estimated fair value of all reporting units, including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest in the Company.
As a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming the estimates described above, actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to future revenue and operating margin growth, WACC and other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of the reporting units’ fair value. Although we believe the assumptions used in testing our reporting units’ goodwill for impairment are reasonable, a lack of recovery or further deterioration in market conditions from current levels, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for the reporting unit with allocated goodwill, a decline in our share price from current levels for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the WACC, among other factors, could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2021. As of the testing date, the balance of our goodwill was $171 million, and all but $1 million of such balance was carried by two reporting units. We elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances led to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit carrying goodwill is less than its carrying amount. As a result of the qualitative assessment, we concluded that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit carrying goodwill is less than its carrying value as of the testing date, and, therefore, no further impairment testing was required.
Environmental Costs
We operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants. Environmental management and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks. We estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown. The regulatory and government management of these projects is complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other, the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements. If further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these liabilities, the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated. Adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which accruals are established are made. The factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include:
•
Current regulations, both at the time the liability is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process, which specify standards for acceptable remediation;
•
Information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated;
•
The professional judgment of senior level internal staff and outside consultants, who take into account similar, recent instances of environmental remediation issues, and studies of our sites, among other considerations;
•
Available technologies that can be used for remediation; and
•
The number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation.
46 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2021
SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
Our accrued environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2021 included $6 million related to the Portland Harbor Superfund site. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a determination of the amount of natural resource damages or of the allocation among the potentially responsible parties of costs of the investigations, remedial action costs, or natural resource damages, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely or which it is reasonably possible that we may incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Therefore, no additional amounts have been accrued. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor which are currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. See “Contingencies - Environmental” in Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Income Taxes
Valuation Allowances
We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. Due to the significant judgment involved, realizability of our deferred tax assets is considered a critical accounting estimate. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain state and Canadian deferred tax assets.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
We have not identified any recent accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Debt, net of cash
Debt, net of cash is the difference between (i) the sum of long-term debt and short-term borrowings (i.e., total debt) and (ii) cash and cash equivalents. We believe that presenting debt, net of cash is useful to investors as a measure of our leverage, as cash and cash equivalents can be used, among other things, to repay indebtedness.
The following is a reconciliation of debt, net of cash (in thousands):
Net borrowings (repayments) of debt
Net borrowings (repayments) of debt is the sum of borrowings from long-term debt and repayments of long-term debt. We present this amount as the net change in our borrowings (repayments) for the period because we believe it is useful for investors as a meaningful presentation of the change in debt.
