ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report (collectively, the “Financial Statements”).
Overview
On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of VSB Bancorp, Inc. (“Victory”), parent company of Victory State Bank, in a stock transaction which after purchase accounting adjustments added approximately $402.8 million in total assets, $180.4 million in loans, and $354.6 million in deposits. Victory State Bank operated six full-service banking offices in Staten Island, New York, two of which were subsequently consolidated into existing bank branches as of December 31, 2020.
Net income was $37.0 million, or $0.76 per common share, and $40.2 million, or $0.85 per common share, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflected $5.8 million after tax ($0.12 per share) in incremental loan loss provisions related to an increase in estimated loss factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, $3.3 million after tax ($0.07) in merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition of Victory, and $1.6 million after-tax ($0.03 per share) in occupancy costs related to branch consolidations; partially offset by $479,000 after tax ($0.01 per share) in gains on loans sold, and a $445,000 after-tax reduction ($0.01 per share) in the allowance for loan losses related to the sale of loans. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019, benefited from $3.4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, of tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies, and $1.6 million, after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, of income related to recoveries on loans previously charged-off, partially offset by $755,000 after-tax in occupancy costs, related to branch consolidations, and $125,000 of merger-related costs, for a total of $0.02 per diluted share. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 benefited from excess tax benefits of $2.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to the exercise or vesting of equity awards.
Our assets increased by $459.2 million, or 9.1%, to $5.51 billion at December 31, 2020, from $5.06 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the Victory acquisition, which added $402.8 million to total assets. Loans (held-for-investment, net, and held-for-sale) increased by $406.0 million, or 11.8%, available-for sale debt securities increased by $126.5 million, or 11.1%, and bank owned life insurance increased by $8.5 million, or 5.5%. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $60.3 million, or 40.8%, and FHLBNY stock of $10.9 million, or 27.6%, and an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $8.9 million, or 31.0%. The increase in assets was funded by a $668.3 million, or 19.6%, increase in deposits to $4.08 billion at December 31, 2020, from $3.41 billion at December 31, 2019. Borrowings decreased $265.2 million, or 30.9%, to $591.8 million at December 31, 2020, from $857.0 million.
Our stockholders’ equity increased by $58.1 million, or 8.4%, to $754.0 million at December 31, 2020, from $695.9 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to common stock issued in conjunction with the Victory acquisition, which resulted in a $41.2 million increase in equity. Additionally, there was an $8.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with unrealized gains on our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio, net income of $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a $3.2 million increase in equity award activity. The increases were partially offset by $21.5 million in dividend payments and $10.3 million in stock repurchases.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operation depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are the following:
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover probable and reasonably estimable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses that is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we make significant estimates and judgments. The determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover identifiable losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable.
Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. This quarterly process is performed by the accounting department, in conjunction with the credit administration department, and approved by the Allowance Committee. The Chief Financial Officer performs a final review of the calculation. All supporting documentation with regard to the evaluation process is maintained by the accounting department. Each quarter a summary of the allowance for loan losses is presented by the Chief Financial Officer to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
The allowance for loan losses has an element for individually evaluated impaired loans held-for-investment and PCI loans, and an element for loans collectively evaluated for impairment.
Management has defined an impaired loan (excluding PCI loans) to be a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that we will not collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We have defined the population of impaired loans to be all non-accrual loans with an outstanding balance of $500,000 or greater, and all loans identified as a TDR. Impaired loans are individually evaluated for impairment to determine that the loan’s carrying value is not in excess of the estimated fair value of the collateral (less cost to sell), if the loan is collateral dependent, or the present value of the expected future cash flows, if the loan is not collateral dependent. Management performs a detailed evaluation of each impaired loan and generally obtains updated appraisals as part of the evaluation. In addition, management adjusts estimated fair values down to appropriately consider recent market conditions, our willingness to accept, when appropriate, a lower sales price to effect a quick sale, and costs to dispose of any supporting collateral. Determining the estimated fair value of underlying collateral (and related costs to sell) can be difficult in illiquid real estate markets and is subject to significant assumptions and estimates. Management employs an independent third-party expert in appraisal preparation and review to ascertain the reasonableness of all appraisals. Projecting the expected cash flows under TDRs is inherently subjective and requires, among other things, an evaluation of the borrower’s current and projected financial condition. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections, and our allowance for loan losses on these loans, and could have a material effect on our financial results.
The second element of the allowance for loan losses is the allowance for loans collectively evaluated for impairment. This evaluation excludes impaired, trouble-debt restructured, and PCI loans, with the remaining loans being placed into groups with similar risk characteristics, primarily loan type, loan-to-value ratio, and internal credit risk rating. We apply an estimated loss rate to each loan group comprised of historical quantitative loss rates and qualitative factors. The quantitative loss rates are based on our historical net loss rates (using a look-back period and adjusted for loss emergence periods). Qualitative adjustments to such loss rates are made when internal or external factors are identified which may not be fully captured in our historical quantitative net loss rates such as:
•changes in lending policies and procedures;
•changes in local, regional, national, and international economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of our portfolio, including the condition of various market segments;
•changes in the size and composition of our portfolio and in the terms of our loans;
•changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;
•changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;
•changes in the quality of our loan review system;
•changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans;
•the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and
•the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our existing portfolio.
The loss emergence periods are estimated from the date of the loss event to the actual recognition of the loss (typically the first charge-off), and are determined based upon a study of the Company's past loss experience by loan groups. The evaluation for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions. Actual loan losses may be significantly different than the allowance for loan losses we have established, which could have a material effect on our financial results.
We have a concentration of loans secured by real property located in New York City, New Jersey, and, to a lesser extent, eastern Pennsylvania. As a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisal valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals are reviewed by management and an independent third-party appraiser to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the collateral. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks are increases in interest rates, a decline in the economy generally, or a decline in real estate market values in New York, New Jersey, or eastern Pennsylvania. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in delinquencies, increased loan losses, and future loan loss provisions.
Although we believe we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, changes may be necessary if future economic or other conditions differ substantially from our estimation of the current operating environment. Although management uses the information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of their examination process, will review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
Additionally, held-for-investment loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration are initially valued at an estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, with no initial related allowance for loan losses. These loans are collectively evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis as part of our analysis of the allowance for loan losses.
We also maintain an allowance for estimated losses on off-balance sheet credit risks related to loan commitments and standby letters of credit. Management utilizes a methodology similar to its allowance for loan loss methodology to estimate losses on these items. The allowance for estimated credit losses on these items is included in other liabilities and any changes to the allowance are recorded as a component of other non-interest expense.
PCI Loans. PCI loans are subject to our internal credit review. If and when credit deterioration occurs at the loan pool level subsequent to the acquisition date, a provision for credit losses for PCI loans will be charged to earnings for the full amount of the decline in expected cash flows for the pool. Under the accounting guidance for acquired credit-impaired loans, the allowance for loan losses on PCI loans is measured at each financial reporting date based on future expected cash flows. This assessment and measurement is performed at the pool level and not at the individual loan level. Accordingly, decreases in expected cash flows resulting from further credit deterioration, on a pool basis, as of such measurement date compared to those originally estimated are recognized by recording a provision for credit losses on PCI loans. Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows of the loans in each pool would first reduce any allowance for loan losses on PCI loans; and any excess will be accreted prospectively as a yield adjustment. The analysis of expected cash flows for pools incorporates updated pool level expected prepayment rates, default rates, delinquency levels, and loan level loss severity given default assumptions. The expected cash flows are estimated based on factors which include loan grades established in Northfield Bank's ongoing credit review program, likelihood of default based on observations of specific loans during the credit review process as well as applicable industry data, loss severity based on updated evaluation of cash flows from available collateral, and the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreement. Actual cash flows could differ from those expected, and others provided with the same information could draw different reasonable conclusions and calculate different expected cash flows.
Deferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed quarterly as regulatory and business factors change. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline, or if we project lower levels of future taxable income. Such a valuation allowance would be established and any subsequent changes to such allowance would require an adjustment to income tax expense that could adversely affect our operating results.
Implementation of New Accounting Standard for Accounting for Allowance for Loan Losses
ASU No. 2016-13. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). This guidance was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2019-04, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments”; ASU No. 2019-05, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief”; and ASU No. 2019-11, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses”. ASU No. 2016-13 and its subsequent updates are collectively known as “CECL”. CECL replaces the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probable threshold is met with a requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or purchased. For available-for-sale debt securities where fair value is less than cost, credit-related impairment would be recognized in an allowance for credit losses and adjusted in each subsequent period for changes in credit risk. CECL also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for credit losses.
ASU 2016-13 and its related amendments were initially effective for financial statements for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company elected to defer the adoption of the CECL methodology permitted by the recently enacted CARES Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, which provided financial institutions with the option to defer adoption of ASU 2016-13 until the earlier of the end of the pandemic or December 31, 2020. This relief was further extended by the Consolidations Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020, to the earlier of the first day of an entity's fiscal year after the date the national emergency terminates or January 1, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 and its related amendments on January 1, 2021, using a modified retrospective approach. Our implementation process included: assessment and documentation of governance and reporting processes and related internal controls; model development, documentation and validation; and the incorporation of qualitative adjustments for model limitations, among other things. We contracted with a third-party vendor to assist us in the application of ASU 2016-13. ASU 2016-13 lists several credit loss methods that are acceptable such as a discounted cash flow method, loss-rate method and probability of default/loss given default (“PD/LGD”) method. The Company will utilize the PD/LGD methodology to estimate its allowance for loan losses.
Our CECL model includes the following major items:
•a historical loss period, which represents a full economic credit cycle utilizing internal loss experience, as well as peer historical loss data;
•a reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years, based on management’s current review of macroeconomic factors and the reliability of extended economic forecasts based on forecast data from Moody's;
•a reversion period (after the reasonable and supportable forecast period) using a straight-line approach;
•expected prepayment rates based on our historical experience; and
•incorporation of qualitative factors not captured within the modeled results.
Management is currently finalizing calculations of the CECL results as of year-end. Based on several analyses performed, as well as an implementation analysis utilizing existing exposures and forecasts of macroeconomic conditions at December 31, 2020, we currently expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will result in an increase to our allowance for loan losses of approximately 10% to 15%, excluding any reclassification related to PCI loans. This increase will be reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment that decreases beginning retained earnings, net of income taxes. The expected increase in the allowance for credit losses is a result of changing from an incurred loss model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to a CECL model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. Furthermore, ASU 2016-13 necessitates that the Company establish an allowance for expected credit losses for certain debt securities and other financial assets; however, the Company does not expect to record any allowances on debt securities available-for sale.
Future amounts of provision expense related to our allowance for loan losses will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, future economic conditions and borrowers’ payment performance. Future amounts of provision related our debt securities will depend on the composition of our securities portfolio and current market conditions. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on our regulatory capital ratios.
Other New Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective
ASU No. 2020-04. On March 12, 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform ("ASC 848"): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”, which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is implementing a transition plan to identify and modify its loans and other financial instruments that are either directly or indirectly influenced by LIBOR. The Company is in the process of evaluating ASU No. 2020-04 and its impact on the Company’s transition away from LIBOR for its loan and other financial instruments, with no material expected impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU No. 2019-12. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU No. 2019-12 simplifies accounting for income taxes by removing specific technical exceptions in ASC 740 related to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition for deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU No. 2019-12 also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. ASU No. 2019-12 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU No. 2018-14. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” This ASU makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans. ASU No. 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020; early adoption is permitted. As ASU No. 2018-14 only revises disclosure requirements, it will not have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and 2019
Total assets increased $459.2 million, or 9.1%, to $5.51 billion at December 31, 2020, from $5.06 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in total loans (held-for-investment, net, and held-for-sale) of $406.0 million, or 11.8%, available-for sale debt securities of $126.5 million, or 11.1%, and bank owned life insurance of $8.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $60.3 million, or 40.8%, and FHLBNY stock of $10.9 million, or 27.6%, and an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $8.9 million, or 31.0%.
The Company’s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio increased by $126.5 million, or 11.1%, to $1.26 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.14 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to $126.9 million of securities acquired from Victory, partially offset by paydowns, maturities, calls, and sales. At December 31, 2020, $1.17 billion of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. In addition, the Company held $88.4 million in corporate bonds, all of which were considered investment grade at December 31, 2020, $3.2 million in U.S. Government agency securities, $123,000 in municipal bonds, and $798,000 in other debt securities. The effective duration of the securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 was 1.05 years.
Loans held-for-investment, net, increased $386.2 million to $3.82 billion at December 31, 2020, from $3.44 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in originated loans held-for-investment of $351.9 million, and $180.4 million of loans acquired from the Victory acquisition, partially offset by paydowns and transfers to loans held-for-sale. Originated loans held-for-investment, net, totaled $3.34 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.99 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in multifamily real estate loans of $226.3 million, or 10.3%, to $2.42 billion at December 31, 2020, from $2.20 billion at December 31, 2019, and an increase in commercial and industrial loans of $104.2 million, or 229.9%, to $149.6 million December 31, 2020, from $45.3 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to loans originated under the PPP authorized by the CARES Act. The PPP loans are administered by the SBA, which provides 100% federally guaranteed loans for small businesses to cover payroll, utilities, rent and interest. These small business loans may be forgiven if borrowers maintain their payrolls and satisfy certain other conditions for a period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we had originated over 1,000 loans, totaling approximately $118.5 million. PPP provides for lender processing fees that range from 1% to 5% of the final disbursement made to individual borrowers. As of December 31, 2020, we have received loan processing fees of $4.2 million, of which $1.6 million was recognized in earnings during 2020 and the remainder will be recognized in income over the remaining life of the loans. As part of the Victory acquisition, we acquired 395 PPP loans, totaling approximately $30.0 million. Loan processing fees totaling $1.1 million have been received, of which $276,000 has been recognized in earnings during 2020.
The following tables detail our multifamily real estate originations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
Acquired loans increased by $33.1 million to $465.7 million at December 31, 2020, from $432.7 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to $180.4 million of loans acquired from Victory, partially offset by paydowns of primarily one-to-four family residential and multifamily loans. The Victory loan portfolio was comprised of $109.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $23.9 million in construction loans, $45.3 million in commercial and industrial loans (including $30.0 million PPP loans) with the remainder primarily in residential loans.
There were no purchased pool loans in 2020. The following table provides the details of the purchased pool loans during the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1) Net of servicing fee retained by the originating bank.
The geographic locations of the properties collateralizing the loans purchased in the table above are as follows: 83% in Massachusetts, 13% in New York, and 4% in New Jersey.
PCI loans totaled $18.5 million at December 31, 2020, as compared to $17.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was due to $3.9 million of PCI loans acquired as part of the Victory acquisition, partially offset by paydowns. The majority of the PCI loan balance consists of loans acquired as part of an FDIC-assisted transaction in 2011. The Company accreted interest income attributable to PCI loans of $2.9 million, $4.1 million, and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $60.3 million, or 40.8%, to $87.5 million at December 31, 2020, from $147.8 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in cash balances at the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances fluctuate based on the timing of receipt of security and loan repayments and the redeployment of cash into higher-yielding assets such as loans and securities, or the funding of deposit outflows or borrowing maturities.
Bank owned life insurance increased $8.5 million, or 5.5%, to $161.9 million at December 31, 2020, as compared to $153.5 million at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from $5.7 million in policies added from the Victory acquisition and income earned on bank owned life insurance for the year ended December 31, 2020.
FHLBNY stock decreased by $10.9 million, or 27.6%, to $28.6 million at December 31, 2020, from $39.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in FHLBNY stock directly correlates with lower short-term borrowing balances at December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019.
Total liabilities increased $401.1 million, or 9.2%, to $4.76 billion at December 31, 2020, from $4.36 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deposits of $668.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in other borrowings of $265.2 million.
Deposits increased $668.3 million, or 19.6%, to $4.08 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $3.41 billion at December 31, 2019, due to both the Victory acquisition, which added $354.6 million to total deposits, as well as organic deposit growth. The increase was attributable to increases of $639.7 million in transaction accounts, $393.5 million in savings accounts, and $162.0 million in money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $526.9 million in certificates of deposit.
Borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased to $591.8 million at December 31, 2020, from $857.0 million at December 31, 2019. Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity, and, to a lesser extent, as part of leverage strategies.
Total stockholders’ equity increased by $58.1 million to $754.0 million at December 31, 2020, from $695.9 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to common stock issued for the purchase of Victory. The Company issued 3,837,168 shares of common stock in the Victory acquisition at a price of $10.73, which resulted in an increase in equity of $41.2 million. Additionally, there was an $8.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with unrealized gains on our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio, net income of $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a $3.2 million increase in equity award activity. The increases were partially offset by $21.5 million in dividend payments and $10.4 million in stock repurchases. The Company repurchased 885,535 shares of its common stock outstanding at an average price of $11.59 for a total of $10.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, pursuant to the stock repurchase plan which had been previously suspended in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, but was reinstated effective October 28, 2020 with 1.45 million shares remaining for repurchase. There were 564,488 shares remaining for repurchase as of December 31, 2020.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net Income. Net income was $37.0 million and $40.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Significant variances from the prior year are as follows: an $18.0 million increase in net interest income, a $12.7 million increase in the provision for loan losses, a $3.3 million decrease in non-interest income, and a $5.0 million increase in non-interest expense.
Interest Income. Interest income increased by $3.0 million, or 1.8%, to $168.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $165.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $580.5 million, or 13.2%.The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to increases in average loans of $324.9 million, average mortgage-backed securities of $237.3 million, and average interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $100.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in average other securities of $84.3 million. This was partially offset by a 38 basis point increase in the yields earned on interest-earning assets to 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.76% for the prior year. The decrease in interest-earning asset yields was due to decreases in market interest rates coupled with PPP loan originations, which have lower yields than other loans. The Company accreted interest income related to its PCI loans of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020, included loan prepayment income of $2.2 million as compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Also included in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020, were PPP fees of approximately $1.9 million. Included in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $314,000 of interest income recorded on the pay-off of a non-accrual loan.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $15.0 million, or 28.2%, to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of $16.1 million, or 39.0%, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on borrowings of $1.1 million, or 9.0%. The decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily attributable to a 63 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 0.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 1.40% for the prior year, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $318.4 million, or 10.8%, due to the Victory acquisition as well as organic deposit growth. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to the Federal Reserve's reductions in the targeted federal funds rate and a shift in the composition of the deposit portfolio towards more core deposits. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was attributable to a $69.0 million, or 12.0%, increase in average borrowings outstanding, partially offset by a six basis point decrease in the cost of borrowings to 2.03% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased $18.0 million, or 16.1%, to $129.8 million, from $111.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $580.5 million, or 13.2%, increase in average interest-earning assets as well as a six basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.61% from 2.55%. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to the decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the decrease in yields on interest earning assets. Yields earned on interest-earning assets decreased 38 basis points to 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.76% for the prior year. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 53 basis points to 0.98% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 1.51% for the prior year, driven by lower cost of deposits and borrowed funds.
Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased by $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a provision of $22,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to increases in the qualitative factors used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses related to unemployment, loan risk rating changes and increased risks related to loans on forbearance, resulting from economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher charge-offs. Year-over-year loan growth also contributed to the increase in the provision. Net charge-offs were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net recoveries of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Non-interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $3.3 million, or 22.5%, to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases of: (i) $914,000 in fees and service charges for customer services, related to fees waived due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a decline in overdrafts due to lower consumer spending; (ii) $3.2 million in income on bank owned life insurance, attributable to lower insurance proceeds received in excess of the related cash surrender value of the policies; and (iii) $387,000 in gains on trading securities, net. For the year ended December 31, 2020, gains on trading securities were $1.6 million as compared to gains of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company’s deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the Company's deferred compensation plan (the “Plan”). The participants of this Plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company’s obligations under the Plan. Partially offsetting the decreases was a $665,000 gain on the sale of a portfolio of $47.5 million in multifamily loans in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, and an increase in other income of $1.4 million, primarily attributable to an increase in swap fee income.
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $5.0 million, or 6.7%, to $78.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was due primarily to a $1.9 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, related to change-in-control and severance compensation associated with the Victory acquisition, increased salary and benefit expenses due to the addition of Victory personnel, and increased medical benefit costs. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, which is described above and has no effect on net income, and a decrease in equity award expense related to equity awards that fully vested in June 2019. Additionally, there was a $1.5 million increase in occupancy costs primarily attributable to costs associated with the branch consolidations, and to a lesser extent, higher rent expense associated with additional branches from the Victory acquisition, and a $2.4 million increase in data processing costs, $1.3 million of which relates to a contract termination penalty associated with the completion of Victory's core systems conversion. Partially offsetting the increases was a $1.4 million decrease in advertising expense, due to fewer marketing campaigns in 2020, and an $820,000 decrease in other non-interest expense, primarily related to a decrease in directors' equity award expense associated with awards that fully vested in June 2019.
Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded income tax expense of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 26.1% compared to 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to lower tax exempt income of $2.4 million from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies received, compared to the prior year, and non-deductible merger-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Net Income. Net income was $40.2 million and $40.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Significant variances from the prior year are as follows: a $543,000 increase in net interest income, a $2.6 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $6.7 million increase in non-interest income, a $6.5 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $3.2 million increase in income tax expense.
Interest Income. Interest income increased by $17.9 million, or 12.1%, to $165.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $147.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $427.7 million, or 10.8%, and a four basis point increase in the yields earned. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to increases in average loans of $120.9 million, average mortgage-backed securities of $237.1 million, and average other securities of $62.8 million. The Company accreted interest income related to its PCI loans of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, included loan prepayment income of $1.6 million, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Also included in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 is $314,000 of interest income recorded from the pay-off of a non-accrual loan.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $17.3 million, or 48.0%, to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to an increase of $13.6 million in interest expense on deposits and an increase of $3.7 million in interest expense on borrowings. The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributable to an increase in average balances of interest-bearing deposits of $310.3 million, or 11.8%, to $2.95 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $2.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, and a 35 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.40% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 1.05% for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by increased market interest rates and competitive pricing pressure for deposits. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was attributable to a $117.1 million, or 25.5%, increase in average borrowings outstanding, and a 28 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings to 2.09% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 1.81% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased $543,000, or 0.5%, to $111.8 million, from $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $427.7 million, or 10.8%, increase in our average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 26 basis point decrease in our net interest margin to 2.55% from 2.81%. Yields earned on interest-earning assets increased four basis points to 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 3.72% for the prior year, primarily driven by higher yields on loans and securities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 35 basis points to 1.51% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 1.16% for the prior year, due to the increased cost of deposits and borrowed funds, reflecting increased market interest rates.
Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses decreased by $2.6 million to $22,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in the provision was primarily due to a $1.8 million recovery on a loan previously charged-off and an improvement in asset quality indicators, offset by a $521,000 charge-off on an impaired commercial real estate loan, and loan growth. Net recoveries were $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net charge-offs of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Non-interest Income. Non-interest income increased $6.7 million, or 82.2%, to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in income on bank owned life insurance, attributable to $3.4 million of insurance proceeds in excess of the related cash surrender value of the policies, and an increase of $2.9 million in gains on trading securities, net. For the year ended December 31, 2019, gains on trading securities were $2.0 million, as compared to losses of $879,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $6.5 million, or 9.7%, to $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was due primarily to increases of $4.8 million in employee compensation and benefits; $1.6 million in occupancy costs; $668,000 in data processing costs; and $716,000 in advertising costs. Of the $4.8 million increase in compensation and employee benefits, $2.9 million was related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, with the remainder attributable to increased costs associated with new hires related to a branch opening and new lending personnel, merit increases effective January 1, 2019, and higher medical benefit costs, partially offset by a decrease in equity award expense. The increase in occupancy costs was primarily attributable to costs associated with the consolidation of three branches, and to a lesser extent higher rent expense associated with a new branch opening. The increase in data processing costs was related to our continued strategic initiative to enhance our technology solutions both internally and to our customers, and growth in the number of accounts we service. The increase in advertising expense was attributable to the timing of advertising programs and increased expenditure focused on driving growth. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $502,000 in federal insurance premiums due to a reduction in our deposit insurance assessment as a result of the utilization of credits, and $869,000 in other non-interest expense, primarily related to a decrease in Directors' equity award expense. Non-interest expense included equity award expense of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The lower expense in the current year was primarily attributable to equity awards that were fully vested on June 11, 2019.
On September 16, 2019, the Company announced its intention to consolidate three branch offices (two located in Brooklyn, New York, and one in Milltown, New Jersey) into existing nearby Northfield Bank locations. The branch consolidations were effective December 31, 2019, and the Company recorded a one-time charge in occupancy costs of approximately $1.0 million, attributable to accelerated lease rental expense and accelerated leasehold amortization expense. The Company expects the benefit of annual pre-tax cost savings of approximately $1.5 million going forward as a result of the consolidation.
Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded income tax expense of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, was 24.1%, compared to 19.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to lower excess tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of equity awards and changes in New Jersey tax laws, partially offset by $3.4 million of tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies. There were no material excess tax benefits recorded for year ended December 31, 2019. Excess tax benefits were $2.7 million for year ended December 31, 2018. Excess tax benefits will fluctuate throughout the year based on the Company's stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other share-based awards.
May 2019, the State of New Jersey issued a tax technical bulletin, subsequently revised in December 2019, which gives guidance on the treatment of real estate investment trusts in connection with the combined reporting for New Jersey corporate business tax purposes. Real estate investment trusts and investment companies will be excluded from the combined group and will continue to file separate New Jersey tax returns. As a result of this guidance the Company recorded an additional $889,000 of state tax expense net of federal benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $889,000 increase was comprised of $1.1 million of current tax expense, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets of $239,000.
Average Balances and Yields
The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as we had no tax-free interest-earning assets during the years. All average balances are daily average balances based upon amortized costs. Non-accrual loans are included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.
(1) Includes non-accruing loans.
(2) Securities available-for-sale are reported at amortized cost.
(3) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities.
(4) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.
(5) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Asset Quality
PCI Loans
PCI loans are recorded at estimated fair value using discounted expected future cash flows deemed to be collectible on the date acquired. Based on its detailed review of PCI loans and experience in loan workouts, management believes it has a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of future cash flows and accordingly has classified PCI loans ($18.5 million at December 31, 2020) as accruing, even though they may be contractually past due. At December 31, 2020, 9.6% of PCI loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 35.2% were past due 90 days or more, as compared to 20.9% and 24.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2019.
Originated and Acquired Loan
The discussion that follows includes originated and acquired loans, both held-for-investment and held-for-sale.
General. Maintaining loan quality historically has been, and will continue to be, a key element of our business strategy. We employ conservative underwriting standards for new loan originations and maintain sound credit administration practices while the loans are outstanding. In addition, substantially all of our loans are secured, predominantly by real estate. At December 31, 2020, our non-performing loans totaled $29.5 million, or 0.77%, of total loans which included $19.9 million of loans held-for-sale. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $3.8 million, or 0.11%, of average loans outstanding and include $3.6 million related to higher risk commercial and multifamily loans transferred to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had net recoveries of $1.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2018, net charge-offs were $1.3 million, or 0.04%, of average loans outstanding.
Non-performing Assets and Delinquent Loans. The following table details non-performing assets consisting of non-performing loans held-for-investment and non-performing loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
The following table details non-performing loans by loan type at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Loans held-for-sale are comprised of high risk, primarily commercial real estate accommodation (hotel/motel) loans, that were modified in the form of interest and/or principal payment deferrals due to COVID-19 related hardships, and have not returned to contractual payments after 180 days of relief and were transferred to held-for-sale. The Company expects the sale to occur in the first quarter of 2021.
Generally, loans, excluding PCI loans, are placed on non-accruing status when they become 90 days or more delinquent, and remain on non-accrual status until they are brought current, have six consecutive months of performance under the loan terms, and factors indicating reasonable doubt about the timely collection of payments no longer exist. Therefore, loans may be current in accordance with their loan terms, or may be less than 90 days delinquent and still be on a non-accruing status.
The following table sets forth the total amounts of delinquencies for accruing loans that were 30 to 89 days past due by type and by amount at the dates indicated (in thousands):
The increase in accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent from December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in delinquencies associated with a deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Included in non-accruing loans held-for-investment are loans subject to restructuring agreements (“TDRs”) totaling $3.7 million and $4.4 million at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, two of the non-accruing TDRs totaling $462,500 were not performing in accordance with their restructured terms, and are collateralized by real estate with an appraised value of $620,000. At December 31, 2019, two of the non-accruing TDRs totaling $255,000 were not performing in accordance with their restructured terms, and are collateralized by real estate with an aggregate estimated fair value of $946,000.
The Company also holds loans held-for-investment subject to restructuring agreements that are on accrual status, which totaled $7.7 million and $14.1 million at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, $6.5 million, or 84.1%, of the $7.7 million of accruing loans subject to restructuring agreements were performing in accordance with their restructured terms. At December 31, 2019, $13.8 million, or 97.3%, of the $14.1 million of accruing loans subject to restructuring agreements were performing in accordance with their restructured terms. Generally, the types of concessions that we make to troubled borrowers include both temporary and permanent reductions to interest rates, extensions of payment terms, and, to a lesser extent, forgiveness of principal and interest.
The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of TDRs as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019 (in thousands):
COVID-19 Exposure
Management continues to evaluate the Company's exposure to increased loan losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the commercial real estate and multifamily loan portfolios. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a customer relief program to assist borrowers that may be experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 related challenges. The relief program grants principal and/or interest payment deferrals typically for a period of 90 days, which management may choose to extend for an additional 90 days, for a maximum of 180 days on a cumulative and successive basis. At the peak of forbearance, the Company had 286 loans approved for payment deferral representing $360.2 million, or approximately 10% of the Company's loan portfolio (excluding PCI loans). As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $31.3 million, or 29 outstanding loans (excluding PCI and held-for-sale loans) approved for or executed forbearance, representing approximately 0.8% of the Company’s outstanding loan portfolio (excluding PCI and held-for-sale loans) as of that date. Loans currently in deferment status (“COVID-19 Modified Loans”) will continue to accrue interest during the deferment period unless otherwise classified as non-performing. COVID-19 Modified Loans are required to make escrow payments for real estate taxes and insurance, if applicable. The COVID-19 Modified Loan agreements also require loans to be brought back to their fully contractual terms within 12 to 18 months and include covenants that prohibit distributions, bonuses, or payments of management fees to related entities until all deferred payments are made. Consistent with industry regulatory guidance, borrowers that were otherwise current on loan payments that were granted COVID-19 related financial hardship payment deferrals will continue to be reported as current loans throughout the agreed upon deferral period. Borrowers, which were delinquent in their payments to the Bank, prior to requesting a COVID-19 related financial hardship payment deferral are reviewed on a case by case basis for TDR classification and non-performing loan status.
The following table sets forth the property types collateralizing our originated and acquired (excluding PCI and held-for-sale) loans and loans approved for/in forbearance as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1) Property type is apartment units equal or greater than five units.
(2) Excludes nine loans with aggregate unpaid principal balances of $23.5 million that have been reclassified to loans held for sale on the balance sheet at an estimated net realizable value of $19.9 million.
(3) Includes four loans totaling $3.1 million for which forbearance has been approved but not yet executed as of December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans decreased from 288.48% at December 31, 2019 to 127.38% at December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in non-performing loans of $19.6 million, from $10.0 million at December 31, 2019 to $29.5 million at December 31, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company transferred $19.9 million of certain high risk, primarily commercial real estate accommodation (hotel/motel) loans, that were modified in the form of interest and/or principal payment deferrals due to COVID-19 related hardships, and have not returned to contractual payments after 180 days of relief, to held-for-sale.
The Company utilizes external appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analysis of impaired loans. A third-party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as an impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required. Generally, non-performing loans are charged down to the appraised value of collateral less costs to sell, which reduces the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans. Downward adjustments to appraisal values, primarily to reflect “quick sale” discounts, are generally recorded as specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses to originated loans held-for-investment, net, was 1.10% (1.13% excluding PPP loans which are fully government guaranteed and do not carry any allowance for loan losses) at December 31, 2020, as compared to 0.93% at December 31, 2019. The increase in the loan coverage ratio from December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to an $8.9 million increase in the allowance for loan losses attributable to increases in the qualitative factors used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses related to unemployment, loan risk rating changes and increased risks related to loans on forbearance, resulting from economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher charge-offs. Net charge-offs were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net recoveries of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and net charge-offs of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020, include $3.6 million related to higher risk commercial real estate and multifamily loans transferred to held-for-sale at estimated net realizable value in the fourth quarter of 2020. The provision for loan losses was $12.7 million, $22,000 and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Specific reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment decreased by $69,000, or 49%, from $142,000 at December 31, 2019, to $73,000 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had 26 loans classified as impaired and recorded $73,000 of specific reserves on four of the 26 impaired loans. At December 31, 2019, the Company had 29 loans classified as impaired and recorded $142,000 of specific reserves on three of the 29 impaired loans.
The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses, by loan type, at December 31, for the years indicated (in thousands):
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $3.8 million, as compared to net recoveries of $1.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and net charge-offs of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Charge-offs in 2020 are primarily related to high risk, commercial real estate accommodation (hotel/motel) loans on COVID-19 forbearance that were transferred to held-for-sale. The net recoveries in 2019 were primarily due to a $1.8 million recovery on a multifamily loan previously charged-off, partially offset by a $521,000 charge-off on an impaired commercial real estate loan. Charge-offs in 2018 were primarily related to a $1.2 million charge-off on an impaired commercial real estate loan. As a result of increases in outstanding balances, driven by originated loan growth and an increase in qualitative factors used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The increase in the allowance for PCI loans was attributable to the annual recasting of PCI cash flows.
Management of Market Risk
General. A majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage-related securities and loans, generally have longer maturities than our liabilities, which consist primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy involves managing interest rate risk and limiting the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established a Management Asset-Liability Committee, comprised of our SVP & Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer, who chairs this Committee, our President and Chief Executive Officer, our EVP & Chief Risk Officer, EVP & Chief Financial Officer, EVP & Chief Lending Officer, EVP Branch Administration and Business Development, SVP and Chief Credit Officer and SVP & Director of Marketing, and other officers and staff as necessary or appropriate. This committee is responsible for, among other things, evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for recommending to the risk management committee of our Board of Directors the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
We seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. As part of our ongoing asset-liability management, we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:
•originating multifamily loans and commercial real estate loans that generally have shorter maturities than one-to-four family residential real estate loans and have higher interest rates that generally reset from five to ten years;
•investing in investment grade corporate securities and mortgage-backed securities; and
•obtaining general financing through lower-cost core deposits, brokered deposits, and longer-term FHLB advances and repurchase agreements.
Shortening the average term of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term assets, as well as originating loans with variable interest rates, helps to match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities better, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates.
Net Portfolio Value Analysis. We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (net portfolio value or NPV) would change in the event market interest rates changed over an assumed range of rates. Our simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis to measure the interest rate sensitivity of our NPV. Depending on current market interest rates, we estimate the economic value of these assets and liabilities under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, or a decrease of 100 and 200 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the “Change in Interest Rates” column below.
Net Interest Income Analysis. In addition to NPV calculations, we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. In our model, we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve-month period. Depending on current market interest rates we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, or a decrease of 100 and 200 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment.
The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our calculation of the estimated changes in our NPV, NPV ratio, and percent change in net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands). Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit repricing characteristics including decay rates, and correlations to movements in interest rates, and should not be relied on as indicative of actual results.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2020, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 19.65% increase in estimated net portfolio value and a 3.70% decrease in net interest income in year one and a 7.89% decrease in net income in year two. In the event of a 400 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience an 3.41% decrease in estimated net portfolio value and a 1.52% increase in net interest income in year one and a 20.02% increase in net interest income in year two.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2019, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 13.30% increase in estimated net portfolio value and a 0.63% increase in net interest income in year one and a 4.18% decrease in net income in year two. In the event of a 400 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 17.91% decrease in estimated net portfolio value and a 17.51% decrease in net interest income in year one and a 3.90% decrease in net interest income in year two.
Our policies provide that, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less in interest rates, our net present value ratio should decrease by no more than 300 basis points and 10%, and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our net present value should decrease by no more than 475 basis points and 35%. In the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 10% in year one and 10% in year two, and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 30% in year one and 20% in year two. However, when the federal funds rate is low and negative rate shocks do not produce meaningful results, management may temporarily suspend use of guidelines for negative interest rate shocks. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all Board-approved policies with respect to interest rate risk management.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income. Our model requires us to make certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. However, we also apply consistent parallel yield curve shifts (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve shifts occurred gradually. Net interest income analysis also adjusts the asset and liability repricing analysis based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts. In addition, the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net portfolio value or net interest income and will differ from actual results.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability to fund assets and meet obligations as they come due. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, borrowings through repurchase agreements and advances from money center banks and the FHLBNY, and repayments, maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are reasonably predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our Board Risk Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and withdrawals of deposits by our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We seek to maintain a ratio of liquid assets (not subject to pledge or encumbered) as a percentage of deposits and borrowings of 35% or greater. At December 31, 2020, this ratio was 51.20%. We believe that we had sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs at December 31, 2020.
We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based on our assessment of:
•expected loan demand;
•expected deposit flows;
•yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and
•the objectives of our asset/liability management program.
Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, corporate bonds, and unpledged mortgage-related securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, that we can either borrow against or sell. We also have the ability to surrender bank-owned life insurance contracts. The surrender of these contracts would subject the Company to income taxes and penalties for increases in the cash surrender values over the original premium payments. We also have the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank utilizing unencumbered and unpledged securities and multifamily loans. Any amount pledged for such deposits under the line of credit reduces the Company's available borrowing amount under the FHLB advance agreement. The Company continues to maintain a strong liquidity position, despite the economic uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business.
The Company had the following primary sources of liquidity at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1) Excludes $16,115 of cash at Northfield Bank.
(2) Represents remaining borrowing potential.
At December 31, 2020, we had $81.3 million in outstanding loan commitments. In addition, we had $154.0 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2020, totaled $375.2 million, or 9.2% of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including loan sales, securities sales, other deposit products, including replacement certificates of deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), and advances from the FHLBNY and other borrowing sources. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit. Based on experience, we believe that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, and we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
We have a detailed contingency funding plan that is reviewed and reported to the Board Risk Committee at least quarterly. This plan includes monitoring cash on a daily basis to determine the liquidity needs of Northfield Bank. Additionally, management performs a stress test on Northfield Bank’s retail deposits and wholesale funding sources in several scenarios on a quarterly basis. The stress scenarios include deposit attrition of up to 50%, and selling our securities available-for-sale portfolio at a discount of 20% to its current estimated fair value. Northfield Bank continues to maintain significant liquidity under all stress scenarios.
Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is a separate legal entity from Northfield Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to fund dividend payments, stock repurchases, and other corporate risk factors. The Company’s primary source of liquidity is the receipt of dividend payments from the Bank in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2020, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. (unconsolidated) had liquid assets of $21.5 million.
Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. are both subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2020, both Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and are considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See “Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation” and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit, and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process applicable to loans we originate. In addition, we routinely enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans; such amounts are not significant to our operations. For additional information, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities, and agreements with respect to investments.
The following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at December 31, 2020 (in thousands). The payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments.
(1) Includes FHLBNY advances, repurchase agreements and accrued interest payable at December 31, 2020.
(2) Includes unused lines of credit which are assumed to be funded within the year.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The effect of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater effect on our performance than inflation.
