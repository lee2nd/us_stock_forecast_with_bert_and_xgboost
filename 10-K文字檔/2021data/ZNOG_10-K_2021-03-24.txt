ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Introduction
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of our discussion is forward-looking and involves risks and uncertainties. For information regarding factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, refer to Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Report.
Overview
Zion Oil and Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of 21 years of oil and gas exploration in Israel. We were incorporated in Florida on April 6, 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2003. We completed our initial public offering in January 2007. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) currently trades on the OTCQX under the symbol “ZNOG” and our Common Stock warrant under the symbol “ZNOGW.”
The Company currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the New Megiddo License 428, comprising approximately 99,000 acres. The Megiddo Jezreel #1 (“MJ #1”) site was completed in early March 2017, after which the drilling rig and associated equipment were mobilized to the site. Performance and endurance tests were completed, and the MJ #1 exploratory well was spud on June 5, 2017 and drilled to a total depth (“TD”) of 5,060 meters (approximately 16,600 feet). Thereafter, the Company obtained three open-hole wireline log suites (including a formation image log), and the well was successfully cased and cemented. The Ministry of Energy approved the well testing protocol on April 29, 2018.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company testing protocol was concluded at the MJL well. The test results confirmed that the MJ #1 well did not contain hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the zones tested. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to its unproved oil and gas properties of $30,906,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not record any post-impairment charges. The Company recorded a post-impairment charge of $314,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
While the well was not commercially viable, Zion learned a great deal from the drilling and testing of this well. We believe that the drilling and testing of this well carried out the testing objectives and supported further evaluation and potential further exploration efforts within our License area.
While not meant to be an exhaustive list, a summary of what Zion believes to be key information learned in the MJ#1 well is as follows:
1. The MJ#1 encountered much higher subsurface temperatures at a depth shallower than expected before drilling the well. In our opinion, this is significant because reaching a minimum temperature threshold is necessary for the generation of hydrocarbons from an organic-rich source rock.
2. The known organic rich (potentially hydrocarbon bearing) Senonian age source rocks that are typically present in this part of Israel were not encountered as expected. Zion expected these source rocks to be encountered at approximately 1,000 meters in the MJ#1 well.
3. MJ#1 had natural fractures, permeability (the ability of fluid to move through the rock) and porosity (pore space in rock) that allowed the sustained flow of formation fluid in the shallower Jurassic and lower Cretaceous age formations between approximately 1,200 and 1,800 meters. While no hydrocarbons were encountered, Zion believes this fact is nonetheless significant because it provides important information about possible reservoir pressures and the ability of fluids to move within the formation and to the surface.
4. MJ#1 encountered oil in the Triassic Mohilla formation which Zion believes suggests an active deep petroleum system is in Zion’s license area. There was no natural permeability or porosity in the Triassic Mohilla formation to allow formation fluid to reach the surface naturally during testing, and thus the MJ#1 was not producible or commercial.
5. The depths and thickness of the formations we encountered varied greatly from pre-drill estimates. This required the MJ#1 to be drilled to a much greater depth than previously expected. Zion has tied these revised formation depths to seismic data which will allow for more accurate interpretation and mapping in the future.
A summary of what Zion believes to be some key questions left to be answered are:
1. Is the missing shallow Senonian age source rock a result of regional erosion, or is it missing because of a fault that cut the well-bore and could be reasonably expected to be encountered in the vicinity of the MJ#1 drill site? Zion believes this is an important question to answer because if the Senonian source rocks do exist in this area, the high temperatures encountered are sufficient to mature these source rocks and generate oil.
2. Do the unusually high shallow subsurface temperatures extend regionally beyond the MJ#1 well, which could allow for the generation of hydrocarbons in the Senonian age source rock within our license area?
3. As a consequence of seismic remapping, where does the MJ#1 well lie relative to the potential traps at the Jurassic and Triassic levels and was the well location too low on the structures and deeper than the potential hydrocarbons within those traps?
As a result of these unanswered questions and with the information gained drilling the MJ#1 well, Zion believed it was prudent and consistent with good industry practice to try and answer some of these questions with a focused 3-D seismic imaging shoot of approximately 72 square kilometers surrounding the MJ#1 well. As of the date of this report, Zion has completed all of the acquisition, processing and interpretation of the 3-D data and has incorporated its expanded knowledge base into the drilling of our current MJ-02 exploratory well (see further details below).
The Geology team is continuing on a larger interpretation of 3D areas, along with potential exploration locations in the western portion of the New Megiddo License 428 area.
The MJ02 drilling plan, which anticipates approximately five (5) months to drill and test the well, was approved by the Ministry of Energy on July 29, 2020. The Ministry of Energy also requested the approvals of the Building Planning Commission which Zion obtained in late Q2 2020.
On March 12, 2020, Zion entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Central European Drilling kft, a Hungarian corporation, to purchase an onshore oil and gas drilling rig, drilling pipe, related equipment and spare parts for a purchase price of $5.6 million in cash, subject to acceptance testing and potential downward adjustment. We remitted to the Seller $250,000 on February 6, 2020 as earnest money towards the Purchase Price. The Closing anticipated by the Agreement took place on March 12, 2020 by the Seller’s execution and delivery of a Bill of Sale to us. On March 13, 2020, the Seller retained the earnest money deposit, and the Company remitted $4,350,000 to the seller towards the purchase price and $1,000,000 (the “Holdback Amount”) was deposited in escrow with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company LLC.
I-35 Drilling Rig & Associated Equipment
31 December 2020
(1) These are the initial cash payments for the purchase of the I-35 drilling rig in early 2020
(2) Capitalized costs include inspection, quarantine, labor, transportation, insurance, and other costs required to place the I-35 drilling rig in service initially, per GAAP.
On January 6, 2021, Zion completed its acceptance testing of the I-35 drilling rig and the Holdback Amount was remitted to Central European Drilling on January 8, 2021.
Zion’s ability to fully undertake all of these aforementioned activities was subject to its raising the needed capital through the issuance of our securities, and we anticipate we will continue to need to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities). No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising the needed equity on favorable terms (or at all).
Our executive offices are located at 12655 N Central Expressway, Suite 1000, Dallas, Texas 75243, and our telephone number is (214) 221-4610. Our field office in Israel is located at 9 Halamish Street, North Industrial Park, Caesarea 3088900, and the telephone number is +972-4-623-8500.
Principal Components of our Cost Structure
Our operating and other expenses primarily consist of the following:
● Impairment of Unproved Oil and Gas Properties: Impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will not be commercially productive. The amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to Israeli regulatory authorities.
● General and Administrative Expenses: Overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of managing our exploratory operations, audit and other professional fees, and legal compliance is included in general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses also include non-cash stock-based compensation expense, investor relations related expenses, lease and insurance and related expenses.
● Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion: The systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and oil represents a principal component of our cost structure. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with our exploration, and apportion these costs to each unit of production, if any, through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. As we have yet to have production, the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included in this amortization pool.
Going Concern Basis
Since we have limited capital resources, no revenue to date and a loss from operations, our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital and, ultimately, to achieve profitable operations. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period.
We have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment.
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties
We follow the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized.
All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved reserves. Investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in income from continuing operations before income taxes, and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.
Our oil and gas properties represent an investment in unproved properties. These costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established. A further impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.
Abandonment of properties is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs. The net capitalized costs are subject to a “ceiling test” which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. The recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves, together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company testing protocol was concluded at the MJ #1 well. The test results confirmed that the MJ #1 well did not contain hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the zones tested. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to its unproved oil and gas properties of $30,906,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not record any post-impairment charges. The Company recorded a post-impairment charge of $314,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 (see note 4).
Following the impairment charge noted above, the total net book value of our unproved oil and gas properties under the full cost method is $15,526,000 at December 31, 2020.
Currency Utilized
Although our oil & gas properties and our principal operations are in Israel, we report all our transactions in United States dollars. Certain dollar amounts in the consolidated financial statements may represent the dollar equivalent of other currencies.
Valuation of Deferred Taxes
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe is likely to be realized in the future. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we have considered not only future taxable income but also feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. In the event that we were to determine that it would be likely that we would, in the future, realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made. In the period that such a determination was made, the adjustment to the deferred tax asset would produce an increase in our net income.
Asset Retirement Obligation
We record a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets.
Fair Value Considerations
We follow ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Financial Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 and related guidance. Those provisions relate to the Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and the fair value disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, expands related disclosure requirements, and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, assuming the transaction occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
There are three levels of inputs to fair value measurements - Level 1, meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, meaning the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, meaning the use of unobservable inputs. We use Level 1 inputs for fair value measurements whenever there is an active market, with actual quotes, market prices, and observable inputs on the measurement date. We use Level 2 inputs for fair value measurements whenever there are quoted prices for similar securities in an active market or quoted prices for identical securities in an inactive market. We use observable market data whenever available. We use Level 3 inputs in the Binomial Model used for the valuation of the derivative liability.
Derivative Liabilities
In accordance with ASC 815-40-25 and ASC 815-10-15 Derivatives and Hedging and ASC 480-10-25 Liabilities-Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the embedded derivatives associated with the Convertible Bonds are accounted for as liabilities during the term of the related Convertible Bonds.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table sets forth our Statements of Operations data for the years ended December 31 (all data is in thousands of USD):
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2019
Revenue. We currently have no revenue generating operations.
Operating costs and expenses. Operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $6,254,000 compared to $6,522,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in operating costs and expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily attributable to the recognition of a post impairment charge of $314,000 during the during the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $4,291,000 compared to $4,152,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily attributable to higher salary expenses offset by lower legal expenses stemming from the SEC investigation and related derivative lawsuits during 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019.
Other expenses. Other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,963,000 compared to $2,056,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other general and administrative expenses are comprised of non-compensation and non-professional expenses incurred. The decrease in other general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is primarily attributable to lower marketing expenses associated with diminished investor relations activities.
Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0 compared to $314,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in impairment of unproved oil and gas properties expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 is attributable to the impairment charge of $314,000 recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the MJ1 well.
Loss (gain) on derivative liability. Loss (gain) on derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $302,000 compared to ($216,000) for the year ended December 31, 2019. An embedded derivative is contained within the valuation of Zion’s $100 convertible bond offering which closed in March 2016. The increase in the loss on derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the gain on derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to the increase in the share price of our common stock that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other expense, net. Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $440,000 compared to $387,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Other expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to exchange rate differences associated with the fluctuating exchange rates of the New Israeli Shekels (“NIS”) with the U.S. Dollar (“USD”) and to financial expenses related to the Company’s convertible bonds.
Net Loss. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6,996,000 compared to $6,693,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver of the higher net loss in 2020 was due to loss on derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to meet potential cash requirements. As discussed above, we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common shares.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future. Our current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management’s estimates of those requirements. Should those estimates be materially incorrect, our ability to continue as a going concern will be impaired. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $11,708,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $4,845,000 at December 31, 2019. Our working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was $11,812,000 at December 31, 2020 and $5,012,000 at December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, we provided bank guarantees to various governmental bodies (approximately $1,876,000) and others (approximately $88,000) in respect of our drilling operation in the aggregate amount of approximately $1,964,000. The Company also paid $1,000,000 to its escrow agent with respect to the purchase of a drilling rig in March 2020. The (cash) funds backing these guarantees are held in restricted interest-bearing accounts and are reported on the Company’s balance sheets as fixed short-term bank deposits restricted, and fixed long-term bank deposits restricted.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities totaled $9,921,000. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $28,367,000 and is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “DSPP” or “Plan”). Net cash used in investing activities such as unproved oil and gas properties, purchase of the drilling rig, equipment and spare parts was $9,719,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Accounting standards require management to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year subsequent to the date of the filing of this Form 10-K. We expect to incur additional significant expenditures to further our exploration and development programs. While we raised approximately $2,164,000 during the period January 1, 2021 through March 22, 2021, we will need to raise additional funds in order to continue our exploration and development activities in our license area. Additionally, we estimate that, when we are not actively drilling a well, our expenditures are approximately $600,000 per month excluding exploratory operational activities. However, when we are actively drilling a well, we estimate an additional minimum expenditure of approximately $2,500,000 per month. The above estimates are subject to change. Subject to the qualifications specified below, management believes that our existing cash balance, coupled with anticipated proceeds under the DSPP, will be sufficient to finance our plan of operations through May 2021.
The recent outbreak of the coronavirus has to date significantly disrupted business operations and resulted in significantly increased unemployment in the general economy. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations, specifically our capital raising efforts, as well as our ability to continue our exploratory efforts, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.
No assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise the needed operating capital.
Even if we raise the needed funds, there are factors that can nevertheless adversely impact our ability to fund our operating needs, including (without limitation), unexpected or unforeseen cost overruns in planned non-drilling exploratory work in existing license areas, the costs associated with extended delays in undertaking the required exploratory work, and plugging and abandonment activities which is typical of what we have experienced in the past.
The financial information contained in these consolidated financial statements has been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
On March 13, 2014 Zion filed a registration statement on Form S-3 that is part of a replacement registration statement that was filed with the SEC using a “shelf” registration process. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 31, 2014. On February 23, 2017, the Company filed a Form S-3 with the SEC (Registration No. 333-216191) as a replacement for the Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-193336), for which the three year period ended March 31, 2017, along with the base Prospectus and Supplemental Prospectus. The Form S-3, as amended, and the new base Prospectus became effective on March 10, 2017, along with the Prospectus Supplement that was filed and became effective on March 10, 2017. The Prospectus Supplement under Registration No. 333-216191 describes the terms of the DSPP and replaces the prior Prospectus Supplement, as amended, under the prior Registration No. 333-193336.
On March 27, 2014, we launched our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “DSPP”) pursuant to which stockholders and interested investors can purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock as well as units of the Company’s securities directly from the Company. The terms of the DSPP are described in the Prospectus Supplement originally filed on March 31, 2014 (the “Original Prospectus Supplement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Company’s effective registration Statement on Form S-3, as thereafter amended.
On January 13, 2015, the Company amended the Original Prospectus Supplement (“Amendment No. 3”) to provide for a unit option (the “Unit Option”) under the DSPP comprised of one share of Common Stock and three Common Stock purchase warrants with each unit priced at $4.00. Each warrant afforded the participant the opportunity to purchase the Company’s Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00. Each of the three warrants series has different expiration dates that have been extended.
The ZNWAB warrants first became exercisable on May 2, 2016 and, in the case of ZNWAC on May 2, 2017 and in the case of ZNWAD on May 2, 2018, at a per share exercise price of $1.00.
As of May 2, 2017, any outstanding ZNWAB warrants expired.
As of May 2, 2018, any outstanding ZNWAC warrants expired.
On May 29, 2019, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAD Warrant by one (1) year from the expiration date of May 2, 2020 to May 2, 2021. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
On September 15, 2020, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAD Warrant by two (2) years from the expiration date of May 2, 2021 to May 2, 2023. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
On November 1, 2016, the Company launched a unit offering (the “Unit Program”) under the Company’s DSPP pursuant to which participants could purchase units comprised of seven shares of Common Stock and seven Common Stock purchase warrants, at a per unit purchase price of $10. The warrant is referred to as “ZNWAE.”
The ZNWAE warrants became exercisable on May 1, 2017 and continued to be exercisable through May 1, 2020 at a per share exercise price of $1.00.
On May 29, 2019, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAE Warrant by one (1) year from the expiration date of May 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
On September 15, 2020, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAE Warrant by two (2) years from the expiration date of May 1, 2021 to May 1, 2023. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
The warrant terms provide that if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $5.00 per share at the closing price for 15 consecutive trading days at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, the Company may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the termination of the warrant upon providing 60 days advanced notice to the warrant holders.
On May 22, 2017, the Company launched a new unit offering (the “New Unit Program”). The New Unit Program consisted of a new combination of common stock and warrants, a new time period in which to purchase under the program, and a new unit price, but otherwise the same unit program features, conditions and terms in the Prospectus Supplement applied. The New Unit Program terminated on July 12, 2017. This New Unit Program enabled participants to purchase Units of the Company’s securities where each Unit (priced at $250.00 each) was comprised of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing $250.00 (the price of one Unit) by the average of the high and low sale prices of the Company’s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ on the unit purchase date and (ii) Common Stock purchase warrants to purchase an additional 25 shares of Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant is referred to as “ZNWAF.”
All ZNWAF warrants became exercisable on August 14, 2017 and continued to be exercisable through August 14, 2020 at a per share exercise price of $1.00.
On May 29, 2019, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAF Warrant by one (1) year from the expiration date of August 14, 2020 to August 14, 2021. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
On September 15, 2020, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAF Warrant by two (2) years from the expiration date of August 14, 2021 to August 14, 2023. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
The warrant terms provide that if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $5.00 per share as the closing price for 15 consecutive trading days at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, the Company has the sole discretion to accelerate the termination date of the warrant upon providing 60 days advanced notice to the warrant holders.
An Amendment No. 2 to the Prospectus Supplement (as described below) was filed on October 12, 2017.
Under Amendment No. 2, the Company initiated another Unit Option Program which terminated on December 6, 2017. This Unit Option Program enabled participants to purchase Units of the Company’s securities where each Unit (priced at $250.00 each) was comprised of (i) a certain number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing $250.00 (the price of one Unit) by the average of the high and low sale prices of the Company’s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ on the unit purchase date and (ii) Common Stock purchase warrants to purchase an additional 15 shares of Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant is referred to as “ZNWAG.”
The warrants became exercisable on January 8, 2018 and continue to be exercisable through January 8, 2021 at a per share exercise price of $1.00. The warrant terms provide that if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $5.00 per share as the closing price for 15 consecutive trading days at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, the Company has the sole discretion to accelerate the termination date of the warrant upon providing 60 days advanced notice to the warrant holders.
On February 1, 2018, the Company launched another Unit Option Program which terminated on February 28, 2018. The Unit Option consisted of Units of our securities where each Unit (priced at $250.00 each) was comprised of (i) 50 shares of Common Stock and (ii) Common Stock purchase warrants to purchase an additional 50 shares of Common Stock.
