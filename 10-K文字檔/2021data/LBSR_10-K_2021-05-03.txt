In November 2020, the Company was approved for forgiveness in full for the entire amount including principal and interest under the PPP loan. The grant proceeds of $3,000 was factored in the amount forgiven thus $3,000 remained payable to our bank related to the PPP until the Company repaid it in February 2021.

During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, we entered into certain private investment agreements pursuant to which we received a total of $35,599 and $60,000 in net proceeds, respectively.
Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021
We had a net loss of $749,745 for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to net loss of $337,469 for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. Net loss increased by $412,276 due primarily to an increase in legal expenses of $130,094 due primarily to an increased use of legal services related to legal matters, an increase of $48,623 in geological and geophysical costs related to an increase in land rental fees for mineral claims, an increase in interest expense of $30,420 related to the change in debt balances between years, and the $177,000 gain on settlement of accounts payable during the year ended January 31, 2020. This increase is offset partially by a decrease in salaries and benefits expense of $74,675 due to a decrease in stock compensation expense and the gain on forgiveness of the SBA loan of $30,578 during the year ended January 31, 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Presentation of Financial Information
Our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 reflect financial information for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020.
Since we have not generated any revenue, we have included a reference to our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020. Our accumulated deficit on January 31, 2021, was approximately $58 million and the net loss from operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was $749,745. All of our exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized, and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
In order to continue as a going concern, we require additional financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, we would likely be unable to realize the carrying value of our assets reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. The critical accounting policies adopted by our company are as follows:
Going Concern
Since we have not generated any revenue, we have negative cash flows from operations, and negative working capital we have included a reference to the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our consolidated financial statements for the period ended January 31, 2021. Our total stockholders’ deficit at January 31, 2021 was $2,011,477.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized, and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Mineral claims
We account for costs incurred to acquire, maintain and explore mineral properties as charged to expense in the period incurred until the time that a proven mineral resource is established at which point development of the mineral property would be capitalized. Currently, we do not have any proven mineral resources on any of our mineral properties.
Convertible promissory notes
We reviewed the convertible promissory notes and the related subscription agreements to determine the appropriate reporting within the financial statements. We report convertible promissory notes as liabilities at their carrying value less unamortized discounts in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. We bifurcate conversion options and detachable common stock purchase warrants and report them as liabilities at fair value at each reporting period when required in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. No gain or loss is reported when the notes are converted into shares of our common stock in accordance with the note’s terms.
Common stock purchase warrants
We report common stock purchase warrants as equity unless a condition exists which requires reporting as a derivative liability at fair market value. The valuation of the derivative liability of the warrants is determined through the use of a Monte Carlo options model that values the liability of the warrants based on a risk-neutral valuation where the price of the option is its discounted expected value.
