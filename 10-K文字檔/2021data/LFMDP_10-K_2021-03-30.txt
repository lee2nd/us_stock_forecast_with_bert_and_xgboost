Developments in 2020
Key developments in our business during 2020 are described below:
Financing Transactions
Beginning May 21, 2020 through May 27, 2020, we issued convertible promissory notes (the “May 2020 Notes”) to five (5) accredited investors (each a “May 2020 Investor”, and collectively, the “May 2020 Investors”). The aggregate principal amount of the May 2020 Notes is $1,000,000 for which we received gross proceeds of $1,000,000. The May 2020 Notes may be converted into shares of our common stock at any time following the date of issuance at a conversion price of $2.50 per share, subject to adjustment. During the week ended November 6, 2020, all accredited investors agreed to convert the May 2020 Notes (the “Note Conversions”) pursuant to the terms therein. On November 24, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 447,763 shares of common stock related to the Note Conversions at $2.50 per share.
In May 2020, we issued 294,120 shares of common stock to an investor for $250,000 in cash consideration.
5,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock was established on August 27, 2020. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock have a stated value of $1,000 per share (the “Series B Stated Value”) and are convertible into Common Stock at the election of the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock, at a price of $3.25 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Conversion Price”). Each holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding and held by such holder, dividends at the rate of thirteen percent (13%) per annum.
On August 28, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with an accredited investor, to purchase from us an aggregate of 3,500 units (the “Units”), at a purchase price of $1,000 per Unit, each consisting of (i) one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and (ii) a warrant to purchase 400 shares of common stock of the Company. As a result of the Purchase Agreement, we recorded a deemed dividend to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock of $3,500,000 for the value of the warrants and beneficial conversion feature in excess of the purchase price. Additionally, we recorded accrued dividend of $155,822 for the Series B Preferred Stock 13% dividend feature.
In September 2020, we received aggregate proceeds of $25,000 for the sale of warrants from the Warrant Purchase Agreement.
On October 9, 2020, we effectuated a 1-for-5 reverse stock split (the “Stock Split”) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock that became effective in the market on October 14, 2020.
On November 3, 2020, we consummated an initial closing of a private placement offering (the “Offering”), whereby pursuant to the securities purchase agreement (the “November Purchase Agreement”) entered into by the Company and certain accredited investors on October 30, 2020 (each an “Investor” and collectively, the “Investors”) we sold to such Investors an aggregate of 3,044,529 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $14,461,513 (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price was funded on November 3, 2020 and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $13.5 million.
On November 19, 2020, we consummated the second and final closing of the Offering, whereby pursuant to the November Purchase Agreement entered into by us and the accredited investor on November 19, 2020, we sold to such accredited investor 323,892 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock for a purchase price of $1,538,487 which was funded on November 19, 2020 and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.4 million. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering was $16,000,000, or approximately $14.9 million, net of offering related expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 534,774 shares of common stock related to the cashless exercise of options.

Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenue
Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 are summarized as follows in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019:
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $37.3 million, an increase of 199% compared to approximately $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenues was attributable to both the increase in product revenue of 208% and an increase in software revenue of 165%. Product revenue accounts for 82% of total revenue and has increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to an increase in online sales demand, with the majority of the growth of our telemedicine brands, RexMD and ShapiroMD. Software revenue accounts for 18% of total revenue and has steadily increased year over year due to a combination of higher demand, increased market awareness, enhanced digital capabilities and continued marketing campaign expansion. While a portion of our growth could be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, management strongly believes our growth is primarily a result of the strength of our healthcare brands.
Total cost of revenues consists of the cost of (1) product revenues, which primarily include product material costs and fulfillment costs directly attributable to the production of our products held for sale and (2) the cost of software revenue consisting primarily of information technology fees related to providing the services made available on our online platform. Total cost of revenue increased by approximately 252% to approximately $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The combined cost of increase was due to increased product costs related to our improved product sale volumes when compared to the prior year’s period ended December 31, 2019.
Gross profit increased by approximately 185% to approximately $28.4 million for the year ended December 31,2020 compared to approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of increased combined sales, partially offset by a percentage increases in our costs to produce product revenues. Product costs increased to 23% of associated product revenues experienced during the year ended December 31, 2020, from 19% of associated product revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 76% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 80% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of 4% in gross profit was principally attributable to higher product costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting from the use of new suppliers, at slightly higher costs, resulting from the impact of COVID-19 related disruptions to our product supply chain, causing increased costs to procure our production inputs. The new suppliers were also required to supplement our increased production needs to meet our increased product demand.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $86.2 million, as compared to approximately $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This represents an increase of 573%, or $73.4 million. The increase is primarily attributable to:
(i) Selling and marketing expenses: This mainly consists of online marketing and advertising expenses, as well as merchant processing fees. During the year ended December 31,2020, the Company had an increase of approximately $32.8 million, or 367% in selling and marketing costs resulting from additional sales and marketing initiatives to drive the current year ended December 31, 2020 sales growth reported above and is expected to maintain sustained revenue growth in future years, based on the Company’s recurring revenue subscription-based sales model.
(ii) General and administrative expenses: During the year period ended December 31, 2020, stock-based compensation was $37.0 million, (1) with the majority related to stock compensation expense attributable to the attainment of a performance threshold in the period, (2) coupled with the issuance expense associated with the probability of future performance threshold attainment. This category also consists of payroll expenses for executive management, amortization expense and legal and professional fees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has had an increase of approximately $39.8 million in general and administrative expenses, primarily related to the increase in stock-based compensation costs referenced above, and other increases in infrastructure expenses incurred to support the sales volume increases.
(iii) Other operating expenses: This consists of rent, insurance, royalty expense, bank charges and IT services for our online products. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an increase of approximately $442,000, or 61%, primarily related to increases in the general cost environment necessary to support the Company’s sales growth, as well as a bad debt charge of approximately $133,000 in 2020.
(iv) Customer service expenses: This consists of payroll and benefit expenses related to the Company’s customer service department located in Puerto Rico and South Carolina. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an increase of approximately $146,000, primarily related to increases in headcount in the Company’s customer service department.
(v) Development costs: This mainly relates to third-party technology services for developing and maintaining our online platforms. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an increase of approximately $224,000, primarily resulting from technology platform improvements for LegalSimpli and amortization expenses at CLPR.
Other Expenses
Other expense, which consists of interest expense and loss on debt settlement, for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in other expense, interest expense, is primarily attributable to the increased use of debt during 2020 and the acceleration of debt discount in 2020 of $500,145. Loss on debt settlement is attributable to the issuance of common share and warrant in exchange for debt during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Working Capital
Working capital (deficit) increased by only $198,361 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in current assets is primarily attributable to an increase in cash of approximately $8.1 million, an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $551,000, and inventory and product deposits (combined increase of approximately $981,000). Current liabilities increased by $9.5 million which was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of the Company extending payables and credit terms with vendors during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, the Company has funded operations through the collections from revenues provided by the sales of its products, issuances of common and preferred stock , receipt of loans and advances from officers and directors and the issuance of convertible notes to third-party investors.
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $251,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The significant factors contributing to the cash used in operations during the year ended December 31, 2020, include the net loss of approximately $60.5 million (inclusive of $37.0 million in non-cash stock based compensation charges), principally offset by the Company’s increase in accounts payable of approximately $9.5 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $798,000, as compared with net cash used in investing activities of $100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to continued payments on the Company’s purchase of LegalSimpli of $400,000 and the cash paid for capitalized software costs of approximately $398,000.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $21.0 million as compared with net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $775,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities consisted of net proceeds from private placement of $14.9 million, cash proceeds from issuance of Series B Preferred Stock of $2.9 million, cash proceeds from notes payable of $2.4 million, cash proceeds from the sale of common stock of $2.3 million, cash proceeds from the sales of warrants of $622,763 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately $300,000, which were offset primarily by the repayment of notes payable of approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook
The Company has funded operations in the past through the sales of its products, issuance of common stock and through loans and advances from officers and directors. The Company’s continued operations are dependent upon obtaining an increase in its sale volumes which the company has been successful in achieving to date. See Note 5 for a further discussion of a private placement offering, which closed on November 3, 2020, with final closing on November 19, 2020, yielding $16 million in gross proceeds to the Company before deduction of placement fees and other offering expenses, resulting in $14.9 million in net proceeds. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for customer acquisition, as well as for general corporate purposes.
Additionally, on February 11, 2021, the Company consummated the closing of a private placement offering (See Note 10) yielding gross proceeds of $14,000,008, and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $13.4 million after deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company records revenue under the adoption of ASC 606 by analyzing exchanges with its customers using a five-step analysis:
1. Identify the contract
2. Identify performance obligations
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction price
5. Recognize revenue
For the Company’s product-based contracts with customers, the Company has determined that there is one performance obligation, which is the delivery of the product; this performance obligation is transferred at a discrete point in time. The Company generally records sales of finished products once the customer places and pays for the order, with the product being simultaneously shipped by a third-party fulfillment service provider; in limited cases, title does not pass until the product reaches the customer’s delivery site, in these limited cases, recognition of revenue should be deferred until that time, however the Company does not have a process to properly record the recognition of revenue if orders are not immediately shipped, and deems the impact to be immaterial. In all cases, delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, which is usually commensurate upon shipment of the product. In the case of its product-based contracts, the Company provides a subscription sensitive service based on the recurring shipment of products and records the related revenue under the subscription agreements subsequent to receiving the monthly product order, recording the revenue at the time it fulfills the shipment obligation to the customer.
For its product-based contracts with customers, the Company records an estimate for provisions of discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments for its product shipments, and are reflected as contra revenues in arriving at reported net revenues. The Company’s discounts and customer rebates are known at the time of sale, correspondingly, the Company reduces gross product sales for such discounts and customer rebates. The Company estimates customer returns and allowances based on information derived from historical transaction detail, and accounts for such provisions, as contra revenue, during the same period in which the related revenues are earned. The Company has determined that the population of its product-based contracts with customers are homogenous, supporting the ability to record estimates for returns and allowances to be applied to the entire product-based portfolio population.
The Company, through its majority-owned subsidiary LegalSimpli, offers a subscription based service providing a suite of software applications to its subscribers, principally on a monthly subscription basis. The software suite allows the subscriber/user to convert almost any type of document to another electronic form of editable document, providing ease of editing. For these subscription-based contracts with customers, the Company offers an initial 14-day trial period which is billed at $1.95, followed by a monthly subscription, or a yearly subscription to the Company’s software suite dependent on the subscriber’s enrollment selection. The Company has estimated that there is one product and one performance obligation that is delivered over time, as the Company allows the subscriber to access the suite of services for the time period of the subscription purchased. The Company allows the customer to cancel at any point during the billing cycle, in which case the customers subscription will not be renewed for the following month or year depending on the original subscription. The Company records the revenue over the customers subscription period for monthly and yearly subscribers or at the end of the initial 14 day service period for customers who purchased the initial subscription, as the circumstances dictate. The Company offers a discount for the monthly or yearly subscriptions being purchased, which is deducted at the time of payment at the initiation of the contract term, therefore the Contract price is fixed and determinable at the contract initiation. Monthly and annual subscriptions for the service are recorded net of the Company’s known discount rates. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company has accrued contract liabilities, as deferred revenue, of approximately $917,000 and $110,000, respectively, which represent obligations on in-process monthly or yearly contracts with customers and a portion attributable to the yet to be recognized initial 14-day trial period collections.
Customer discounts, returns and rebates on product revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 approximated $3.3 million and $1.29 million, respectively. Customer discounts and allowances on software revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 approximated $1,062,000 and $241,000, respectively.
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes certain internal payroll costs and third-party costs related to internally developed software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years. The Company does not sell internally developed software other than through the use of subscription service. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 350-40 Internal-Use Software, are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized $438,136 and $0 related to internally developed software costs which is amortized over the useful life and included in development costs on our statement of operations.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are comprised of a customer relationship asset and purchased license with an estimated useful life of three years and ten years, respectively. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives using the straight-line method. Costs incurred to renew or extend the term of recognized intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the asset.
Income Taxes
The Company files corporate federal and state tax returns. Conversion Labs PR and LegalSimpli file tax returns in Puerto Rico, both are limited liability companies and file separate tax returns with any tax liabilities or benefits passing through to its members.
The Company records current and deferred taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This ASC requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the consolidated financial statements, based upon the enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company periodically assesses the value of its deferred tax asset, a majority of which has been generated by a history of net operating losses and management determines the necessity for a valuation allowance. ASC 740 also provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Using this guidance, a company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in its financial statements only if it is more likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company’s tax returns for all years since December 31, 2016, remain open to audit by all related taxing authorities.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, “Share-Based Payment”. Under this guidance compensation cost generally is recognized at fair value on the date of the grant and amortized over the respective vesting or service period. The fair value of options at the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected option life is derived from assumed exercise rates based upon historical exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company’s common stock shares using weekly price observations over an observation period that approximates the expected life of the options. The risk-free rate approximates the U.S. Treasury yield curve rate in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected option life. Due to limited history of forfeitures, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.
Many of the assumptions require significant judgment and any changes could have a material impact in the determination of stock-based compensation expense.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features” (“ASU 2017-11”). Equity-linked instruments, such as warrants, and convertible instruments may contain down round features that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Under ASU 2017-11, a down round feature will no longer require a freestanding equity-linked instrument (or embedded conversion option) to be classified as a liability that is remeasured at fair value through the income statement (i.e. marked-to-market). However, other features of the equity-linked instrument (or embedded conversion option) must still be evaluated to determine whether liability or equity classification is appropriate. Equity classified instruments are not marked-to-market. For earnings per share (“EPS”) reporting, the ASU requires companies to recognize the effect of the down round feature only when it is triggered by treating it as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard was adopted on January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Application of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Not Yet Adopted
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40); Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”)”, which addresses issues identified as a result of the complexities associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This update addresses, among other things, the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share (“EPS”) guidance and amendments to the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity, as well as the related EPS guidance. This update applies to all entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts in an entity’s own equity. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. FASB specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year, or January 1, 2021, should the Company elect to early adopt. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 could have on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
