The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (this “MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other disclosures included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this MD&A, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the information contained in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this MD&A.
Overview
We offer responsible consumer credit through our A.I.-driven digital platform at a lower cost compared to market alternatives available to individuals that are not well served by the financial mainstream. In our 15-year lending history, we have originated more than 4.1 million loans, representing over $9.8 billion of credit extended, to more than 1.8 million customers. We have developed a deep data-driven understanding of our customers' needs through a combination of the rigorous application of machine learning, the use of alternative data sets and continuous customer engagement. We have been certified as a Community Development Financial Institution ("CDFI") by the U.S. Department of the Treasury since 2009.
Our core offering is a simple-to-understand, affordable, unsecured, fully amortizing personal installment loan with fixed payments and fixed interest rates throughout the life of the loan. Our personal loans do not have prepayment penalties or balloon payments and range in size from $300 to $10,000 with terms ranging from six to 51 months. As part of our commitment to be a responsible lender, we verify income for 100% of our personal loan customers and only make loans to customers that our ability-to-pay model indicates should be able to afford a loan after meeting their other debts and regular living expenses. We execute our sales and marketing strategy through a variety of acquisition channels including our digital platform, retail locations, direct mail and digital marketing, and partnerships. We also benefit from customers learning about Oportun from friends or family members and other word-of-mouth referrals. Our omni-channel network enables us to serve our customers in the way they prefer and when it is convenient for them, online, over-the-phone, and in person. We have seen our customers' usage and preference for our digital channels accelerate during 2020 and we are continuing to invest in our digital origination and servicing platform, as well as building out customer self-service capabilities. Our personal loan serves as an alternative to high-cost installment, auto title, payday and pawn lenders. According to the Financial Health Network study that we commissioned, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2020, our customers have saved more than $1.8 billion in aggregate interest and fees compared to alternative products available to them.
Through our recently announced partnership with MetaBank, N.A,, a national bank, we will be able to offer a uniform product across the nation, while minimizing operational complexity and generating cost savings that can be passed on to our customers. We plan to offer loan products that are the same as our unsecured personal loans with APRs capped at 36%. We are currently working on the technology that will enable the rollout of our MetaBank, N.A. partnership by mid-2021. In November 2020, we began the application process to obtain a national bank charter.
Beyond our core direct-to-consumer lending business, we believe that our proprietary credit scoring and underwriting model can be offered as a service to other companies. This Lending as a Service model is currently being piloted with our strategic partner, DolEx. In this partnership, DolEx will market loans and enter customer applications into Oportun’s system, and Oportun will underwrite, originate and service the loans. If successful, we believe we will be able to offer Lending as a Service to additional partners and thereby expand our reach into new consumer markets.
We have begun expanding beyond our core offering of unsecured installment loans into other financial services that a significant portion of our customers already use and have asked us to provide, such as auto loans and credit cards. We launched the Oportun Visa Credit Card, issued by WebBank, Member FDIC, in 2019 and offered credit cards in 33 states as of December 31, 2020. In April 2020, we launched a personal installment loan secured by an automobile, which we refer to as secured personal loans.
The map below show the states in which we offer our products as of December 31, 2020.
To fund our growth at a low and efficient cost, we have built a diversified and well-established capital markets funding program, which allows us to partially hedge our exposure to rising interest rates or credit spreads by locking in our interest expense for up to three years. Over the past seven years, we have executed 14 bond offerings in the asset-backed securities market, the last 11 of which include tranches that have been rated investment grade. We issued two- and three-year fixed rate bonds which have provided us committed capital to fund future loan originations at a fixed Cost of Debt. In November 2014, we entered into a whole loan sale agreement with an institutional investor, which agreement has been amended from time to time. The term of the current agreement was set to expire on November 10, 2020. The parties have agreed to extend the agreement on the same terms through February 26, 2021. Additional extensions may be considered on a month-to-month basis. Pursuant to this agreement, we have committed to sell at least 10% of our unsecured loan originations, with an option to sell an additional 5%, subject to certain eligibility criteria and minimum and maximum volumes. In addition, from July 2017 to August 2020, we were party to a separate whole loan sale arrangement with an institutional investor providing for a commitment to sell 100% of our loans originated under our loan program for customers who do not meet the qualifications of our core loan origination program. We chose not to renew the arrangement and allowed the agreement to expire on its terms on August 5, 2020. In addition to our whole loan sale program, we also have a $400.0 million Secured Financing facility committed through October 2021, which also helps to fund our loan portfolio growth. In October 2020 we raised $39.8 million, net of fees and expenses, by selling $41.3 million of retained bonds related to our 2019-A and 2018-B asset-backed notes.
We closely manage our operating expenses, which consist of technology and facilities, sales and marketing, personnel, outsourcing and professional fees and general, administrative and other expenses, with the goal of increasing investments in our data analytics, technology and mobile-first experiences, and our digital marketing capabilities.
We previously elected the fair value option to account for all loans receivable held for investment that were originated on or after January 1, 2018 (the "Initial Fair Value Loans"), and for all asset-backed notes issued on or after January 1, 2018 (the "Fair Value Notes"). As compared to the loans held for investment that were originated prior to January 1, 2018 (the "Loans Receivable at Amortized Cost"), we believe the fair value option enables us to report GAAP net income that more closely approximates our net cash flow generation and provides increased transparency into our profitability and asset quality. Loans Receivable at Amortized Cost issued prior to January 1, 2018 are accounted for in our 2019 financial statements at amortized cost, net. Upon adoption of ASU 2019-05 effective January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on all remaining loans receivable previously measured at amortized cost (the "Subsequent Fair Value Loans," and together with the Initial Fair Value Loans, the "Fair Value Loans"). Upon adoption of ASU 2019-05 effective January 1, 2020, we (i) released the remaining allowance for loan losses on Loan Receivables at Amortized Cost as of December 31, 2019; (ii) recognized the unamortized net originations fee income as of December 31, 2019; and (iii) measured the remaining loans originated prior to January 1, 2018 at fair value. Loans that we designate for sale are accounted for as held for sale and recorded at
the lower of cost or fair value until the loans receivable are sold. Asset-backed notes issued prior to January 1, 2018 are accounted for in our financial statements at amortized cost, net. After the redemption of our Series 2017-B asset-back notes on July 8, 2020, we no longer have any asset-backed notes at amortized cost as of December 31, 2020. We estimate the fair value of the Fair Value Loans using a discounted cash flow model, which considers various factors such as the price that we could sell our loans to a third party in a non-public market, credit risk, net charge-offs, customer payment rates and market conditions such as interest rates. We estimate the fair value of our Fair Value Notes based upon the prices at which our or similar asset-backed notes trade. We reevaluate the fair value of our Fair Value Loans and our Fair Value Notes at the close of each measurement period.
Retail Network Optimization
During the past few years, we have seen a growing customer preference for our online and mobile channels. After a careful analysis of our customer trends and the overlapping geographic footprint of certain existing retail locations, we are planning to close 136 retail locations and implement a workforce reduction of certain employees who manage and operate the retail locations. By optimizing our retail channel, we estimate we will generate projected operating expense savings of approximately $19 million per year, after one-time charges. As customers have increasingly shifted to mobile and we are broadening our partners channel, we are planning to invest in the technology to continue to enhance our mobile channel and digital platform. We expect that we can continue to serve our existing customer base and scale to serve new customers with a more efficient retail footprint. For additional information, see Note 16, Subsequent Events, to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
COVID-19 Update
We continue to monitor and proactively navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, taking actions to manage our business in a thoughtful and conservative manner throughout this fluid situation, while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. The actions taken since the beginning of the pandemic have resulted in improving credit trends, steadily increasing originations, and a continued strong balance sheet. We believe we remain well-positioned strategically and financially in the current environment, however, factors such as economic conditions, the unemployment rate, and further stimulus measures may impact our future performance. As of December 31, 2020, 99% of our retail locations were open to serve customers. While we recognize and still believe that our retail channel is a key differentiator in our customer experience, a shift from in-store to mobile was occurring gradually prior to 2020. The pandemic further accelerated the adoption of our digital channels, and we believe that for many of our customers, this shift will be permanent. Our investment in digital capabilities gives us a path for continued growth in a more capital efficient manner. In the fourth quarter of 2020, 65% of new applicants chose to apply online, up from 46% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, 73% of all payments were made outside of our stores whereas this figure was 60% as of December 31, 2019.
Improving Credit Trends
Deferrals We believe that our rapid implementation of emergency hardship programs and reduced payment plans have been effective in providing impacted customers sufficient time to return to repayment status. We may consider Emergency Hardship Deferrals, granted one month at a time, for borrowers who continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, 1.4% of our Owned Principal Balance at End of Period was in active deferral status under the Emergency Hardship Deferral program, down from a peak of 14.6% at the end of April 2020. We believe that our customers are currently managing through the crisis and most have returned to repayment status.
Delinquencies We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 with a 30+ Day Delinquency Rate of 3.7%, compared to 4.0% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Borrowers who are less than 30 days delinquent when they received an Emergency Hardship Deferral are counted at zero days delinquent, and customers that were more than 30 days delinquent continue to be in the same delinquency status as they were prior to receiving an Emergency Hardship Deferral. As a standard practice, we offer a grace period ranging between 7 and 15 days before a late fee is assessed, allowing customers extra time to make a payment if needed. We monitor our early stage delinquencies very closely and attempt to contact delinquent customers before the grace period expires to provide them with payment options.

Net Charge-Offs Our Annualized Net Charge-Off Rate for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 was 9.4%, down from 10.4% for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. Consistent with our charge-off policy, we evaluate our loan portfolio and charge a loan off at the earlier of when the loan is determined to be uncollectible or when loans are 120 days contractually past due. As a result of the pandemic and based upon our analysis of loan performance following natural disasters or other emergencies, more loans have been determined to be uncollectible prior to reaching 120 days contractually past due, resulting in $6.3 million and $21.6 million of higher charge-offs for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.
Steadily Increasing Originations
Loan originations in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 increased 48.3% as compared to the third quarter ended September 30, 2020 due to increasing approval rates, the refinement of our marketing efforts, including increased digital initiatives and optimization of direct mail, and by maintaining the availability of our omni-channel network. We have seen a rebound in originations following the decline that began in the second-half of March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Originations for the month of December 2020 were down 28% year over year; however, we have seen steady improvement in each month following the low in April 2020.
Credit Trends of New Originations
Due to our credit tightening in mid-March, loans originated after that time had First Payment Defaults below pre-pandemic levels. Based upon this performance, we prudently increased our approval rates in mid-June and have focused on increasing approval rates for our returning customers. First Payment Defaults on newly-originated loans are normalizing to 2019 levels. We calculate First Payment Defaults, shown below, as the principal balance of any loan whose first payment becomes 30 days past due, divided by the aggregate principal balance of all loans originated during that same week. We regard First Payment Defaults to be an early indicator of credit performance as the outstanding principal balance of loans that have their first payment past due are regarded as more likely to default and result in a charge off. We continue to monitor the external environment and intend to continue to adjust approval rates, verification procedures and loan sizes accordingly.
Owned Principal Balance at December 31, 2020 was $1.64 billion, which was up from $1.57 billion at September 30, 2020. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in originations due to higher application and approval rates compared to last quarter. Average Daily Principal Balance for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020 was $1.61 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively.
Impact on Net Change in Fair Value
Our net increase or decrease in fair value, {or "net change in fair value"), includes our current period principal net charge-offs and mark-to-market adjustments on our Fair Value Loans and our Fair Value Notes.
The fair value of our Loans Receivable at Fair Value increased $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the third quarter of 2020 driven by an increase in the fair value price of our loans from 101.9% as of September 30, 2020 to 103.5% as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the fair value price of our loans is due to (a) a decrease in the discount rate from 7.84% as of September 30, 2020 to 6.85% as of December 31, 2020 caused by declining interest rates and credit spreads, (b) a decrease in remaining cumulative charge-offs from 10.61% as of September 30, 2020 to 10.03% as of December 31, 2020 due to customers returning to repayment, and (c) an increase in average life from 0.77 years as of September 30, 2020 to 0.80 years as of December 31, 2020 due to longer terms for our returning customers.
The fair value of our Asset-Backed Notes at Fair Value decreased $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the third quarter of 2020 driven by a slight increase in the weighted average price of our asset-backed notes from 101.10% at September 30, 2020 to 101.12% as of December 31, 2020.
Investment in New Products
We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 with $5.7 million of credit card receivables issued through a partner bank, with our credit card product available in 33 states. In addition, we ended the fourth quarter of 2020 with $6.0 million of auto loans. In November 2020, we decided to cease originating direct auto loans used to purchase a vehicle. We continue to invest in developing our secured personal loan product following the launch of the pilot of this new product in the second quarter of 2020. We believe that secured personal loans will complement our unsecured product and provide us with the opportunity to serve additional customers and offer larger loans. In the near term we expect to continue to make investments in both our credit card and secured personal loan products to expand the features and availability of these offerings.
COVID-19 Expenses
Our top priority throughout the crisis has been protecting the health, safety and welfare of our employees and customers. As a result, the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 includes approximately $0.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in COVID-19 expenses for items and services including sanitation kits, facilities equipment, contingency call center, payment option flyers, childcare relief, special medical enrollment, sick leave, emergency assistance fund and charitable contributions. The COVID-19 expenses were separable from our normal business operations and are not expected to recur once the pandemic subsides. These one-time COVID-19 related expenses are included in our adjustments to derive our Non-GAAP measures and our business practices have been updated to operate in the current environment. As such, we expect no further COVID-19 related adjustments in future periods.
Capital and Liquidity
Our balance sheet is characterized by relatively low leverage, and our term securitizations and warehouse line are non-recourse to Oportun Financial Corporation and our operating subsidiaries. Our term securitizations allow us to fund new loan originations for the remainder of each securitization’s revolving period. To provide sufficient collateral to maintain our outstanding low-cost securitization bonds, on July 8, 2020, the issuer redeemed all $200.0 million of outstanding Series 2017-B asset-backed notes. The revolving periods for the remaining securitizations have end
dates which range from February 2021 to July 2022. In October 2020, due to the strong market demand for asset-backed notes, we raised $39.8 million, net of fees and expenses, by selling $41.3 million of retained bonds related to our 2019-A and 2018-B asset-backed securitizations.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $168.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash with $438.2 million of Adjusted Tangible Book Value. Additionally, our business generated $152.9 million of cash from operations in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had $153.0 million undrawn capacity on our $400.0 million warehouse line that is committed through October 2021. Based upon our recent projections, we have determined that we have more than 12 months of liquidity runway.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. See "Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Key Financial and Operating Metrics
We monitor and evaluate the following key metrics in order to measure our current performance, develop and refine our growth strategies, and make strategic decisions.
For a presentation of the actual impact of the election of the fair value option for the periods presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report, please see the next section, "Non-GAAP Financial Measures". The Fair Value Pro Forma information is presented in that section because it is non-GAAP presentation.
The following table and related discussion set forth key financial and operating metrics for our operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For similar financial and operating metrics and discussion of the our 2019 results compared to our 2018 results, refer to Part II. Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020 (File No. 001-39050).
See “Glossary” at the beginning of this report for formulas and definitions of our key performance metrics.
Aggregate Originations
Aggregate Originations decreased to $1.35 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 34.3% decrease. The decrease is primarily driven by a reduced number of applications attributable both to increased economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a redirection of our marketing efforts. Further, the decrease is due to the reduced number of loans originated attributable to the proactive measures we implemented to tighten our lending criteria and underwriting practices given the current COVID-19 pandemic. We originated 449,362 and 726,964 loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a decrease of 38.2%. The decrease in Aggregate Originations was partially offset by an increase in average loan size, as our updated underwriting criteria favors returning customers who generally receive larger loans.
Active Customers
As of December 31, 2020, Active Customers decreased by 17.9% from December 31, 2019 due to lower originations as a result of a reduction in application volume attributable to economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, tightened lending criteria and underwriting practices, as well as a redirection in marketing efforts.
Customer Acquisition Cost
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our Customer Acquisition Cost was $199 and $134 respectively, representing an increase of 48.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to the decline in number of loans originated period over period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase is partially offset by the lower sales and marketing expenses due to the temporary redeployment of retail employees to assist with customer service, which concluded August 31, 2020, and the reduction in direct mail volume due to the redirection of our marketing efforts.
Managed Principal Balance at End of Period
Managed Principal Balance at End of Period as of December 31, 2020 decreased by 13.8% from December 31, 2019 driven by fewer loans originated year-over-year. This decline is a result of a reduced number of applications attributable both to increased economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the proactive measures we implemented to tighten our lending criteria and underwriting practices, as well as a redirection of our marketing efforts.
Average Daily Principal Balance
Average Daily Principal Balance increased by 4.8% from $1.62 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily driven by increases in average loan size and growth in originations prior to the issuance of shelter in place orders which began in March 2020 as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in Aggregate Originations, which has declined due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
30+ Day Delinquency Rate
Our 30+ Day Delinquency Rate was 3.7% and 4.0% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease is due to the effectiveness of our collections tools and payment options that have helped our customers manage through the pandemic as well as tighter underwriting criteria for loans originated since the pandemic began.
Annualized Net Charge-Off Rate
Annualized Net Charge-Off Rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 9.8% and 8.3%, respectively. Net charge-offs increased due to both increased unemployment caused by the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and additional charge-offs for some loans impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic deemed unlikely to be collectible. Consistent with our charge-off policy, we evaluate our loan portfolio and charge a loan off at the earlier of when the loan is determined to be uncollectible or when loans are 120 days contractually past due. As a result of the pandemic and based upon our analysis of loan performance following natural disasters or other emergencies, more loans have been determined to be uncollectible prior to reaching 120 days contractually past due, resulting in $21.6 million of higher charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Operating Efficiency and Adjusted Operating Efficiency
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Operating Efficiency was 67.4%, and 60.4%, respectively and Adjusted Operating Efficiency was 61.1% and 57.2%, respectively. The increase in Operating Efficiency is due to operating expenses growing faster than total revenue. Increased operating expenses were driven by $21.9 million in investments in new products, as well as accelerated investments in new products and channels, technology, data and digital capabilities. Adjusted Operating Efficiency excludes COVID-19 expenses, stock-based compensation expense and litigation reserve. For a reconciliation of Operating Efficiency to Adjusted Operating Efficiency, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Fair Value Pro Forma.”
Return on Equity and Adjusted Return on Equity
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Return on Equity was (9.4)% and 14.7%, respectively, and Adjusted Return on Equity was (3.0)% and 14.9%, respectively. The decreases in Return on Equity and Adjusted Return on Equity are primarily due to lower net income. Net income was lower due to higher charge-offs and the decrease in fair value of our Far Value Loans and Fair Value Notes on an aggregate basis as a result of macro-economic changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For a reconciliation of Return on Equity to Adjusted Return on Equity, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Fair Value Pro Forma.”
Historical Credit Performance
In addition to monitoring our loss and delinquency performance on an owned portfolio basis, we also monitor the performance of our loans by the period in which the loan was disbursed, generally years or quarters, which we refer to as a vintage. We calculate net lifetime loan loss rate by vintage as a percentage of original principal balance. Net lifetime loan loss rates equal the net lifetime loan losses for a given year through December 31, 2020 divided by the total origination loan volume for that year. Loans are charged off no later than after becoming 120 days contractually delinquent.
The below table shows our net lifetime loan loss rate for each annual vintage since we began lending in 2006. We have managed to stabilize cumulative net lifetime loan losses since the financial crisis that started in 2008. We even achieved a net lifetime loan loss rate of 5.5% during the peak of the recession in 2009. The evolution of our credit models has allowed us to increase our average loan size and commensurately extend our average loan terms. Cumulative net lifetime loan losses for the 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 vintages increased partially due to the delay in tax
refunds in 2017 and 2019, the impact of natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey, and the longer duration of the loans. The 2018 and 2019 vintages are increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The chart below includes all personal loan originations by vintage, excluding loans originated under our previous access loan program for customers who do not meet the qualifications of our core loan origination program.
* Vintage is not yet fully mature from a loss perspective.
Results of Operations

Total Revenue. Total revenue decreased by $16.4 million, or 2.7%, from $600.1 million for 2019 to $583.7 million for 2020.
Interest income. Total interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 0.2%, from $544.1 million for 2019 to $545.5 million for 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in our Average Daily Principal Balance, which grew from $1.62 billion for 2019 to $1.70 billion for 2020, an increase of 4.8%. The increase is the result of the stabilization of the portfolio subsequent to the issuance of shelter in place orders which began in March 2020 as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and a strong rebound in originations beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through year-end. This was offset by a decrease in portfolio yield of 143 basis points as we originated more loans to returning customers, who generally receive lower rates, due to having tightened our underwriting criteria in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our decision to cap the APR at 36% on all new originations as of August 6, 2020, which reduced the interest rates and origination fees on new loans.
Non-interest income. Total non-interest income decreased by $17.8 million, or 31.7%, from $56.0 million for 2019 to $38.3 million for 2020. Under our whole loan sale programs, gain on loans sold decreased by $16.2 million, or 44.4% due to a decline in loans sold resulting from lower originations as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our decision to sell 10% versus 15% of originated loans.
See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Revenue, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion on our interest income, non-interest income and revenue.
Interest expense
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by $2.2 million, or 3.6%, from $60.5 million for 2019 to $58.4 million for 2020. We financed approximately 83.8% of our loans receivable through debt for 2020 as compared to 85.5% for 2019, and our Average Daily Debt Balance increased from $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion for 2020, an increase of 2.7%. Our Cost of Debt has decreased as interest rates have declined since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information on our Interest expense and the our Secured Financing facility and asset-backed notes.
Provision (release) for loan losses
Upon adoption of ASU 2019-05, effective January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on all loans receivable previously measured at amortized cost as of December 31, 2019. There is no provision for loan losses for the Fair Value Loans because lifetime loan losses are incorporated in the measurement of fair value for loans receivable. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not have any loans receivable measured at amortized cost and, therefore, the provision (release) for loan losses is not applicable for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Total net increase (decrease) in fair value
Net increase (decrease) in fair value reflects changes in fair value of Fair Value Loans and Fair Value Notes on an aggregate basis and is based on a number of factors, including benchmark interest rates, credit spreads, remaining cumulative charge-offs and customer payment rates. Increases in the fair value of loans increase Net Revenue. Conversely, decreases in the fair value of loans decrease Net Revenue. Increases in the fair value of asset-backed notes decrease Net Revenue. Decreases in the fair value of asset-backed notes increase Net Revenue.
* Not meaningful
(1) The loan related balances are not comparable between 2020 and 2019 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2019-05, effective January 2020.
Net increase (decrease) in fair value. Net decrease in fair value for 2020 was $190.3 million. This amount represents a total fair value mark-to-market decrease of $23.4 million, and $166.9 million of charge-offs, net of recoveries on Fair Value Loans. The total fair value mark-to-market adjustment consists of a $(25.5) million mark-to-market adjustment on Fair Value Loans due to (a) an increase in remaining cumulative charge-offs from 9.61% as of December 31, 2019 to 10.03% as of December 31, 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic, partially offset by (b) a decrease in the discount rate from 7.77% as of December 31, 2019 to 6.85% as of December 31, 2020 caused by declining interest rates and credit spreads and (c) a slight decrease in average life from 0.81 years as of December 31, 2019 to 0.80 years as of December 31, 2020. The $2.1 million mark-to-market adjustment on Fair Value Notes is due to a widening of credit spreads due to illiquidity and increase in risk premiums in the secondary market for asset-backed notes due to the pandemic.
Charge-offs, net of recoveries
* Not meaningful
(1) The loan related balances are not comparable between 2020 and 2019 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2019-05, effective January 2020.
Charge-offs, net of recoveries.
Our Annualized Net Charge-Off Rate increased to 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consistent with our charge-off policy, we evaluate our loan portfolio and charge a loan off at the earlier of when the loan is determined to be uncollectible or when loans are 120 days contractually past due. As a result of the pandemic and based upon our analysis of loan performance following natural disasters or other emergencies, more loans have been determined to be uncollectible prior to reaching 120 days contractually past due, resulting in $21.6 million of additional charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses consist of technology and facilities, sales and marketing, personnel, outsourcing and professional fees and general, administrative and other expenses. Operating expenses include $21.9 million and $14.3 million related to new products for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For Fair Value Loans, we no longer capitalize direct loan origination expenses, instead expensing them in operating expenses as incurred. For Fair Value Notes, we no longer capitalize financing expenses, instead including them within operating expenses as incurred.
Technology and facilities
Technology and facilities expenses are the largest component of our operating expenses, representing the costs required to build our omni-channel network and technology platform, and consist of three components. The first component is comprised of costs associated with our technology, engineering, information security, cybersecurity, platform development, maintenance, and end user services, including fees for software licenses, consulting, legal and other services as a result of our efforts to grow our business, as well as personnel expenses. The second includes rent for retail and corporate locations, utilities, insurance, telephony costs, property taxes, equipment rental expenses, licenses and fees and depreciation and amortization. Lastly, this category also includes all software licenses, subscriptions, and technology service costs to support our corporate operations, excluding sales and marketing.
Technology and facilities. Technology and facilities expense increased by $27.8 million, or 27.3%, from $102.0 million for 2019 to $129.8 million for 2020. The increase is primarily due to $8.1 million higher compensation expense and benefits and $2.8 million higher rent expense and higher depreciation on leasehold improvements due to the increased number of retail locations as we have continued to build our omni-channel network. Our retail locations grew from 337 at December 31, 2019 to 361 at December 31, 2020, or 7.1%. We also had a $6.4 million increase in service costs related to higher usage of software and cloud services, $5.8 million higher depreciation of additions related to internally developed software and a $1.7 million increase in professional services and other related costs to supplement staffing for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the corresponding costs for the year ended December 31, 2019. In November 2020, we decided to cease originating direct auto loans used to purchase a vehicle and recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million related to fixed assets and system development costs. We continue to invest in developing our secured personal loan product.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist of two components and represent the costs to acquire our customers. The first component is comprised of the expense to acquire a customer through various paid marketing channels including direct mail, radio, television, digital marketing and brand marketing. The second component is the costs associated with our telesales, lead generation and retail operations, including personnel expenses, but excluding costs associated with retail locations.
Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses to acquire our customers decreased by $7.8 million, or 8.0%, from $97.2 million for 2019 to $89.4 million for 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a $5.9 million decrease related to a 20% decline in direct mail volume, a decrease of $2.7 million in personnel-related costs due to the redeployment of retail employees to assist with customer service and $3.5 million in savings due to discontinued use of radio media buys in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by $3.6 million of increased marketing spend related to investment in marketing initiatives across various marketing channels, including digital advertising channels, lead aggregators, and brand marketing and an increase of $0.7 million in other personnel-related costs primarily attributable to certain COVID-19 expenses on behalf of our retail employees. CAC increased by 48.6%, from $134 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $199 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of our 38.2% decline in number of loans originated during the period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sales-related costs decreased from $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We were also able to reduce our marketing-related costs from $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Personnel
Personnel expenses represent compensation and benefits that we provide to our employees, and include salaries, wages, bonuses, commissions, related employer taxes, medical and other benefits provided and stock-based compensation expense for all of our staff with the exception of our telesales, lead generation, retail operations and technology which are included in sales and marketing expenses and technology and facilities, respectively.
Personnel. Personnel expense increased by $15.8 million, or 17.4%, from $90.6 million for 2019 to $106.4 million for 2020, primarily driven by a 14.7% increase in corporate employee headcount associated with risk management, data analytics and finance, $2.7 million increase due to redeployment of retail employees to assist with customer service attributed to COVID-19 pandemic and $0.7 million in severance pay related to the corporate reorganization of direct auto and ceasing of legal collections. These increases were partially offset by a lower stock compensation expense of $0.7 million.
Outsourcing and professional fees
Outsourcing and professional fees consist of costs for various third-party service providers and contact center operations, primarily for the sales, customer service, collections and store operation functions. Our contact centers located in Mexico and our third-party contact centers located in Colombia and Jamaica provide support for the business including application processing, verification, customer service and collections. We utilize third parties to operate the contact centers in Colombia and Jamaica and include the costs in outsourcing and other professional fees. Professional fees also include the cost of legal and audit services, credit reports, recruiting, cash transportation, collection services and fees and consultant expenses. For Fair Value Loans, direct loan origination expenses related to application processing are expensed when incurred. In addition, outsourcing and professional fees include any financing expenses, including legal and underwriting fees, related to our Fair Value Notes.
Outsourcing and professional fees. Outsourcing and professional fees decreased by $10.2 million, or 17.8%, from $57.2 million for 2019 to $47.1 million for 2020. This decrease resulted primarily from higher professional services fees of $3.9 million incurred in 2019 for public company readiness, a $3.6 million decrease related to ceasing legal collection on default loans beginning in August 2020, $2.2 million of lower legal fees, $1.9 million decrease in debt financing fees in August 2019 related to an asset-backed securitization and $1.1 million decrease in credit reporting costs due to lower application volume attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was partially offset by a $2.8 million increase due to 17.8% growth
in contact center outsourced headcount. This increase in headcount is expected to be temporary, and is the result of collections contingency staffing due to the uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact on delinquencies.
General, administrative and other
General, administrative and other expenses include non-compensation expenses for employees, who are not a part of the technology and sales and marketing organization, which include travel, lodging, meal expenses, office supplies, printing and shipping. Also included are franchise taxes, bank fees, foreign currency gains and losses, transaction gains and losses, debit card expenses and litigation reserve.
General, administrative and other. General, administrative and other expense increased by $5.1 million, or 33.0%, from $15.4 million for 2019 to $20.5 million for 2020, primarily due to an $8.8 million litigation settlement. These increases were partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease related to legal expenses in December 2019 and by decreases in travel expenses and postage/printing costs due to travel restrictions and remote working arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Income taxes
Income taxes consist of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes, if any. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we recognized tax expense (benefit) attributable to U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.
Income tax expense (benefit). Income tax expense decreased by $35.8 million or 157.0%, from an expense of $22.8 million for 2019 to a benefit of $13.0 million for 2020, primarily as a result of a pretax loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other factors contributing to the decrease in income tax expense are the impacts of certain provisions in the CARES Act, including the ability to carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods that had a higher statutory tax rate.
See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Income Taxes, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion on our income taxes.
Fair Value Estimate Methodology for Loans Receivable at Fair Value
Election of Fair Value Option
We have elected the fair value option to account for loans receivable held for investment ("Fair Value Loans"), and for all asset-backed notes issued on or after January 1, 2018 (the "Fair Value Notes"). We believe the fair value option for loans held for investment and asset-backed notes is a better fit for us given our high growth, short duration, high quality assets and funding structure. We believe the fair value option enables us to report GAAP net income that more closely approximates our net cash flow generation and provides increased transparency into our profitability and asset quality. Loans Receivable at Amortized Cost issued prior to January 1, 2018 are accounted for in our 2019 financial statements at amortized cost, net. Upon adoption of ASU 2019-05 effective January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on all remaining loans receivable previously measured at amortized cost ("Subsequent Fair Value Loans"). Upon the adoption of ASU 2019-05 effective January 1, 2020, we (i) released the remaining allowance for loan losses on Loans Receivable at Amortized Cost as of December 31, 2019; (ii) recognized the unamortized net originations fee income as of December 31, 2019; and (iii) measured the remaining loans originated prior to January 1, 2018 at fair value. Loans that we designate for sale will continue to be accounted for as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value until the loans receivable are sold. Asset-backed notes issued prior to January 1, 2018 are accounted for in our financial statements at amortized cost, net. After the redemption of our Series 2017-B asset-back notes on July 8, 2020, we no longer have any asset-backed notes at amortized cost as of December 31, 2020.
Fair Value Estimate Methodology for Loans Receivable at Fair Value
We calculate the fair value of Fair Value Loans using a model that projects and discounts expected cash flows. The fair value is a function of:
•Portfolio yield;
•Average life;
•Prepayments;
•Remaining cumulative charge-offs; and
•Discount rate.
Portfolio yield is the expected interest and fees collected from the loans as an annualized percentage of outstanding principal balance. Portfolio yield is based upon (a) the contractual interest rate, reduced by expected delinquencies and interest charge-offs and (b) late fees, net of late fee charge-offs based upon expected delinquencies. Origination fees are not included in portfolio yield since they are generally capitalized as part of the loan’s principal balance at origination.
Average life is the time-weighted average of expected principal payments divided by outstanding principal balance. The timing of principal payments is based upon the contractual amortization of loans, adjusted for the impact of prepayments, Good Customer Program refinances, and charge-offs.
Prepayments are the expected remaining cumulative principal payments that will be repaid earlier than contractually required over the life of the loan, divided by the outstanding principal balance.
Remaining cumulative charge-offs is the expected net principal charge-offs over the remaining life of the loans, divided by the outstanding principal balance.
Discount rate is the sum of the interest rate and the credit spread. The interest rate is based upon the interpolated LIBOR/swap curve rate that corresponds to the average life. The credit spread is based upon the credit spread implied by the whole loan purchase price at the time the flow sale agreement was entered into, updated for observable changes in the fixed income markets, which serve as a proxy for how a whole loan buyer would adjust their yield requirements relative to the originally agreed price.
Our internal valuation committee provides governance and oversight over the fair value pricing and related financial statement disclosures. Additionally, this committee provides a challenge of the assumptions used and outputs of the model, including the appropriateness of such measures and periodically reviews the methodology and process to determine the fair value pricing. Any significant changes to the process must be approved by the committee.
It is also possible to estimate the fair value of our loans using a simplified calculation. The table below illustrates a simplified calculation to aid investors in understanding how fair value may be estimated using the last eight quarters:
•Subtracting the servicing fee from the weighted average portfolio yield over the remaining life of the loans to calculate net portfolio yield;
•Multiplying the net portfolio yield by the weighted average life in years of the loans receivable, which is based upon the contractual amortization of the loans and expected remaining prepayments and charge-offs to calculate net cash flow;
•Subtracting the remaining cumulative charge-offs from the net portfolio yield to calculate the net cash flow;
•Subtracting the product of the discount rate and the average life from the net cash flow to calculate the gross fair value premium as a percentage of loan principal balance; and
•Subtracting the accrued interest and fees as a percentage of loan principal balance from the gross fair value premium as a percentage of loan principal balance to calculate the fair value premium as a percentage of loan principal balance.
The table below reflects the application of this methodology for the eight quarters since January 1, 2019, on loans held for investment effective as of January 1, 2018. Upon adoption of ASU 2019-05, effective January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on the Subsequent Fair Value Loans, which were previously measured at amortized cost. Accordingly, we did not have any loans receivable measured at amortized cost, and as a result, there are no Fair Value Pro Forma adjustments related to loans receivable for any period in 2020 shown below. The data in the table below represents our unsecured personal loan portfolio which is the primary driver of fair value.
The table below reflects the application of this methodology for the eight quarters since January 1, 2019 under Fair Value Pro Forma, as if we had elected the fair value option since inception. Upon adoption of ASU 2019-05, effective January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on the Subsequent Fair Value Loans, which were previously measured at amortized cost. Accordingly, we did not have any loans receivable measured at amortized cost, and as a result, there are no Fair Value Pro Forma adjustments related to loans receivable for any period in 2020 shown below. The data in the table below represents our unsecured personal loan portfolio which is the primary driver of fair value.
The illustrative tables included above are designed to assist investors in understanding the impact of our election of the fair value option. For a presentation of the actual impact of the election of the fair value option for the periods presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report, please see the next section, “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The Fair Value Pro Forma information is presented in that section because they are non-GAAP presentations, as they show the impact of Fair Value Pro Forma adjustment as if we had elected the fair value option since inception.
Sensitivity to Key Drivers
Upon adoption of ASU 2019-05, effective January 1, 2020, we elected the fair value option on the Subsequent Fair Value Loans, which were previously measured at amortized cost. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, we did not have any loans receivable measured at amortized cost and as a result there are no Fair Value Pro Forma adjustments related to loans receivable. Further, after the redemption of our Series 2017-B asset-back notes on July 8, 2020, we no longer have any asset-backed notes at amortized cost as of December 31, 2020. Therefore, the tables below present estimates at December 31, 2019 under Fair Value Pro Forma as if we had elected the fair value option since inception. Further, the data in the tables below for Fair Value Loans represents our unsecured personal loan portfolio which is the primary driver of fair value.
Credit Performance Sensitivity
Increases in expected future charge-offs will decrease expected cash flow and decrease fair value of the loans. Conversely, decreases in expected future charge-offs will increase expected cash flow and increase fair value of the loans.
The following table presents estimates at December 31, 2019 under Fair Value Pro Forma as if we had elected the fair value option since inception:
Interest Rate Sensitivity
Changes in benchmark interest rates are likely to impact the discount rate the market uses to value our loans and notes. Decreases in discount rate increase the fair value of the loans and notes and increases in the discount rate decrease the fair value of the loans and notes. Because an increase in the fair value of a liability is a net decrease in fair value, if the discount rate decreases for both the loans and notes then Net Revenue will be reduced; and if the discount rate increases for both, then Net Revenue will be increased.
The following table presents estimates at December 31, 2019 under Fair Value Pro Forma as if we had elected the fair value option since inception:
Prepayment Sensitivity
Increases in prepayments will decrease the average life and thus decrease the fair value of the loans. Conversely, decreases in prepayments will increase the average life of the loans and thus increase the fair value of the loans.
The following table presents estimates at December 31, 2019 under Fair Value Pro Forma as if we had elected the fair value option since inception:
Drivers of Fair Value for Fair Value Notes
We calculate the fair value of the Fair Value Notes using independent pricing services and broker price indications, which are based on quoted prices for identical or similar notes. Debt investors trade a bond based upon the interpolated swap curve rate that corresponds to the bond’s average life plus a credit spread (the bond yield or discount rate).
