Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties contained in this report and the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
The following section reflects management’s views on the financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus.
Overview
Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of Wyoming on April 25, 2006. We were organized to develop high strength fibers using recombinant DNA technology for commercial applications in technical textile. We use genetically engineered silkworms that produce spider silk to create our recombinant spider silk. Applications include performance apparel, workwear, filtration, luxury fashion, flexible composites, medical implants, and more. We believe that we have been a leader in the research and development of commercially scalable and cost effective spider silk for technical textile. Our primary proprietary fiber technology includes natural and engineered variants of spider silk produced in domesticated mulberry silkworms. Our business brings twenty-first century biotechnology to the historical silk industry, permitting us to introduce materials with innovative properties and claims into an established commercial ecosystem of silkworm rearing, silk spinning and weaving, and manufacture of garments and other products that can include our specialty fibers and textiles. Specialty fibers are engineered for specific uses that require exceptional strength, flexibility, heat resistance and/or chemical resistance. The specialty fiber market is exemplified by two synthetic fiber products that come from petroleum derivatives: (1) aramid fibers; and (2) ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. The technical textile industry involves products for both industrial and consumer products, such as filtration fabrics, medical textiles (e.g., sutures and artificial ligaments), safety and protective clothing and fabrics used in military and aerospace applications (e.g., high-strength composite materials).
We are using genetic engineering technologies to develop fibers with greater strength, resiliency and flexibility for use in our target markets, namely the specialty fiber and technical textile industries.
On April 16, 2020, we announced that we successfully developed a new technology platform, based on a non-CRISPR gene editing knock-in knock-out technology. CRISPR is the most recent and efficient gene editing technology2 CRISPR stands for “Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.” This is our first knock-in knock-out technology of essentially pure spider silk transgenic. This new system is built on our eco-friendly and cost-effective silkworm production system, which we believe is significantly more advanced than any competing methods. Knock-in knock-out technology allows for the targeting of specific locations and genetic traits for modification, addition, and removal. This new capability will accelerate new product developments, which should allow us to bring products to market more quickly. This capability also allows for genetic trait modifications that were previously impractical, creating opportunities for products outside of silk fibers and increased flexibility in production location. Based on our internal studies, the new technology has a purity rate that is significantly greater than Dragon Silk, a fiber that we developed with our previous tools. Samples of Dragon Silk has already demonstrated to be tougher than many fibers used in bullet proof vests and we expect that the increased spider silk purity, created using this new approach, will yield materials beyond those capabilities. This new system utilizes our eco-friendly and cost-effective silkworm production system, which we believe is significantly more advanced than any of the competing methods. We have already begun the validation process for the first of these new transgenics and anticipate that U.S. production will be possible as early as 2022 or 2023.
This does not affect our current work of overseeing our production facility to ramp up our production of Dragon SilkTM and Monster Silk®, as these fibers are designed to address their own markets.
In August 2019, we received authorization to begin rearing genetically enhanced silkworms at our production facility in Vietnam. We received our investment registration certificate for the facility in April 2018. In October 2019, we delivered the first batch of these silkworms and began operations. These silkworms will serve as the basis for the commercial expansion of our proprietary silk technology. On November 4, 2019, we reported that we had successfully completed rearing the first batch of its transgenic silkworms at the Quang Nam production factory. Seasonal challenges in late December 2019 slowed production operations and the restrictions imposed due to the global pandemic further delayed our operations in 2020 by about 4-6 months. However, we were able to resume production operations of our specialized silk in October 2020, once travel and work restrictions for COVID-19 were lifted. In January 2021 we delivered the first sample silk shipment from this factory. We believe that we will be able to target a capacity of 40 metric tons of our recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from this factory once it reaches maximum utilization. This capacity will allow us to address initial demand for our products and materials for various applications in the protective, performance, and luxury textile markets.

Plan of Operations
During the next twelve months, we expect to take the following steps in connection with the further development of our business and the implementation of our plan of operations:
● We plan to establish a apparel brand under a joint venture with Kings Group to create a line of fashion wear trade named SpydasilkTM
● We plan to continue the expansion of our production operations at our Quang Nam, Vietnam factory in accordance with our investment and enterprise registration certificates, including the planting of additional mulberry fields in collaboration with local farming cooperatives and the hiring of additional direct staff for our factory as needed.
● We plan to accelerate both our microbiology and selective breeding programs as well as provide more resources for our material testing protocols. We spent approximately $89,000 over the last 12 months on research and development of high strength polymers. In 2020, we directed our research and development efforts on growing our internal capabilities; we plan to continue to dedicate our efforts in 2021/2022 to grow our internal research and development programs.
● We will consider buying an established revenue producing company in a compatible business, in order to broaden our financial base and facilitate the commercialization of our products; as of the date hereof, we have not had any formal discussion or entered into any definitive agreements regarding any such purchase.
● We will also actively consider pursuing collaborative research opportunities with both private and university laboratories in areas of research which overlap the company’s existing research and development. One such potential area for collaborative research which the company is considering is protein expression platforms. If our financing allows, management will give strong consideration to increasing the breadth of our research to include protein expression platform technologies.
● We plan to actively pursue collaborative research and product testing opportunities with companies in the biotechnology, materials, textile and other industries.
● We plan to actively pursue additional collaborative commercialization, marketing and manufacturing opportunities with companies in the textile and material sectors for the fibers we developed and for any new polymers that we create in the remainder of 2021 and going forward.
● We plan to actively pursue the development of commercial scale production of our recombinant materials including Monster Silk® and Dragon SilkTM.
● We have initiated and plan to accelerate our efforts for large scale U.S. production. This work will include the research and production of a new transgenic tailored specifically domestic production.
Limited Operating History
We have not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our business through an increased investment in our research and development efforts. We cannot guarantee that the research and development efforts described in this filing will be successful. Our business is subject to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources, risks inherent in the research and development process and possible rejection of our products in development.
If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our research and development and other operations. Equity financing will result in dilution to existing stockholders.
Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and on March 10, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus include restrictions on travel, and quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. The coronavirus and actions taken to mitigate it have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company operates. While the closures and limitations on movement, domestically and internationally, are expected to be temporary, if the outbreak continues on its current trajectory the duration of the supply chain disruption could reduce the availability, or result in delays, of materials or supplies to and from the Company, which in turn could materially interrupt the Company’s business operations. As stated above, U.S. travel restrictions impacted our ability to ship eggs to our Vietnam facility and without such eggs, we cannot conduct operations there. In October of 2020, with restrictions lifted, we were able to deliver silkworm eggs to the Vietnam facility and production resumed. In January 2021 we delivered the first sample silk shipment from the factory. Given the speed and frequency of the continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact to its consolidated results of operations. The Company’s manufacturing facilities support business that have been deemed essential by their respective state governments and remain operational. We have taken every precaution possible to ensure the safety of our employees.
On March 19, 2020, we furloughed non-essential staff consistent with leading health official recommendations in order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. This decision was made in an abundance of caution and will primarily impact staff at our fully owned subsidiary, Prodigy Textiles, in Vietnam and will result in the temporary closing of silk rearing operations at that facility. As of the date hereof, we have resumed silk production operations at the factory in Vietnam. The temporary suspension of rearing operations resulted in a delay of 4-6 months in the Company’s production expansion schedule. The Company supported its furloughed staff and paid their salaries through June 30, 2020. During the duration of the furlough, the Company CEO did not receive or accrue any salary. On July 1, 2020, furloughed staff returned to work preparing the factory in Vietnam to receive the next shipment of silkworm eggs. On October 24, 2020, silk production operations at the factory resumed. In January 2021 we delivered the first sample silk shipment from the factory. The global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely, including its potential effect on our plans and timelines.
Additionally, it is reasonably possible that estimates made in the financial statements have been, or will be, materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, including losses on inventory; impairment losses related to goodwill and other long-lived assets and current obligations.
Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Our revenue, operating expenses, and net loss from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, were as follows - some balances on the prior period’s combined financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation:
Net Revenues: During the year ended December 31, 2020, we realized $0 of revenues from our business. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we realized $0 of revenues from our business. Accordingly, there was no change in revenues between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Research and development expenses: During year ended December 31, 2020 we incurred $88,470 research and development expenses. During year ended December 31, 2019 we incurred $223,050 of research and development expenses, a decrease of $134,580 or 60.34% compared with the same period in 2019. The research and development expenses are attributable to the research and development with the Notre Dame University; the decrease was due to the timing of research related activity and costs by insources the Company’s research operations.
Professional Fees: During year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $397,727 professional expenses, which increased by $54,882 or 16.01% from $342,845 for year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in professional fees expense was attributable to increased expenses related to investor relations services during year ended December 31, 2020.
Officers Salary: During year ended December 31, 2010, officers’ salary expenses decreased to $516,332 or 17.68% compared to $627,197 for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is due to the Company’s staff having been furloughed from March 19, 2020 - June 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the CEO also did not receive or accrue any salary.
General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses increased by $2,104,545 or 148.84% to $3,518,527 for year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,413,982 for year ended December 31, 2019. Our general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of other general and administrative expenses (which includes expenses such as Auto, Business Development, SEC Filing, Investor Relations, General Office, warrant Compensation) of $3,177,652 Travel of $29,528, office salary of $311,347 for a total of $3,518,527. Our general and administrative expenses for year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of consulting fees of $5,787 and other general and administrative expenses (which includes expenses such as Auto, Business Development, SEC Filing, Investor Relations, General Office, warrant Compensation) of $1,123,787, Travel of $40,734, office salary of $243,674 for a total of $1,413,982. The primary reason for the increase in comparing year ended December 31, 2020 to the corresponding period for 2019 was mainly due to general business expenses and warrants issuances for services.
Rent - Related Party: During the year ended December 31 2020, rent-related party expense decreased to $13,092 or 11.50% compared to $14,793 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is due to an adjustment in 2019 per ASC 843 lease valuation.
Interest Expense: Interest expense increased to $386,624, or 31.35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $294,352 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to interest on the related party loans and accounts payable and accrued expenses to the related parties.
Amortization of original issue and debt discounts: Amortization of original issue and debt discount increased to $50,505, or 100% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to amortization of original issue and debt discounts on convertible loan.
Interest Income: Interest income decreased by $6,369 to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6,369 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to interest on bank accounts.
Net Loss: Net loss increased by $2,061,427, or 70.84%, to a net loss of $4,971,277 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from a net loss of $2,909,850 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in net loss was driven primarily by increased in warrant compensation and professional fees.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Our financial statements have been presented on the basis that we have a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the financial statements, we incurred a net loss of $4,971,277 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and losses are expected to continue in the near term. The accumulated deficit is $34,769,183 at December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 2 for our discussion of stockholder deficit. We have been funding our operations through private loans and the sale of common stock in private placement transactions. Refer to Note 6 and Note 7 in the financial statements for our discussion of notes payable and shares issued, respectively. Our cash resources are insufficient to meet our planned business objectives without additional financing. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of our company to continue as a going concern.
Management anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to develop and expand our business before significant positive operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. At December 31, 2020, we had $816,907 of cash on hand. These funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need to seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.
Management has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) controlling overhead and expenses; and (c) executing material sales or research contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company can successfully accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. As of the date of this Report, we have not entered into any formal agreements regarding the above.
In the event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not considered this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence.
Cash, total current assets, total assets, total current liabilities and total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, were as follows:
At December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficit of $6,631,299, compared to a working capital deficit of $5,427,614 at December 31, 2019. Current liabilities increased to $7,450,794 at December 31, 2020 from $5,584,383 at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of primarily as a result of accounts payable and accrued compensation.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operations of $1,254,712 was the result of a net loss of $4,971,277 offset by depreciation expense of $28,074, amortization of original issue and debt discount of $50,505, options issued to related parties of $2,845,459, imputed interest on related party loans of $58,817, decrease in prepaid expenses of $29,159, a decrease in operating lease right of use of $108,217, an increase of accrued expenses and other payables-related party of $657,520, an increase in accounts payable of $39,055 and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $100,239. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operations of $1,087,881 was the result of a net loss of $2,909,850 offset by depreciation expense of $30,781, warrant cancellation of $19,915, options issued to related parties of $696,934, imputed interest on related party loans of $22,337, increase in prepaid expenses of $24,887, a decrease in operating lease right of use of $86,326, an increase of accrued expenses and other payables-related party of $795,633, an increase in accounts payable of $314,369 and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $79,609.
Net cash used in our investing activities were $0 and $100,792 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 is attributable to purchases of fixed assets.
Our financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of $1,946,595 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is represented by $1,015,000 proceeds from a shareholder note payable, proceeds from convertible note payable, net of $950,000, payment of debt offering costs of $86,000 related to convertible note payable, $40,000 loan repayment, contributed capital by related party of $17,495 and proceeds from SBA Paychex Protection Loan of $90,100. Our financing activities resulted in a cash inflow of $1,300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is represented by $1,000,000 proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $20,000 loan repayment and $320,000 proceeds from a shareholder note payable.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, and revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact its financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Changes to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of ASU’s to the FASB’s Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASU’s on our financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ deficit, cash flows, or presentation thereof.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in the ASU include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses, and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, the ASU requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. We have not early adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470- 20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. Further, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02, and ASU 2020-03 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2020. The ASUs did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2016-13 applies to all financial assets including loans, trade receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities” (SPEs).
