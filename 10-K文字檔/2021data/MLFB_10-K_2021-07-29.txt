Such statements reflect our Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance and involve risks and uncertainties.

Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
The following discussion is qualified by reference to and should be read in conjunction with our Company’s financial statements and the notes thereto.
Plan of Operation
The Company is seeking to establish, develop and operate MLFB as a professional spring/summer football league. We intend to establish franchises in cities overlooked by existing professional sports leagues and provide fans with professional football in the NFL off-seasons, which will enable us to take a totally non-adversarial approach towards the NFL. We have commenced the process of leasing playing venues and acquiring football equipment. We have obtained required workers compensation insurance for certain states where we will play games. Our spring and early summer schedule ensures no direct competition with autumn/winter football, including the 32 NFL, 9 Canadian Football League, 627 NCAA, 91 NAIA, 142 JUCO’s, 27 Canadian Universities, and thousands of high school and collegiate institution teams. While the AAF and XFL Leagues have ceased operations, they did prove the concept of fan interest for Spring football. As a result, we believe that their lack of financial success was in their financial model, expense structure, venue selection and rents. The XFL, which played five games in 2020 before filing for bankruptcy re-organization, has announced plans to restart in 2023.
MLFB will serve as a pipeline to develop players on and off the field, coaches, officials, scouts, trainers, and all other areas of the game that the NFL needs today. We will also give NFL representatives the opportunity to view our team practices, game footage, practice tapes and confer with league coaches, team officials and staff. We believe this will provide our league with recognition and demonstrate our economic model and the market’s desire for spring football.
Management, as noted in a recent Form 8-K filing, studied in depth the possibility of having a Demonstration Season in the summer of 2021 as a means of introducing MLFB as a league and overcoming some of the difficulties encountered because of Covid-19. While the pandemic has gradually eased and crowd capacities increased, this occurred late in the process to commence a Demonstration Season. In addition, our analysis of the cost for playing three games plus television, exceeded $3 million. As anxious as we, our shareholders and fans are to get started, management and our Board of Directors believe that the cost/ reward ratio and time challenges dictated that we allocate those resources to our planned 2022 football season. This would include preparation for a launch with training camp beginning in April 2022. The Demonstration Season was probably going to generate minimal revenue and we did not want to rush our product to the field. Covid-19 remediation costs were still going to be high but are trending down as new detection products come on the market. While frustrating to many constituents, our management style has been cautious, and its cornerstone has been to minimize known risks. We believe that The planned spring 2022 football season will allow us to put an economically sustainable league and product on the field and one in which our shareholders can be proud for years.
We require short-term financing as well as financing over the next 12 months and as noted in previous filings, As noted in previous filings, the Company has been pursuing short term financing of approximately $3 million followed by a tiered subsequent raise of approximately $27 million between the end of 2021 and the first calendar quarter of 2022. However, as discussed previously, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully obtain the required capital in this timeframe
The Company has engaged the services of a well-known and respected investment bank headquartered in New York to assist in that effort. In addition, our management has been engaged with several high net-worth individuals and funds who have expressed an interest in being part of our League as investors. However, the funds required by the Company at this time may be substantially less than the $27 million referred to above.
Financial Condition
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $185,381 and $1,510,156 for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, the Company had net cash used in operating activities of $213,518 and $456,382 for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At April 30, 2021, the Company has a working capital deficit of $4,319,993, an accumulated deficit of $28,992,782 and a stockholders’ deficit of $4,249,163, which could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operations.
Results of Operations
Year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the year ended April 30, 2020
For the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, we had no revenue, respectively. The Company is working through its business plan to establish, develop and operate MLFB as a professional spring football.
Total operating expenses for the year ended April 30, 2021 were $386,186 as compared to total operating expenses for the year ended April 30, 2020 of $581,023 or a decrease of $194,837. The decrease from 2020 to 2021 was primarily from a $105,949 decrease in professional fees, a $58,888 decrease in general and administrative expenses and a $30,000 decrease for a write off of a stadium lease deposit. The $105,949 decrease in professional fees was primarily from $54,131 decrease in investor relations and a $49,006 decrease in consulting. The $54,131 decrease in investor relations was primarily from a $60,000 claim made by a consultant in 2020 for services that the company disputes with no comparable amount in 2021. This was offset by $6,369 increase in public relations services. The $49,006 decrease in consulting was primarily from $36,900 of sports apparel services and $10,934 of consulting services with five consultants, both with no comparable amounts in 2021.
The $58,888 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily from a $40,179 decrease in insurance expense and a $31,120 decrease in travel expense, offset by a $17,346 increase in rent expense. The decrease in insurance expense was for workers compensation and liability insurance for previous football camps with no comparable amount in 2021. The decrease in travel expense was primarily because of the impact of Covid-19 and the restrictions on travel by the pandemic. The increase in rent expense was primarily from storage rental fees in Texas for football equipment. The $30,000 decrease in the write off of a stadium lease deposit was for a deposit that could not be transferred from 2019 to future MLFB planned football seasons in 2020 with no comparable amount in 2021.
Other income (expense) for the year ended April 30, 2021 was $200,805 of income as compared to $929,133 of expense for the year ended April 30, 2020, or an increase in income of $1,129,938. The increase in income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily from (1) a $603,950 gain from the change fair value of conversion option liability, (2) $350,072 from the initial fair value of conversion option liability in 2020 with no comparable amount in 2021 and (3) a $319,535 decrease in interest expense, offset by (4) $166,667 of settlement expense and cancellation of accounts payable income in 2020 with no comparable amount in 2021.
The decrease in interest expense is primarily (1) a $187,329 decrease for the amortization of debt discounts on convertible promissory notes, (2) $117,231 decrease in interest expense for debt and (3) a $37,052 decrease in put premium liability related to convertible promissory notes.
We had a net loss of $185,381 and $1,510,156 for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
From inception, we have relied upon the infusion of capital through equity transactions and the issuance of debt to obtain liquidity. We had $19,778 of cash at April 30, 2021 and consequently, payment of operating expenses will have to come similarly from either equity capital to be raised from investors or from borrowed funds. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising such additional equity capital or additional borrowings or if we can, that we can do so at a cost that management believes to be appropriate.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on our best knowledge of current and anticipated events, actual results could differ from the estimates.
