Business Overview
New Business Plan
On June 2, 2020, TN3, LLC, a limited liability company owned by Daniel G. Martin, purchased all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock from Tom Djokovich, our former president and chief executive officer, for $50,000. In addition, TN3 agreed to pay for certain expenses of the transaction incurred by Mr. Djokovich and the Company totaling more than $50,000. Upon acquiring the preferred shares, Mr. Martin became the sole director and chief executive officer of the Company. For more information about Mr. Martin’s acquisition of the preferred stock and his appointment to our board, please see our Schedule 14F-1/A filed with the SEC on May 13, 2020 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 8, 2020.
Following Mr. Martin’s acquisition of Mr. Djokovich’s preferred stock, the Company changed the delivery method for its solar contracting operations by outsourcing the completion of sold projects under a transition services agreement with a licensed California contractor owned by Mr. Djokovic (the “Service Provider”). The Company’s intent was to transition from providing contracting services directly to its customers to marketing solar services to potential customers and referring those customers to the Service Provider or engaging the Service Provider to provide the services to customers on behalf of the Company. The Company’s operations in future periods will be focused on generating a referral fee of 1% of any gross sales generated through these referrals. We anticipate that this change in operations, and delivery method, will have a negative impact on our gross sales and resulting revenues, if any. However, the Company began efforts to expand its operations to include the commercialization of developmental healthcare solutions in the biotechnology, medical, and health and wellness markets which efforts are ongoing. There can be no assurance that the Company’s change to its contracting operations to focus on referral fee revenues, and its efforts to expand operations into healthcare solutions in the biotechnology, medical, and health and wellness markets will be successful, or that the Company will continue to generate revenues of significance similar to prior periods.
On June 2, 2020, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Innovest Global, Inc. to acquire StemVax for 7.5 million shares of our unregistered common stock (after giving effect to the 1-for-1,000 reverse stock split described in this information statement). The acquisition was completed on September 8, 2020.
We believe that investing in the biotechnology industry will significantly increase value for our shareholders. However, we cannot guaranty that we will be successful in this endeavor or that we can locate, acquire and finance the acquisition of biotechnology companies. Currently, we continue to engage in the marketing of solar photovoltaic power generation and storage solutions.

The decrease of $564,390, during fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the Company’s change in focus from commercial solar system sales and the sale of steel canopy construction services to investing in the biotechnology industry following Company’s acquisition.

Net Loss:
For fiscal 2020, our net loss was $(6,770,215) as compared to a net income of $2,343,982 for fiscal 2019. The majority of the increase in net loss of $9,114,197 was due to an increase in other (expenses) associated with a loss recognized on conversion of preferred stock and the net change in derivative instruments estimated each period. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price, volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on managements’ estimates. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period, therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flow used in investing activities - discontinued operations was $0 in fiscal 2020, compared to cash flow used by investing activities of $2,284 for fiscal 2019. The increase of $2,284 in investing activities was primarily due to fixed assets purchased in the fiscal year 2019.
Cash flow provided by financing activities was $85,399 for fiscal 2020, as compared to cash used by financing activities of $24,300 during fiscal 2019. The increase in cash flow provided by financing activities was the result of cash advances from related parties.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
