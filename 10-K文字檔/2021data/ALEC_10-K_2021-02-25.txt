Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering immuno-neurology, a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegeneration. Immuno-neurology targets immune dysfunction as a root cause of multiple pathologies that are drivers of degenerative brain disorders. We are developing therapies designed to simultaneously counteract these pathologies by restoring healthy immune function to the brain. Supporting our scientific approach, our Discovery Platform enables us to advance a broad portfolio of product candidates, validated by human genetics, which we believe will improve the probability of technical success over shorter development timelines. As a result we have identified over 100 immune system targets, have advanced four product candidates, AL001, AL002, AL003, and AL101 into clinical development, and continue to develop our research pipeline.
Our operations have been financed primarily through the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, our collaboration with AbbVie, and issuance of common stock upon the completion of our IPO. We completed our IPO in February 2019, and received $168.2 million net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We completed a follow-on offering in January 2020 and received $224.5 million net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.
To date, we have not had any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales nor been profitable. Further, we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until such time, if ever, that we are able to successfully complete the development and obtain marketing approval for one of our product candidates. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. We have incurred net losses in each year since inception and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $190.2 million, $105.4 million, and $52.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $410.0 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•
advance product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
pursue regulatory approval of product candidates;
•
hire additional personnel;
•
continue to operate as a public company;
•
acquire, discover, validate, and develop additional product candidates;
•
require the manufacture of supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials; and
•
obtain, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future. Our revenue to date has been primarily related to the AbbVie Agreement to co-develop product candidates in two
programs in clinical development with AbbVie. We recognize revenue related to our research and development grant as the related research services are performed. We recognize revenue from the upfront payments under the AbbVie Agreement over time as the services are provided. Revenues are recognized as the program costs are incurred by measuring actual costs incurred to date compared to the overall total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation. In addition to receiving the upfront payments, we may also be entitled to development and regulatory milestone payments, opt-in payments for continued development after proof-of-concept for AL002 and AL003, and other future payments from profit sharing or royalties after commercialization of product candidates from such programs.
We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from the AbbVie Agreement. The balance of deferred revenue was $132.3 million as of December 31, 2020. The deferred revenue is expected to be recognized over the research and development period of the programs through the completion of proof-of-concept for AL002 and AL003.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We record research and development expenses as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the discovery and development of our product candidates, which include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract organizations, preclinical testing organizations, and consultants;
•
costs related to production of clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;
•
laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
costs related to the preparation of regulatory submissions;
•
third-party license fees; and
•
facilities and other expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation and amortization expense, and other supplies.
We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, collaborators, and third-party service providers. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered and as services are performed.
Specific program expenses include expenses associated with the development of our most advanced product candidates, AL001 which commenced dosing of the first patient in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, INFRONT-3, and remains in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, AL002, which commenced dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial, and AL003 and AL101, which are in Phase 1 clinical trials. We also have expenses related to the discovery and development of future product candidates and separately tracked expenses related to programs that we expect to move out of preclinical studies and into Phase 1 clinical trials. We do not track personnel or other operating expenses incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis. These expenses primarily relate to salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, facility expenses, including depreciation, and lab consumables.
At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, as our product candidates advance into later stages of development, as we begin to conduct larger clinical trials, as we seek
regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our personnel in executive, legal, finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees paid for accounting, auditing, consulting, and tax services, insurance costs, and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our programs. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of the NASDAQ Stock Market on which our securities are traded, legal, auditing, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. In connection with our arbitration proceeding against Dr. Asa Abeliovich, our former consulting co-founder, an independent arbitrator issued a confidential decision in favor of the Company and the amount of damages will be determined in a pending proceeding. We expect these arbitration related expenses to decrease.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities and foreign currency transaction gains and losses incurred during the period.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue
Collaboration revenue was $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We recognize revenue from the upfront payments under the AbbVie Agreement over time as the services are provided. Revenues are recognized as the program costs are incurred by measuring actual costs incurred to date compared to the overall total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation. Changes in estimates for revenue recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative basis. Revenue decreased by $0.1 million, reflecting the level of our estimated cumulative research activities on the AL002 and AL003 programs under the AbbVie Agreement.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $156.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $56.3 million was driven by a $23.3 million increase in AL001 related to manufacturing runs and continued progression through clinical trials. We had a $15.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount and issuance of option grants to employees. In addition, expenses increased by $9.9 million for AL044, a recent program to progress to preclinical trials, and increased by $6.6 million for other early stage programs as we continue to invest in developing our pipeline.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $24.3 million was driven by a $12.2 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount and issuance of option grants to employees. In addition, there was an $8.2 million increase in legal expense due mainly to our arbitration proceeding that we commenced in June 2019 with decision issued in November 2020. We also had a $3.4 million increase in consulting expense to support the growth of the business related to information technology, accounting, human resources, and other administrative functions.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net was $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $4.1 million was due to due lower investment yields on our marketable securities.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Revenue
Total revenue was $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recognize revenue from the upfront payments under the AbbVie Agreement over time as the services are provided. Revenues are recognized as the program costs are incurred by measuring actual costs incurred to date compared to the overall total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation. Changes in estimates for revenue recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative basis. Revenue decreased by $6.5 million, primarily due to an increase in total expected costs for the AL002 and AL003 programs through the completion of proof-of-concept.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $27.5 million was driven by an $11.8 million increase in personnel related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount and issuance of option grants to employees. There was a $6.3 million increase in facilities and other unallocated research and development related to the lease expense for the new headquarters and higher depreciation expense due to purchase of property and equipment. Expenses for AL101 increased by $5.0 million as we did not incur any expenses for AL101 until the second quarter of 2018 and this year we began clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, expenses increased by $3.7 million for other early stage programs, including AL044, as we continue to invest in developing our pipeline.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $23.2 million was primarily due to an $10.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in headcount and issuance of option grants to employees. Facilities and general overhead expenses increased by $6.6 million due to additional lease expense related to the lease for the new headquarters, impairment loss on the right-of-use asset related to the sublease, higher depreciation expense due to purchase of property and equipment, directors and officers insurance necessary to operate a public company, and other allocated costs from the increased headcount. The increase is also due to a $4.5 million increase in legal expense due to increased costs of operating as a public company, increased patent costs, and our arbitration proceeding that we commenced in June 2019.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net was $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $4.0 million was due to interest income earned after we invested the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon completion of the IPO into marketable securities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception through December 31, 2020, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds of $210.5 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock and through the $205.0 million in upfront payments from the AbbVie Agreement. In addition, on February 7, 2019, we completed our IPO through issuing and selling 9,739,541 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share, including 489,541 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds from the offering of $168.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs. On January 30, 2020, we completed a follow-on offering through issuing and selling 9,602,500 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share, including 1,252,500 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $224.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs. As of December 31, 2020, we had $413.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $410.0 million.
Future Funding Requirements
Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures related to our programs, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We expect our expenses to continue to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, in particular as we continue to advance our product candidates and our discovery programs. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least mid-2022. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may also choose to seek additional financing opportunistically. We expect to need to obtain substantial additional funding in the future for our research and development activities and continuing operations. If we were unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
•
our ability to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, commercial manufacturing;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and establish new research and development programs;
•
addition and retention of key research and development personnel;
•
our efforts to enhance operational, financial, and information management systems, and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates;
•
negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter and performing our obligations in such collaborations;
•
the timing and amount of milestone and other payments we may receive under our collaboration arrangements;
•
our eventual commercialization plans for our product candidates;
•
the costs involved in prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims, including related to the ongoing arbitration proceeding that we commenced in June 2019; and
•
the costs and timing of regulatory approvals.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $166.7 million. This was mainly due to the net loss of $190.2 million and the decrease in deferred revenue of $21.1 million as revenue was recognized related to the AbbVie Agreement. This was partially offset by a non-cash charges of $30.5 million for stock-based compensation and $5.9 million for depreciation and amortization expense. We also had an increase of $12.2 million in accrued liabilities and accrued clinical supply costs, which offset the cash used in operating activities.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $99.3 million. This was mainly due to the net loss of $105.4 million and the decrease in deferred revenue of $21.2 million as revenue was recognized related to the AbbVie Agreement. This was offset by a non-cash charges of $16.3 million for stock-based compensation and $3.8 million for depreciation and amortization expense. We also had an increase of $9.2 million in accrued liabilities and accrued clinical supply costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $127.5 million. The net cash inflow from operations primarily resulted from the receipt of $200.0 million upfront payment from AbbVie in January 2018, that was reflected as a net increase in deferred revenue of $172.5 million during the period. This was mainly offset by net loss of $52.2 million. In addition, the company had a non-cash charge of $6.9 million for stock-based compensation.
Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities of $105.1 million was primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities of $506.8 million offset by the proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $406.8 million. In addition, we used cash for the purchase of $5.0 million of property and equipment.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities of $48.9 million was primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities of $529.6 million offset by the proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $496.0 million. In addition, we used cash for the purchase of $15.3 million of property and equipment.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities of $224.1 million was primarily related to the purchase of short-term marketable securities of $472.2 million offset by the proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $250.0 million. In addition, we used cash for the purchase of $1.9 million of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities of $232.1 million was primarily from net proceeds of the issuance of 9,602,500 shares of our common stock upon the completion of a follow-on public offering. In addition, we received $6.3 million cash from the exercise of options to purchase common stock.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities of $172.4 million was primarily from net proceeds of the issuance of 9,739,541 shares of our common stock upon the completion of our IPO.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities of $131.1 million was from net proceeds of the issuance of 9,373,633 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock in April 2018, July, and October 2018, offset by payment of $1.9 million of deferred offering costs for our IPO.
Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue from the upfront payments under the AbbVie Agreement over time as the services are provided. We recognize collaboration revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation using an input measure. In order to recognize revenue over the research and development period, the Company measures actual costs incurred to date compared to the overall total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation. Revenues are recognized as the program costs are incurred. We re-evaluate the estimate of expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation each reporting period and make adjustments for any significant changes. Clinical trials are expensive and can take many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Changes in our forecasted costs are likely to occur over time based upon changes in clinical trial procedures set forth in protocols, changes in estimates of manufacturing costs, or feedback from regulators on the design or operation of our clinical trials. We have had changes to the overall expected costs to satisfy the performance obligations from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a 7% increase in the forecast of the total expected costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the overall expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation resulted in an approximately $6.7 million reduction in revenue compared to if the expected costs had remained the same, as a result of the cumulative catch up for the change in estimate. The balance of deferred revenue was $132.3 million as of December 31, 2020. The deferred revenue is expected to be recognized over the research and development period of the programs through the completion of Phase 2 clinical trials.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
We record accrued expenses for estimated preclinical study and clinical trial expenses. Estimates are based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions, contract research organizations in connection with clinical studies, investigative sites in connection with clinical studies, vendors in connection with preclinical development activities, and contract manufacturing organizations in connection with the production of materials for clinical trials. Further, we accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the related agreement. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and make judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. If we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical studies and clinical trial accruals.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is measured at the date of grant, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line
basis. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:
Expected Term-The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term was derived by using the simplified method which uses the midpoint between the average vesting term and the contractual expiration period of the stock-based award.
Expected Volatility-We have limited information on the volatility of our stock as shares of our common stock were not actively traded on any public markets prior to February 7, 2019. The expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of comparable peer public companies within our industry. These companies are considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards. In 2020, we began giving weight to our own historical volatility in the determination of expected volatility.
Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the measurement date with maturities approximately equal to the expected term.
Expected Dividend-The expected dividend rate is zero because we have not historically paid and do not expect for the foreseeable future to pay a dividend on our common stock.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326). This ASU implements an impairment model, known as the current expected credit loss model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. For available-for-sale debt securities, entities are required to recognize an allowance for credit losses rather than an other-than-temporary impairment that reduces the cost basis of the investment. Further, an entity will recognize any changes in estimated credit losses immediately in earnings. There was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU modifies ASC 740 to simplify several aspects of accounting for income taxes, including eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in ASC 740 related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period. We early adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2020. There was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of ASU No. 2019-12.
