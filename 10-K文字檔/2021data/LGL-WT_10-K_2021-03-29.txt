Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, particularly under the headings "Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors."
Results of Operations
Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations
We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting our industry generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on our revenues or income other than those listed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and globally, our business and operations have been impacted and may be further impacted, as further discussed below.
COVID-19
The global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government in March 2020 and has negatively impacted the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to “shelter-in-place,” and created significant disruption of the financial markets.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s operations in India were closed on March 23, 2020 and resumed limited operations on May 7, 2020 with a reduced level of staffing. By the end of June 2020, the Company’s India facilities were fully staffed and operating at normal capacity. Despite the revenue decrease associated with the foregoing suspension of operations in India and other 2020 COVID-19 impacts on our business, the Company does not anticipate COVID-19 having a significant impact on the Company’s future results. However, the ultimate effect on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19 including the widespread availability and use of effective vaccines, and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.
In accordance with the Department of Defense (“DoD”) guidance issued in March 2020 designating the Defense Industrial Base as a critical infrastructure workforce, our U.S. production facilities have continued to operate in support of essential products and services required to meet national security commitments to the U.S. Government and the U.S. military; however, facility closures or work slowdowns or temporary stoppages have occurred and could occur in the future. In addition, other countries have different practices and policies that can affect our international operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. In some cases, our facilities are not operating under full staffing as a result of COVID-19. Customer visits and representative training are being impacted by travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, which could delay new design wins and future business with our customers.
The Company has taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers to minimize potential disruptions and support our community in addressing the challenges posed by this global pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our contracts in the expected timeframe, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. Government, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.
An extended period of global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 could impact our ability to perform on our contracts. To date, we have identified a number of suppliers that have potential delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and, if we are not able to continue to implement alternatives or other mitigations, contract deliveries could be adversely impacted.
Delays in inspection, acceptance and payment by our customers, many of whom are teleworking, could also affect our sales and cash flows. This is particularly an issue with respect to classified work that is unable to be done remotely. Limitations on government operations can also impact regulatory approvals such as export licenses that are needed for international sales and deliveries. In addition, we could experience delays in new contract starts or awards of future work as well as the uncertain impact of contract modifications to respond to the national emergency. Government funding priorities may change as a result of the costs of COVID-19. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, absenteeism, government actions, facility closures, travel restrictions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will be impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases, including costs for employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely, may not be fully recoverable under our contracts, or adequately covered by insurance. The impact of COVID-19 could worsen if there is an extended duration of any COVID-19 outbreak or a resurgence of COVID-19 infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience improvement.
COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which depending on future developments could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future. COVID-19 has also caused volatility in the equity capital markets. We are monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on the fair value of our assets. While we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19, future changes in expectations for sales, earnings and cash flows related to intangible assets and goodwill below our current projections could cause these assets to be impaired. While these are our current assumptions, this is an emerging situation and these could change, which could affect our outlook.
Equity Investment in Unconsolidated Subsidiary
On November 6, 2019, the Company invested $3.35 million in the Sponsor of the SPAC. The SPAC is a publicly- traded company on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “DFNS” which was formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination in the aerospace, defense and communications industries. The Sponsor holds 100% of the SPAC’s Class B common shares, which are restricted and non-tradable, and 5,200,000 private warrants. The Sponsor purchased the private warrants in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the consummation of the SPAC’s IPO. Each private warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of common stock of the SPAC at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Company’s investment in the Sponsor represents 62.2% of the Sponsor’s initial risk capital and a 43.57% interest in the Sponsor’s capital account after the SPAC IPO.
The SPAC IPO closed on November 12, 2019; proceeds from the SPAC IPO totaled $172.5 million. If the SPAC does not complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of the SPAC IPO, the proceeds from the sale of the private warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the shares sold in the SPAC IPO (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the private warrants will expire worthless. The Sponsor holds 20% of the total common shares (Class A and Class B) in the SPAC along with the 5,200,000 private warrants.
The Sponsor is managed by LGL Systems Nevada Management Partners LLC (“Nevada GP”), an affiliated entity deemed to be under the significant influence of Marc Gabelli, the Company’s Chairman of the Board. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Sponsor, as Nevada GP has the power to direct the activities of the Sponsor that most significantly impact the Sponsor’s economic performance through an operating agreement. The Company, therefore, accounts for the Sponsor under the equity method of accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized a loss on equity investment in unconsolidated subsidiary of $262,000 and $16,000, respectively.
See Note Q - Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
2020 Compared to 2019
Consolidated Revenues, Gross Margin and Backlog
Revenue was impacted by a decline in the avionics market related to reduced demand associated with the COVID pandemic. The decline was largely offset by increased sales in our defense/military and aerospace markets. Margins declined due to a period shutdown in the Company’s India operations and our requirement to maintain redundant production capability. Reduced backlog reflects lower bookings in 2020 largely from the avionics market rapid decline and other related COVID pandemic issues.
Total revenues were $31,162,000, a decrease of $735,000, or 2.3%, from $31,897,000 in 2019. The lower revenue reflects the decline in the avionics market and other related COVID pandemic issues. Sales growth was slowed by a period shutdown of production in our India facilities, which is part of our supply chain, and its subsequent phased reopening. Our facilities in India remain subject to closures based on local market regulations due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, though we continue to operate these facilities to ensure customer deliveries. Total revenue benefited from improvements in sales within our defense/military and aerospace markets.
Consolidated gross margin, which is consolidated revenues less manufacturing cost of sales as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 35.1% compared to 39.2% for the prior year. Gross margins were impacted by the product mix shift away from avionics, and from the COVID shutdown of India requiring onshoring of production to U.S. factories, resulting in increased production costs. As LGL is an essential business, we maintained our production and operations, to support our customer requirements, incurring additional costs to preserve manufacturing capabilities.
As of December 31, 2020, our order backlog was $19,801,000, a decrease of 9.4% compared to $21,857,000 as of December 31, 2019. The reduced backlog reflects lower bookings in 2020 largely from the avionics market decline related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The backlog of unfilled orders includes amounts based on signed contracts as well as agreed letters of intent, which we have determined are firm orders likely to be fulfilled primarily in the next 12 months.
Order backlog is adjusted quarterly to reflect project cancellations, deferrals, revised project scope and cost, and sales of subsidiaries, if any. We expect to fill substantially all of our order backlog as of December 31, 2020 in 2021, but cannot provide assurances as to what portion of the order backlog will be fulfilled in a given year.
Operating Income
Operating income of $1,415,000 declined by $2,024,000 from the year ended December 31, 2019 operating income of $3,439,000. The decline was due to the reduction in revenue and gross margin noted above as well a $678,000 increase in non-cash stock-based compensation costs, partly offset by a reduction in administrative costs. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses were 30.5% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 28.4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest (Expense) Income, Net
Interest (expense) income, net, showed expense of $11,000 compared to income of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Income, Net
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other income, net was $162,000 and $484,000, respectively, a decrease of $322,000 in the current year. This decline resulted principally from the income on our investment portfolio.
Income Tax Provision
We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable. Based upon the weighting of positive and negative evidence, the Company has determined the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets of $3,052,000 at December 31, 2020 will be utilized in the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s remaining valuation allowance was $379,000, consisting primarily of tax credits expiring between 2021 and 2025. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, the Company will adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.
We recorded an income tax (benefit) provision for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $336,000 and $(3,107,000), respectively. The change in our income tax (benefit) provision from the prior year was primarily due to the $3,344,000 reversal of the valuation allowance in 2019, offset by the impact of income taxes on our income.
Net Income
Net income was $968,000 compared to $7,016,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was largely due to the tax benefit from the valuation allowance reversal in 2019 ($3.3 million). The remaining decline of $2.7 million reflected the lower revenue and margins and higher costs discussed above. Basic net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.19 and $1.44, respectively. Diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.19 and $1.41, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents were $18,331,000 and $12,453,000, respectively. The $3,192,000 of cash provided from operating activities together with the $3,254,000 from sales of securities under our ATM Offering largely contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash provided by operating activities was $3,192,000 and $2,666,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $526,000 increase was primarily due to favorable changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels of $3,660,000 (including the discontinuance of certain consignment inventory offerings to our customers) and deferred taxes of $3,435,000, partly offset by the Company’s year over year decrease in net income of $6,048,000.
Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $428,000 and $6,163,000, respectively. In 2020, we made capital expenditures of $407,000 and purchased marketable securities of $21,000. In 2019, we invested $3,350,000 in an unconsolidated subsidiary, made net marketable security purchases of $1,650,000 and spend $1,163,000 on capital improvements. Capital expenditures in 2020 and 2019 were primarily for the purchase of production equipment and facility improvements.
Cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3,114,000 and $442,000, respectively. In 2020, this reflects the Company’s first quarter sale of securities under its ATM Offering of $3,254,000, costs related to the issuance of common stock warrants of $202,000 and proceeds from stock options exercised of $62,000. In 2019, the Company received $442,000 from proceeds of stock options exercised.
As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated working capital was $30,384,000, compared to $24,826,000 as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had current assets of $33,781,000, current liabilities of $3,397,000 and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 9.94 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2019, we had current assets of $28,910,000, current liabilities of $4,084,000 and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 7.08 to 1.00. Management continues to focus on efficiently managing working capital requirements to match operating activity levels and will seek to deploy the Company’s working capital where it will generate the greatest returns.
We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. However, we are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 impacts on our customers and suppliers, as well as our industry as a whole.
See Note H - Revolving Credit Agreement and Note J - Stockholders’ Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the Revolving Credit Agreement and the ATM Offering.
Our Board has adhered to a practice of not paying cash dividends. This policy takes into account our long-term growth objectives, including our anticipated investments for organic growth, potential acquisitions or other strategic ventures and stockholders' desire for capital appreciation of their holdings. No cash dividends have been paid to the Company's stockholders since January 30, 1989, and none are expected to be paid for the foreseeable future.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the carrying value of inventories, the likelihood of collecting outstanding accounts receivable, value of stock-based compensation, and the provision for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In the past, actual results have not been materially different from our estimates. However, results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
