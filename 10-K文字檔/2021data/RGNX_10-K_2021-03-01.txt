Overview
We are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. Our gene therapy product candidates are designed to deliver genes to cells to address genetic defects or to enable cells in the body to produce therapeutic proteins that are intended to impact disease. Through a single administration, our gene therapy product candidates are designed to provide long-lasting effects, potentially significantly altering the course of disease and delivering improved patient outcomes.
Overview of Product Candidates
We have developed a broad pipeline of gene therapy programs using our proprietary adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy delivery platform (NAV Technology Platform) to address genetic diseases through two modalities: AAV-mediated antibody delivery and monogenic gene replacement. The AAV-mediated antibody delivery modality is designed to treat serious and chronic diseases by delivering the genes necessary for the sustained production of therapeutic antibodies in vivo. Our monogenic gene replacement approach builds upon the well-understood mechanism of replacing a dysfunctional or missing gene with a functional copy of the gene in order to enable sustained production of necessary proteins.
Gene therapy using NAV Vectors for AAV-mediated antibody delivery

RGX-314: We are developing RGX-314 as a novel, single-administration gene therapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and other additional chronic retinal conditions which cause total or partial vision loss. We are advancing two separate routes of administration of RGX-314 to the eye, through a standardized subretinal delivery procedure as well as by delivery to the suprachoroidal space using the SCS Microinjector™ licensed from Clearside Biomedical, Inc.
In January 2021, we announced that we completed an End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the details of a pivotal program to support a Biologics License Application (BLA). The pivotal program is expected to support a Biologics License Application (BLA) filing in 2024. We plan to conduct two randomized, well-controlled clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RGX-314 in patients with wet AMD, enrolling approximately 700 patients total. The first pivotal trial (ATMOSPHERETM) is active and enrolling patients. We plan to initiate the second pivotal trial in the second half of 2021.
In February 2021, we announced additional positive data from the patients enrolled in the ongoing Phase I/II trial of RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD and its Long-Term Follow-Up study. As of January 22, 2021, RGX-314 continued to be generally well-tolerated across all dose cohorts. Durable treatment effect was observed in patients in Cohorts 4 and 5 at 1.5 years after administration of RGX-314, including stable visual acuity, decreased retinal thickness, and reductions in anti-VEGF injection burden. Long-term, durable treatment effect was demonstrated in Cohort 3 over three years, including mean improvement in vision and stable retinal thickness, and reductions in anti-VEGF treatment burden.
In September 2020, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in AAVIATETM, a Phase II trial of the suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 using the SCS Microinjector for the treatment of wet AMD. In January 2021, we announced completion of enrollment in Cohort 1 of this trial, and we expect to report interim data from Cohort 1 in the third quarter of 2021. Enrollment of patients in Cohort 2 has begun and is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2021.
In addition, we announced in December 2020 that the first patient had been dosed in ALTITUDETM, a Phase II trial of the suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 for the treatment of DR. Patient enrollment continues and we expect to complete enrollment of patients in Cohort 1 in mid-2021. We plan to report initial data from this trial in 2021.
•
AAV-Mediated Antibody Expression for the Treatment of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE): We are developing a novel, one-time treatment utilizing a NAV Vector to deliver a gene encoding for a therapeutic antibody that targets and binds to plasma kallikrein, a key protein left unregulated in patients with HAE. HAE is a chronic and severe disease characterized by recurring severe swelling (angioedema), most commonly in the face, airway, intestines and limbs. We expect to provide a program update in 2021.
•
AAV-Mediated Antibody Expression for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: We have established a research program in partnership with Neurimmune AG (Neurimmune) to jointly develop and commercialize novel gene therapies using NAV Vectors to deliver human antibodies for chronic neurodegenerative diseases, with an initial focus on diseases associated with the accumulation and deposition of the microtubule-associated protein tau (tauopathies) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-synucleinopathies). We expect to provide a program update in 2021.
Gene therapy programs for the potential treatment of rare monogenic diseases
•
RGX-202: We are developing RGX-202 for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe, progressive, degenerative muscle disease caused by mutations in the gene which encodes dystrophin, a protein involved in muscle cell structure and function. Without functional dystrophin protein, muscles throughout the body degenerate and become weak. We expect to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for this program in mid-2021.
•
RGX-121: We are developing RGX-121 for the treatment of the neurological symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), a severe genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S), an enzyme that is responsible for breakdown of cellular waste products. We are conducting a Phase I/II trial of RGX-121 in patients with MPS II under the age of 5 years old. As reported in February 2021, RGX-121 was well-tolerated in Cohorts 1 and 2 of the Phase I/II trial, and no drug-related SAEs were reported. Biomarker data from patients in both cohorts indicated encouraging signals of I2S enzyme activity in the CNS following one-time administration of RGX-121, with consistent reductions of HS and D2S6, a component of HS. Patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 also demonstrated continued neurocognitive development and evidence of I2S enzyme activity in plasma and urine following administration of RGX-121. We expect to begin dosing patients in the third dose cohort in the first quarter of 2021.
In addition, we plan to initiate a second Phase I/II trial of RGX-121 for the treatment of pediatric patients with MPS II ages 5-18 years old. We expect to begin dosing patients in this trial in the first half of 2021.
•
RGX-111: We are developing RGX-111 for the treatment of the neurological symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), a severe genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of α-l-iduronidase (IDUA), an enzyme required for breakdown of cellular waste products. We have initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-111.
•
RGX-181: We are developing RGX-181 for the treatment of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, one of the most common forms of Batten disease, caused by mutations in the tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) gene. We expect to submit an IND for the CNS delivery of RGX-181 in the first quarter of 2021, and plan to initiate enrollment in a Phase I/II trial in the first half of 2021.
•
RGX-381: We are developing RGX-381 for the treatment of ocular manifestations of CLN2 disease. We plan to submit an IND, or foreign equivalent, for the subretinal delivery of RGX-381 in the first half of 2021.
In addition to our lead product candidates described above, we have also funded, and plan to continue to fund, preclinical research on potential product candidate programs that may become part of our internal product development pipeline. We have partnered with a number of leading academic institutions and will continue to seek partnerships with innovative institutions to develop novel NAV gene therapy product candidates.
Overview of Our NAV Technology Platform
In addition to our internal product development efforts, we also selectively license the NAV Technology Platform to other leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which we refer to as NAV Technology Licensees. As of December 31, 2020, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in one FDA approved product (Zolgensma®), and the preclinical and clinical development of more than 20 partnered programs in total. Licensing the NAV Technology Platform allows us to maintain our internal product development focus on our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV gene therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue.
Impact of COVID-19
We are actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our offices, laboratories, clinical trial sites, prospective clinical trial sites, contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and other collaborators and partners are located in jurisdictions where quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders, guidelines, and other similar orders and restrictions intended to control the spread of the disease have been put in place by governmental authorities. We have implemented a work-from-home policy for all employees who are not essential to be onsite, and we may take further actions that alter our operations, as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or which we determine are in the best interests of our employees.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays to our clinical trials and may further delay or prevent us from proceeding with our clinical trials. Our other business initiatives, such as preclinical development and manufacturing operations, may also be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the construction of our new headquarters, including our current good manufacturing practice production facility, has been delayed from our original estimates, and may be delayed further, due to various government orders and restrictions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if the business and operations of our licensees are adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues could in turn be adversely affected. We are proactively taking measures to mitigate or reduce any adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progress of our clinical trials and other business initiatives.
Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments that are highly unpredictable. Please refer to the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks we face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial Overview
Revenues
Our revenues to date primarily consist of license and royalty revenue resulting from the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform. We have not generated any revenues from commercial sales of our own products. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval and adequate labeling, our ability to generate future revenues will be materially compromised.
We license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration from licensees under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products.
Royalty revenue to date consists primarily of royalties on net sales of Zolgensma, which is marketed by Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. (formerly AveXis, Inc.) (Novartis Gene Therapies), a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis AG (Novartis), for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Zolgensma is a licensed product under our license agreement with Novartis Gene Therapies for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA.
Future license and royalty revenues are dependent on the successful development and commercialization of licensed products by our licensees, which is uncertain, and revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Additionally, we may never receive consideration in our license agreements that is contemplated on option fees, development and sales-based milestone payments, royalties on sales of licensed products or sublicense fees, given the contingent nature of these payments. Our revenues are concentrated among a low number of licensees and licenses are terminable at the option of the licensee. The termination of our licenses by licensees may materially impact the amount of revenue we recognize in future periods. Please refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of segment and geographical information regarding our revenues.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist primarily of cost of revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We allocate indirect expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs, depreciation and other overhead costs between research and development and general and administrative categories based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee.
Cost of Revenues
Our cost of revenues consists primarily of upstream fees due to our licensors as a result of revenue generated from the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform, including sublicense fees, milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Sublicense fees are based on a percentage of license fees received by us from NAV Technology Licensees and are recognized in the period that the underlying license revenue is recognized. Milestone payments are payable to licensors upon the achievement of specified milestones by NAV Technology Licensees and are recognized in the period the milestone is achieved or deemed probable of achievement. Royalties are based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products by NAV Technology Licensees and are recognized in the period that the underlying sales occur. Future costs of revenues are uncertain due to the nature of our license agreements and significant fluctuations in cost of revenues may occur from period to period.
Research and Development Expense
Our research and development expense primarily consists of:
•
salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, stock-based compensation and travel, for our scientific personnel performing research and development activities;
•
costs related to executing preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
fees paid to consultants and other third-parties who support our product candidate development;
•
other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates; and
•
allocated facility-related costs, depreciation expense and other overhead.
Up-front fees incurred in obtaining technology licenses for research and development activities, as well as associated milestone payments, are expensed as incurred if the technology licensed has no alternative future use.
We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue development of our product candidates. Our current and planned research and development activities include the following:
•
a Phase I/II clinical trial and associated long-term follow-up study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the subretinal delivery of RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD;
•
pivotal trials (ATMOSPHERE and one additional pivotal trial) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the subretinal delivery of RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD;
•
Phase II clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 using the SCS Microinjector for the treatment of wet AMD (AAVIATE) and DR (ALTITUDE);
•
preclinical research and development and a planned clinical trial for RGX-202 for the treatment of DMD;
•
Phase I/II clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RGX-121 for the treatment of MPS II;
•
a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RGX-111 for the treatment of MPS I;
•
preclinical research and development and a planned Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-181 for the treatment of CLN2 disease;
•
preclinical research and development and a planned clinical trial for RGX-381 for the treatment of ocular manifestations of CLN2 disease;
•
preclinical research and development for potential product candidates to treat HAE;
•
preclinical research and development for potential product candidates to treat neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies and alpha-synucleinopathies, under our collaboration with Neurimmune;
•
completion of a long-term follow-up study for patients dosed in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501, which has been discontinued, for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH);
•
preclinical research and development for potential product candidates addressing other diseases across a range of therapeutics areas;
•
continued investment in advanced manufacturing analytics and process development activities; and
•
continued acquisition and manufacture of clinical trial materials in support of our anticipated clinical trials.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
Direct expenses related to RGX-202 and RGX-381 are included in platform and new technologies for all periods through December 31, 2019. Direct expenses related to RGX-181 are included in platform and new technologies for all periods through June 30, 2018. Direct expenses related to RGX-501 are included in other product candidates for all periods presented. We have discontinued internal clinical development of RGX-501. Planned future costs related to RGX-501 primarily relate to the completion of a long-term follow-up study for patients dosed to date.
Platform and new technologies include direct costs not identifiable with a specific lead product candidate, including costs associated with our research and development platform, process development, manufacturing analytics and early research and development for prospective product candidates and new technologies. We typically utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We do not allocate personnel and other internal costs, such as facilities and other overhead costs, to specific product candidates or development programs.
General and Administrative Expense
Our general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee travel, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes certain personnel in executive, commercial, corporate development, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related and overhead costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for accounting, legal and advisory services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, insurance costs, costs of our information systems and other commercial and general corporate activities. We expect that our general and administrative expense will continue to increase as we continue to develop, and potentially commercialize, our product candidates.
Other Income
Interest Income from Licensing
In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, interest income from licensing consists of imputed interest recognized from significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees as well as interest income accrued on unpaid balances due from licensees.
Investment Income
Investment income consists of interest income earned and gains and losses realized from our cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as unrealized gains and losses on marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of non-cash interest imputed on the liability related to the sale of future Zolgensma royalties to entities managed by Healthcare Royalty Management, LLC (collectively, HCR). Non-cash interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method, based on our estimate of total royalty payments expected to be received by HCR under the royalty purchase agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and other reported amounts, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are performed to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligations.
We apply the five-step model to contracts that are within the scope of Topic 606 only when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, for contracts within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to respective performance obligations when (or as) the respective performance obligations are satisfied.
We evaluate our contracts with customers for the presence of significant financing components. If a significant financing component is identified in a contract and provides a financing benefit to the customer, the transaction price for the contract is adjusted to account for the financing portion of the arrangement, which is recognized as interest income over the financing term using the effective interest method. In determining the appropriate interest rates for significant financing components, we evaluate the credit profile of the customer and prevailing market interest rates and select an interest rate in which we believe would be charged to the customer in a separate financing arrangement over a similar financing term.
License and royalty revenue
We license our NAV Technology Platform to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using our NAV Technology Platform. License agreements
generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration payable to us under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) option fees to acquire additional licenses, (iii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones by licensees, (iv) sublicense fees and (v) royalties on sales of licensed products.
Our license agreements are accounted for as contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606. At the inception of each license agreement, we determine the contract term for purposes of applying the requirements of Topic 606. Licenses are generally terminable at the option of the licensee with advance notice to us. For each license granted, including licenses granted upon the exercise of license options, we evaluate these termination rights to determine whether a substantive termination penalty would be incurred by the licensee upon termination. If the licensee incurs a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes is generally equal to the stated term of the license, which is the life of the underlying licensed patents. Alternatively, if the licensee does not incur a substantive termination penalty upon termination, the contract term for revenue recognition purposes may be shorter than the stated term of the license, in which case the termination rights may be accounted for as contract renewal options. The determination of whether a substantive termination penalty is associated with the termination rights requires significant judgment. In making this determination, we consider, among other things, the nature of the intellectual property rights that would be returned to us upon termination, including the exclusivity of the licensed rights and the stage of development of the licensed products, the payment terms, including the amount and timing of non-refundable or guaranteed payments, and the business purpose of the termination rights granted to the licensee. Generally, the most significant judgment in determining whether a substantive termination penalty exists relates to the amount of any up-front or guaranteed non-refundable payments relative to the amount of annual payments that may be avoided by the licensee upon termination of the license. We consider all of the facts and circumstances relevant to each license when making this determination.
Performance obligations under our license agreements may include (i) the delivery of intellectual property licenses, (ii) options granted to licensees to acquire additional licenses, to the extent the options represent material rights to the licensee, and (iii) research and development services to be performed by us related to licensed products. At the inception of each license agreement which contains options for the licensee to acquire additional licenses, or contract renewal options, we evaluate the options to determine whether they provide material rights to the licensee. In making this determination, we consider whether the options are priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying licenses. If an option is priced at a discount to the standalone selling price for the underlying license, the option is considered to be a material right to the licensee and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation under the current license agreement. At the inception of each license agreement which contains performance obligations for research and development services, we evaluate whether the license is distinct from the research and development services, which requires judgment. In making this determination, we consider, among other things, the stage of development of the licensed products and whether the research and development services will significantly impact further development of the licensed products. If it is determined that the license if not distinct from the research and development services, the license is combined with the research and development services into a single performance obligation.
We evaluate the transaction price of our license agreements at the inception of each agreement and at each reporting date. The transaction price includes the fixed consideration payable to us during the contract term, as well as any variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in the future. Fixed consideration under the license agreements includes up-front and annual fees payable during the contract term. Variable consideration under the license agreements includes development and sales-based milestone payments, sublicense fees and royalties on sales of licensed products. Consideration contingent upon the exercise of options by a licensee is excluded from the transaction price and not accounted for as part of the license agreement until the option is exercised.
The transaction price for each license agreement is allocated to the underlying performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices and recognized as revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for the delivery of an intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for license options is recognized as revenue in full upon the earlier of the option exercise or expiration. The exercise of a license option by a licensee is accounted for as a new license for revenue recognition purposes. Consideration allocated to performance obligations for research and development services is recognized as revenue as the services are performed by us.
Up-front and annual licenses fees payable to us over the contract term of each license are included in the transaction price, and the portion of this consideration that is allocated to the performance obligation for the delivery of the intellectual property license is recognized as revenue in full upon the delivery of the license to the licensee. If annual license fees are payable to us in periods beyond 12 months from the delivery of the license, a significant financing component is deemed to exist which provides a financing benefit to the licensee. If a significant financing component is identified, we adjust the transaction price for the license to include only the
present value of the annual license fees payable to us over the contract term. The discounted portion of the license fees is recognized as interest income from licensing over the financing period of the license.
Development milestone payments are payable to us upon the achievement of specified development milestones by licensees. At the inception of each license agreement that contains development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of achievement and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future, milestone payments are included in the transaction price and recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license. Milestone payments contingent on the achievement of development milestones that are not within our control or the control of the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved and are excluded from the transaction price until the milestone is achieved. At each reporting date, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of each outstanding development milestone and, if necessary, adjust the transaction price for any milestones for which the probability of achievement has changed due to current facts and circumstances. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis and recognized as revenue in the period of the adjustment.
Royalties on sales of licensed products, sales-based milestone payments and sublicense fees based on the receipt of certain fees by licensees from any sublicensees are excluded from the transaction price of each license and recognized as revenue in the period that the related sales or sublicenses occur, provided that the associated license has been delivered to the licensee.
Royalty revenue to date consists primarily of royalties on net sales of Zolgensma, which is a licensed product under our license agreement with Novartis Gene Therapies for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA. We recognize royalty revenue from net sales of Zolgensma in the period in which the underlying products are sold by Novartis Gene Therapies, which in certain cases may require us to estimate royalty revenue for periods of net sales which have not yet been reported to us. Sales-based milestone payments related to net sales of Zolgensma are recognized as royalty revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved.
We receive payments from licensees based on the billing schedules established in each license agreement. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees, including unbilled royalties, are recorded as accounts receivable when our rights to the consideration are conditional solely upon the passage of time. Amounts recognized as revenue which have not yet been received from licensees are recorded as contract assets when our rights to the consideration are not unconditional. Contract assets are recorded as other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. If a licensee elects to terminate a license prior to the end of the license term, the licensed intellectual property is returned to us and any consideration recorded as accounts receivable or contract assets which is not contractually payable by the licensee is charged off as a reduction of license revenue in the period of the termination. Amounts received by us prior to the delivery of underlying performance obligations are deferred and recognized as revenue upon the satisfaction of the performance obligations. Deferred revenue which is not expected to be recognized within 12 months from the reporting date is recorded as non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
We estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders with service providers, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed, the expected remaining period of performance and the associated expenses incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated expenses incurred, we may record net prepaid or accrued research and development expenses relating to these costs.
Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
contract research organizations and other vendors in connection with preclinical development and clinical studies;
•
contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors related to process development and manufacturing of materials for use in preclinical development and clinical studies; and
•
service providers for professional service fees such as consulting and other research and development related services.
Our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing may vary and may result in us reporting changes in estimates in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.
Stock-based Compensation
We account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all stock-based awards to employees and nonemployees to be recognized as expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards. Our stock-based awards include stock options granted to employees and nonemployees, restricted stock units granted to employees and shares issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plan.
Our stock-based awards may be subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the estimated grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable.
We have elected to not estimate forfeitures of stock-based awards and to account for forfeitures as they occur.
We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the fair value of the underlying common stock, (ii) the expected stock price volatility, (iii) the expected term of the award, (iv) the risk-free interest rate and (v) expected dividends. We do not have sufficient historical and implied volatility data for our common stock necessary to estimate the expected the volatility of our common stock over a period of time commensurate with the expected term of our stock option awards. As a result, we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of both our common stock and the common stock of a selected peer group of similar publicly traded companies for which sufficient historical volatility data is available. Due to the lack of historical volatility data for our common stock, we have historically placed a higher weight on the historical volatility of the selected peer group in estimating expected volatility and have increased the weight placed on the historical volatility of its common stock as more historical trading data has become available. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option awards. For the purpose of identifying the selected peer group companies, we consider characteristics such as enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and length of historical share price information. We plan to continue using historical peer group volatility data as an input to estimate expected volatility until a sufficient amount of historical volatility data for our common stock becomes available. We estimate the expected term of our employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, due to our lack of sufficient historical data. For stock options granted to nonemployees, we use the contractual term of the award rather than expected term to estimate the fair value of the award. We estimate the risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of its options based on the rates of U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates commensurate with the expected term of the associated awards. We assume a dividend yield of zero for our common stock as we have never paid dividends and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We estimate the fair value of our restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
Non-cash Interest Expense on Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties
We recorded a liability for the net proceeds received from the sale of our Zolgensma royalty payments to HCR. The liability is amortized over the estimated life of the arrangement using the effective interest method. The total amount of royalty payments received by HCR under the agreement, less the net proceeds we received from the sale, is recorded as non-cash interest expense over the life of the arrangement. We estimate the effective interest rate based on our estimate of total future royalty payments to be received by HCR under the agreement. We reassess these estimates at each reporting date and adjust the effective interest rate and amortization of the liability on a prospective basis as necessary.
Income Taxes
As of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $44.7 million, U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $79.7 million and federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $48.0 million (net of unrecognized tax benefits of $0.1 million) which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities. A portion of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2020 may be carried forward indefinitely, with the remaining portion expiring at various dates between 2034 and 2040.
Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual
limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. We have completed several financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control in the future.
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including our NOL and credit carryforwards. Based on our history of operating losses, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Results of Operations
Our consolidated results of operations were as follows:
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
License and Royalty Revenue. License and royalty revenue increased by $119.3 million, from $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $154.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:
•
an increase of $40.8 million in Zolgensma royalty revenue, from $20.8 million in 2019 to $61.6 million in 2020, as commercial sales of Zolgensma did not commence until the second quarter of 2019; and
•
an $80.0 million milestone payment recognized as revenue upon the achievement of $1.0 billion in cumulative net sales of Zolgensma in the third quarter of 2020. Upon the achievement of this milestone, there are no further development or sales-based milestones remaining under the associated license agreement with Novartis Gene Therapies for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA.
The decrease in license and royalty revenue from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to non-recurring license revenue recognized in 2018 of $176.1 million under our license agreement with Novartis Gene Therapies for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA, and $35.6 million under our November 2018 license agreement with Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Abeona). The decrease was partially offset by $20.8 million of Zolgensma royalty revenue recognized in 2019, as commercial sales of Zolgensma did not commence until the second quarter of 2019.
Research and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased by $42.1 million, from $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $166.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:
•
an increase of $13.2 million for personnel-related costs as a result of increased headcount of research and development personnel, including a $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense;
•
an increase of $12.2 million for external costs associated with manufacturing-related services to support the ongoing development of our product candidates and process development activities;
•
an increase of $11.3 million for external costs associated with clinical trial and regulatory activities for our lead product candidates;
•
an increase of $4.5 million for laboratory costs and facilities used by research and development personnel, including a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions; and
•
an increase of $2.5 million for external costs associated with preclinical studies and other early-stage research and development.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses increased by $12.0 million, from $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:
•
an increase of $8.8 million for professional services, primarily related to commercial consulting and legal services; and
•
an increase of $2.9 million for personnel-related costs as a result of increased headcount of general and administrative personnel, including a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.
Provision for Credit Losses and Other. Provision for credit losses and other increased by $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to a provision for credit losses of $7.7 million recognized in 2020 related to our accounts receivable from Abeona. As of December 31, 2020, we had recorded gross accounts receivable from Abeona of $30.1 million and a related allowance for credit losses of $7.7 million. For further information regarding the provision for credit losses, refer to Note 10, “License and Royalty Revenue-Abeona Therapeutics Inc.” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Investment Income. Investment income decreased by $38.8 million, from $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to net gains of $37.8 million recognized in 2019 related to our marketable equity securities of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail), as compared to net gains of $4.8 million recognized in 2020 related to these securities. We acquired the securities as consideration for a license to the NAV Technology Platform granted to Prevail in August 2017. Prevail completed its initial public offering (IPO) in June 2019, prior to which the securities were accounted for as non-marketable equity securities without a readily determinable fair value and had a carrying value of $0.4 million. Upon Prevail’s IPO in June 2019, the securities were reclassified to marketable securities and subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold all of our Prevail securities. The change in investment income
also includes a decrease of $6.0 million in interest income in 2020 as a result of reduced investments in marketable debt securities during the period.
Income Tax Benefit (Expense). Income tax expense increased by $8.0 million, from income tax benefit of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to income tax expense of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in U.S. state income taxes, largely driven by the sale of our Zolgensma royalties to HCR in 2020. The royalty purchase agreement was treated as a sale for income tax purposes, resulting in an unfavorable temporary difference in taxable income of $184.1 million in 2020 related to the transaction. The taxable income from the royalty sale resulted in current income tax expense in various states where our NOL carryforwards were insufficient to absorb the full amount of our taxable income for the period. Taxable income in 2020 was further increased by gains realized on the sale of our Prevail securities during the period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $522.5 million, which were primarily derived from the sale of our common stock, license and royalty revenue and the monetization of our Zolgensma royalty stream. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report, based on our current business plan. Our recent sources of liquidity include the following events and transactions:
•
In December 2020, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement with HCR to monetize a portion of our Zolgensma royalty stream. Under the agreement, we received a gross up-front payment of $200.0 million from HCR in December 2020. In exchange, HCR received the rights to a capped amount of Zolgensma royalty payments under our license agreement with Novartis Gene Therapies, including a portion of the royalty payments we received in the fourth quarter of 2020. The aggregate net proceeds received from the sale were $192.5 million, net of a $4.0 million deduction from the purchase price as payment for the pledged royalties we received in the fourth quarter of 2020 and other transaction costs payable by us.
•
Novartis Gene Therapies launched commercial sales of Zolgensma in the second quarter of 2019, upon which the we began recognizing royalty revenue on net sales of the licensed product. In accordance with the license agreement, Novartis Gene Therapies was obligated to pay a sales-based milestone fee of $80.0 million to us upon the achievement of $1.0 billion in cumulative net sales of licensed products. Novartis Gene Therapies achieved cumulative net sales of Zolgensma of $1.0 billion in third quarter of 2020 and we received payment of the $80.0 million milestone fee in October 2020. Upon the achievement of this milestone, there are no further development or sales-based milestones remaining under the associated license agreement with Novartis Gene Therapies for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA.
•
In August 2018, we completed a public offering of 3,105,000 shares of our common stock (inclusive of 405,000 shares pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $65.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters’ option exercise, were $189.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
In addition to the sources of liquidity listed above, in January 2021, we completed a public offering of 4,899,000 shares of our common stock (inclusive of 639,000 shares pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $47.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering, inclusive of the underwriters’ option exercise, were $216.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
We intend to devote the majority of our current capital to clinical development, seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates and capital expenditures to build out additional office, laboratory and manufacturing capacity, including the buildout of our future corporate, manufacturing and research headquarters at 9804 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of gene therapy product candidates, we are unable to estimate the total amount of operating expenditures and capital outlays necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. Additionally, our estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Furthermore, given the continuing uncertainty and volatile market and economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as potential for further effects due to a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, we will continue to monitor the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources.
Cash Flows
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $53.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven largely by an increase in revenues of $119.3 million in 2020, primarily attributable to Zolgensma royalties and the sales-based milestone payment of $80.0 million related to net sales of Zolgensma. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $89.6 million in 2020, primarily attributable to increased employee headcount and external research and development expenses. We expect to continue to incur net cash out outflows from operations for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and advancement of our lead product candidates and other research programs.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash used in operating activities of $54.1 million consisted of a net loss of $111.3 million, offset by $43.0 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $14.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expenses of $31.9 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $8.4 million and a provision for credit losses of $7.7 million related to our accounts receivable from Abeona. The changes in working capital include a $17.4 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which was largely driven by increases in sublicense fees payable to licensors, accrued external research and development expenses, income taxes payable and accrued personnel costs. The changes in working capital were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $9.9 million which was largely driven by an increase in Zolgensma royalties receivable as of December 31, 2020. Other changes in working capital were incurred in the normal course of business, primarily as a result of differences in the timing of payments to personnel and external service providers and the period in which such costs are incurred.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash used in operating activities of $107.7 million consisted of a net loss of $94.7 million, $7.6 million in adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital of $5.3 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of net gains on our marketable equity securities of Prevail of $37.8 million, imputed interest earned from our license agreements of $3.0 million and net accretion of discounts on marketable debt securities of $1.2 million, and were partially offset by stock-based compensation expenses of $26.9 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $7.2 million. The changes in working capital include an increase in accounts receivable of $8.6 million, which was largely driven by royalties on net sales of Zolgensma for the fourth quarter of 2019 recorded as accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019. Other changes in working capital were incurred in the normal course of business, primarily as a result of differences in the timing of payments to personnel and external service providers and the period in which such costs are incurred.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities consisted of $272.7 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by $123.0 million to purchase marketable securities and $26.9 million to purchase property and equipment. The majority of our capital expenditures in 2020 were related to the build out of our future corporate, manufacturing and research headquarters at 9804 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland. We expect capital expenditures to continue to increase in 2021 as a result of the continued build out of this facility. Total remaining capital expenditures related to the build out of the facility at 9804 Medical Center Drive, net of amounts to be reimbursed by the landlord under our tenant improvement allowance, are expected to be in the middle to upper double-digit millions (USD) and are expected to be incurred into 2022. However, the actual amount and timing of these capital expenditures are uncertain and may differ materially from our current estimates.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by investing activities consisted of $296.0 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by $190.7 million to purchase marketable securities and $11.7 million to purchase property and equipment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $192.8 million in net proceeds received from the sale of future Zolgensma royalties to HCR, net of transaction costs we paid during the period, and $7.4 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $8.4 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.
Future Funding Requirements
We have incurred cumulative losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of $289.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Our transition to recurring profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure, which depends heavily on the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We do not expect to achieve such revenues, and expect to continue to incur losses, for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Subject to obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Additionally, we expect our capital expenditures will continue to increase due to costs associated with building out additional office, laboratory and manufacturing capacity to further support the development of our product candidates and potential commercialization efforts, particularly with respect to the build out of our facility at 9804 Medical Center Drive as discussed above. As a result, we will need significant additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more equity offerings, debt financings or other third-party funding, including potential strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the timing of enrollment, commencement and completion of our clinical trials;
•
the results of our clinical trials;
•
the results of our preclinical studies for our product candidates and any subsequent clinical trials;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, laboratory testing, preclinical development and clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
the costs associated with building out additional laboratory and manufacturing capacity;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the costs of future product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
•
revenue received from commercial sales of Zolgensma and other revenue, if any, received in connection with commercial sales of our NAV Technology Licensees’ products, should any of their product candidates receive marketing approval;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;
•
our current licensing agreements or collaborations remaining in effect;
•
our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing agreements or collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.
Many of these factors are outside of our control. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory and marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenues, if any, and any commercial milestones or royalty payments under our licensing agreements, will be derived from or based on sales of products, the majority of which may not be commercially available for many years, if at all. In addition, revenue from our NAV Technology Platform sublicensing is dependent in part on the clinical and commercial success of our licensing partners. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.
The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property, our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
Our principal commitments include obligations under vendor contracts to provide research services and other purchase commitments with our vendors. In the normal course of business, we enter into services agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other third parties. Generally, these agreements provide for termination upon notice, with specified amounts due upon termination based on the timing of termination and the terms of the agreement. The actual amounts and timing of payments under these agreements are uncertain and contingent upon the initiation and completion of the services to be provided. These amounts are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.
Our commitments also include obligations to our licensors under our in-license agreements, which may include sublicense fees, milestones fees, royalties and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs. Sublicense fees are due to the licensors when we sublicense underlying intellectual property to third parties; the fees are based on a percentage of the license fees we receive from the sublicensees. Based on license fees we have received from sublicensees or recorded as accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020, we had accrued $2.5 million of sublicense fees payable to our licensors, of which $2.0 million was expected to be paid within 12 months and $0.5 million was expected to be paid in periods beyond 12 months. The actual amount of sublicense fees payable in future periods could differ materially if new licenses are granted to sublicensees, existing licenses are terminated by sublicensees or if certain other contingent consideration, such as milestone payments, is received from sublicensees in the future. Milestone fees are payable by us upon our future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Royalties are payable by us based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products. Maintenance costs are reimbursements to the licensors for maintaining licensed patents. Amounts due to our licensors in future periods are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.
Under the terms of our royalty purchase agreement with HCR, our future Zolgensma royalties, less amounts payable by us to certain licensors, will be payable to HCR up to a specified capped amount. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of future Zolgensma royalties to be paid to HCR under the agreement was $256.0 million if paid by November 7, 2024, or $296.0 million if paid after that date. We have no obligation to repay any amounts to HCR if total future Zolgensma royalty payments are not sufficient to repay these amounts. The amount and timing of these royalty payments are not fixed and determinable and therefore are not included in the table below.
We have entered into a number of long-term operating leases for office and laboratory space in Rockville, Maryland and New York, New York, as well as a number of laboratory and other equipment leases. The table below includes the future minimum lease payments under our lease agreements.
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, excluding the items discussed above related to vendor contracts, purchase commitments, license commitments and royalty sale obligations:
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
