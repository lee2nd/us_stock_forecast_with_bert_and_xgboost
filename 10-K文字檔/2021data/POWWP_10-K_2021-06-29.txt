Overview
Our vision is to modernize the ammunition industry by bringing new technologies to market. We intend to do that through acquisition and application of intellectual property that is unique to the industry and through investing in manufacturing equipment and processes that enable us to compete globally.
Our innovative line of match grade armor piercing (AP) and hard armor piercing incendiary (HAPI) tactical rounds are the centerpiece of the Company’s strategy to address the unique needs of the armed forces community. This ammunition was designed around a match grade portfolio of projectiles, that include a solid copper boat tail and armor piercing configuration. The distinction between these rounds and other sold, is that the manufacturing process was engineered to ensure extremely tight tolerances between each projectile manufactured, ensuring for the end user that the ballistic trajectory remains consistent between rounds without regard to the actual configuration or round fired. Our AP and HAPI line is also available with our O.W.L. Technology™. The Company has aligned its manufacturing operations to support the large caliber demand from military personnel, such as the 12.7 mm and .50 caliber BMG configurations. On February 2, 2021, we announced that we restarted our improved .50 caliber manufacturing line to address increased market demand and fulfill current orders.
Through JMC, we offer ammunition casings for pistol ammunition through large rifle ammunition. Jagemann Munitions Components is backed by decades of manufacturing experience that allows the production of high-quality pistol brass and rifle brass components. Borne from the automotive industry and refined over time to deliver durable and consistent sporting components, Jagemann™ Casings, has become one of the largest brass manufacturers in the country, with the capacity to produce more than 750 million pieces of brass each year with the ability to scale to 1 billion rounds on an annual basis.. Proud of its American-made components and capabilities, the Company now has complete control over the manufacturing process. This results in a number of advantages when it comes to the brass that leaves our state-of-the-art facility.
On April 30, 2021, we acquired Gemini and nine of its subsidiaries, all of which are related to Gemini’s ownership of the Gunbroker.com business.
GunBroker.com is a large online marketplace dedicated to firearms, hunting, shooting and related products. Aside from merchandise bearing its logo, GunBroker.com currently sells none of the items listed on its website. Third-party sellers list items on the site and federal and state laws govern the sale of firearms and other restricted items. Ownership policies and regulations are followed using licensed firearms dealers as transfer agents.
The focus for our 2022 fiscal year is to continue to expand our brand presence into the markets identified above and to continue to grow our sales within our targeted markets. We intend to do this through establishing key strategic relationships, enrolling in government procurement programs, establishing relationships with leading law enforcement associations and programs, expanding distributor channels, and revitalized marketing campaigns.
Results of Operations
Our financial results for the year ended March 31, 2021 reflect our newly positioned organization. We believe that we have hired a strong team of professionals, developed innovative products, and continue to raise capital sufficient to establish our presence as a high-quality ammunition provider. We continue to focus on growing our top line revenue, and streamlining our operations, and we experienced an increase in our gross profit margin for the year ended March 31, 2021. This was the result of a significant increase in sales allowing us to cover a greater percentage of our fixed manufacturing costs, which include our non-cash amortization and depreciation expense.
The following table presents summarized financial information taken from our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared with the year ended March 31, 2020:
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze operational and financial data to evaluate our business, allocate our resources, and assess our performance. In addition to total net sales, net income (loss), and other results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following information includes key operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our business. We believe these measures are useful for period-to-period comparisons of the Company. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are key measures we use to evaluate our operational performance, produce future strategies for our operations, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of our resources. Accordingly, we believe these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measures that displays our net loss, adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described below.
We have excluded the following non-cash expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures: depreciation and amortization, interest expense, excise taxes, loss on purchase, share-based compensation expenses, other income, and changes to the contingent consideration fair value. We believe it is useful to exclude these non-cash expenses because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations.
Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure also excludes other cash interest income and expense, as these items are not components of our core operations. We have not included adjustment for any provision or benefit for income taxes as we currently record a valuation allowance and we have included adjustment for excise taxes.
Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:
●
Employee stock awards and stock grants expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company and an important part of our compensation strategy;
● the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or other capital commitments; and
● non-GAAP measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs
● other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures
Because of these limitations, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including our net loss and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.
Net Sales
The following table shows our net sales by proprietary ammunition versus standard ammunition for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020. “Proprietary Ammunition” include those lines of ammunition manufactured by our facilities that are sold under the brand names: STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™, One Precise Shot (OPS), Night Ops, Jesse James, Jeff Rann, and Stelth. We define “Standard Ammunition” as non-proprietary ammunition that directly competes with other brand manufacturers. Our “Standard Ammunition” is manufactured within our facility and may also include completed ammunition that has been acquired in the open market for sale to others. Also included in this category is low cost target pistol and rifle ammunition, as well as bulk packaged ammunition manufactured by us using reprocessed brass casings. Ammunition within this product line typically carries much lower gross margins.
Sales for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased 323% or $47,701,965, over the year ended March 31, 2020. This increase was the result of approximately $40.7 million of increased sales in bulk pistol and rifle ammunition, an increase of approximately $2.3 million of respective sales of Proprietary Ammunition and an increase of approximately $4.7 million of sales from our casing operations. Management expects the sales of Proprietary Ammunition to outpace the sales of our Standard Ammunition.
We are focused on continuing to grow top line revenue quarter-over-quarter as we continue to further expand distribution into commercial markets, introduce new product lines, and continue to initiate sales to U.S. law enforcement, military, and international markets.
We added ammunition casings to our product offerings at March 15, 2019 and expect the ammunition casing sales to continue to be a significant part of our sales moving forward.
Through our acquisition of SWK, the Company has developed and deployed a new line of tactical armor piercing (AP) and hard armor piercing incendiary (HAPI) precision ammunition to meet the lethality requirements of both the US and foreign military customers. This line was formally launched at SHOT Show in Las Vegas, where our team demonstrated or presented the capability to more than 15 countries around the world. We continue to demonstrate our AP and HAPI ammunition to military personnel at scheduled and invite only events, resulting in increased interest and procurement discussions.
It is important to note that, although U.S. law enforcement, military and international markets represent significant opportunities for our company, they also have a long sales cycle. The Company’s sales team has been effective in establishing sales and distribution channels, both in the United States and abroad, which are reasonably anticipated to drive sustained sales opportunity in the military, law enforcement, and commercial markets.
Sales outside of the United States require licenses and approval from either the U.S. Department of Commerce or the U.S. State Department, which typically takes approximately 30 days to receive. On July 21, 2020, we renewed our annual registration with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which remains valid through the report date. This permits the Company to export and broker ammunition and other controlled items covered under ITAR.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold increased by approximately $32.6 million from $18.5 million to $51.1 million, respectively for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. This was the result of a significant increase in net sales as well increases to non-cash depreciation related to our newly acquired casing operations, expensing of increased labor, overhead, and raw materials used to produce finished product during 2020 as compared to 2019. As a percentage of sales, cost of goods sold decreased by 34.5% when comparing the year ended March 31, 2021 to the year ended March 31, 2020.
Gross Margin
Our gross margin percentage increased to 18.2% from -24.9% during the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. This was a result of increased sales allowing us to cover a greater percentage of our fixed manufacturing costs, which include our non-cash amortization and depreciation expense.
We believe as we continue to grow sales through new markets and expanded distribution that our gross margins will also increase, as evidenced by the improvement over this time last year. Our goal in the next 12 to 24 months is to continue to improve our gross margins. This will be accomplished through the following:
● Increased product sales, specifically of proprietary lines of ammunition, like the STREAK VISUAL AMMUNITION™, OPS, Stelth and now our tactical Armor Piercing (AP) and Hard Armor Piercing Incendiary (HAPI) precision ammunition, all of which carry higher margins as a percentage of their selling price;
● Introduction of new lines of ammunition that historically carry higher margins in the consumer and government sectors;
● Reduced component costs through acquisition our recent casing operation acquisition and expansion of strategic relationships with component providers;
● Expanded use of automation equipment that reduces the total labor required to assemble finished products
● And, better leverage of our fixed costs through expanded production to support the sales objectives.
Operating Expenses
Overall, for the year ended March 31, 2021, our operating expenses increased by approximately $6.6 million over the year ended March 31, 2020, but decreased as a percentage of sales from 68.8% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 26.8% for the year ended March 31, 2021. The increase was related to a non-cash adjustment to recognize a loss on $1.0 million of Construction in Progress that the Company had previously agreed to exchange with Jagemann Stamping Company, as well as increases in Operating Expenses from our increases in Net Sales and from our efforts to uplist to Nasdaq. Our operating expenses included of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $1.7 million. Our operating expenses consisted of cost for the expansion our sales and support team, stock compensation expense associated with issuance of our Common Stock in lieu of cash compensation for employees, board members, and key consultants for the organization during the period, and trade show and marketing costs associated with introducing our lines of ammunition. Operating expenses for the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2020 included noncash expenses of approximately $6.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. We also experienced increases as a result of new investor and public relations programs, and professional fees associated with our acquisition activity, our public filings, and our efforts to uplist the Company from the OTC to Nasdaq. We expect to see administrative expenditures to continue to decrease as a percentage of sales in the 2021 fiscal year, as we leverage our work force and expand our sales opportunities.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, our selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately $687,000. The increase was primarily related to commission on the increases in the sale of our products resulting of approximately $1.4 million of increase in commissions and a reduction in our advertising expenses of approximately $306,000 for the year ended March 31, 2021 in comparison to the comparable prior year.
Our corporate general & administrative expenses increased approximately $3.5 million in the current period from the prior year mainly due to increased professional and legal fees, which included noncash stock compensation of $1.7 million and a decrease related to a noncash fair value adjustment to Contingent Consideration of approximately $119,000.
Employee salaries and related expenses increased approximately $1.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the comparable period ended in 2020. This was a result of increased payroll and related expenses of $1.1 million and employee stock compensation of approximately $292,000.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately $60,000 from the period due to the addition of assets.
Interest and Other Expenses
For the year ended March 31, 2021, interest expense increased by approximately $2.3 million compared with the comparable year ended March 31, 2020. The change from the prior period was mainly due to approximately $1.3 million of non-cash interest expense recognized on the issuance of warrants to purchase Common Stock, approximately $446,000 debt discount amortization related to Convertible Promissory Notes as well as increases in interest expense and debt discount amortization related to Note Payables Related Party, Note Payable, and Convertible Promissory Notes. Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2020 included $121,000 of non-cash debt discount amortization related to the Convertible Promissory Notes.
Net Loss
As a result of higher production, selling, and payroll expenses, we ended the year ended March 31, 2021 with net losses of approximately $7.8 million compared with net losses of approximately $14.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.
Our goal is to continue to improve our operating results as we focus on increasing sales and controlling our operating expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2021, we had $118,341,471 of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $117,457,197 from March 31, 2020.
Existing working capital, cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, and sales of equity and debt securities are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next year. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of stock sales, bank financings, and related-party notes.
Working Capital is summarized and compared as follows:
Changes in cash flows are summarized as follows:
Operating Activities

Contractual Obligations
The Company’s contractual obligations by maturity as of March 31, 2021 are as follows:
(1) Note repayment made subsequent to March 31, 2021.
(2) Contingent consideration is to be paid upon achievement of specific milestones. The date of payment included herein is based upon management estimates.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of March 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, net sales, expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures, or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounted of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We have identified several accounting principles that we believe are key to the understanding of our financial statements. These important accounting policies require our most difficult subjective judgements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the valuation of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of inventories, useful lives of assets, intangible assets, and stock-based compensation.
Inventory
We state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost by using the weighted-average cost of raw materials method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method and includes allocations of manufacturing labor and overhead. We make provisions when necessary, to reduce excess, potential damaged or obsolete inventories. These provisions are based on our best estimates. At March 31, 2021, and March 31, 2020, we conducted a full analysis of inventory on hand and expensed all inventory not currently in use, or for which there was no future demand.
Research and Development
To date, we have expensed all costs associated with developing our product specifications, manufacturing procedures, and products through our cost of products sold, as this work was done by the same employees who produced the finished product. We anticipate that it may become necessary to reclassify research and development costs into our operating expenditures for reporting purposes as we begin to develop new technologies and lines of ammunition.
Revenue Recognition
We generate revenue from the production and sale of ammunition. We recognize revenue according to ASC 606. When the customer obtains control over the promised goods or services, we record revenue in the amount of consideration that we can expect to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model to determine revenue recognition:
● Identification of a contract with a customer
● Identification of the performance obligations in the contact
● determination of the transaction price
● allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance allocation
● recognition of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied
The Company only applies the five-step model when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception and once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Our contracts contain a single performance obligation and the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. We recognize as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Accordingly, we recognize revenues (net) when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which typically occurs upon shipment of the product. In the current period, the Company began accepting contract liabilities or Unearned Revenue. We included Unearned Revenue in our accrued liabilities. The Company will recognize revenue when the performance obligation is met.
Excise Tax
As a result of regulations imposed by the Federal Government for sales of ammunition to non-government U.S. entities, we charge and collect an 11% excise tax for all products sold into these channels. During the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $4,286,258 and $643,735, respectively, in excise taxes. For ease in selling to commercial markets, excise tax is included in our unit price for the products sold. We record this through net sales and expense the offsetting tax expense to cost of goods sold.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to us as of March 31, 2021. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair value. These financial instruments include cash, accounts payable, and amounts due to related parties. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.
Income Taxes
We follow ASC subtopic 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes” for recording the provision for income taxes. ASC 740-10 requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggest that is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
Stock-Based Compensation
We grant stock-based compensation to key employees and directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. We also grant stock in lieu of cash compensation for key consultants and service providers. We recognize expense related to stock-based payment transactions in which we receive employee or non-employee services in exchange for equity. We measure stock compensation based on the closing fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant.
In addition to our base of employees, we also use the services of several contract personnel and other professionals on an “as needed basis”. We plan to continue to use consultants, legal and patent attorneys, engineers and accountants as necessary. We may also expand our staff to support the market roll-out of our products to both the commercial and government related organizations. A portion of any key employee compensation likely would include direct stock grants, which would dilute the ownership interest of holders of existing shares of our Common Stock.
