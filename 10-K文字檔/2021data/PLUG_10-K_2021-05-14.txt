Overview
Plug Power is facilitating the paradigm shift to an increasingly electrified world by innovating cutting-edge hydrogen and fuel cell solutions. In our core business, we provide and continue to develop commercially-viable hydrogen and fuel cell product solutions to replace lead-acid batteries in electric material handling vehicles and industrial trucks for some of the world’s largest retail-distribution and manufacturing businesses. We are focusing our efforts on industrial mobility applications, including electric forklifts and electric industrial vehicles, at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits. Additionally, we manufacture and sell fuel cell products to replace batteries and diesel generators in stationary backup power applications. These products have proven valuable with telecommunications, transportation, and utility customers as robust, reliable, and sustainable power solutions.
Part of our long-term plan includes Plug Power penetrating the on-road vehicle market and large-scale stationary market. Plug Power’s announcements to form joint ventures with Renault in Europe and SK Group in Asia not only support this goal but are expected to provide us with a more global footprint. Plug has been successful with acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures, and we plan to continue this mix. For example, we expect our relationships with Brookfield and Apex to provide us access to low-cost renewable energy, which is critical to low-cost green hydrogen.
Our current products and services include:
GenDrive: GenDrive is our hydrogen fueled PEM fuel cell system providing power to material handling electric vehicles, including class 1, 2, 3 and 6 electric forklifts, AGVs and ground support equipment;
GenFuel: GenFuel is our liquid hydrogen fueling delivery, generation, storage, and dispensing system;
GenCare: GenCare is our ongoing ‘internet of things’-based maintenance and on-site service program for GenDrive fuel cell systems, GenSure fuel cell systems, GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products and ProGen fuel cell engines;
GenSure: GenSure is our stationary fuel cell solution providing scalable, modular PEM fuel cell power to support the backup and grid-support power requirements of the telecommunications, transportation, and utility sectors; GenSure High Power Fuel Cell Platform will support large scale stationary power and data center markets.
GenKey: GenKey is our vertically integrated “turn-key” solution combining either GenDrive or GenSure fuel cell power with GenFuel fuel and GenCare aftermarket service, offering complete simplicity to customers transitioning to fuel cell power;
ProGen: ProGen is our fuel cell stack and engine technology currently used globally in mobility and stationary fuel cell systems, and as engines in electric delivery vans. This includes the Plug Power MEA, a critical component of the fuel cell stack used in zero-emission fuel cell electric vehicle engines; and
GenFuel Electrolyzers: GenFuel electrolyzers are modular, scalable hydrogen generators optimized for clean hydrogen production. Electrolyzers generate hydrogen from water using electricity and a special membrane and “green” hydrogen is generated by using renewable energy inputs, such as solar or wind power.
We provide our products worldwide through our direct product sales force, and by leveraging relationships with OEMs and their dealer networks. Plug Power is targeting Asia and Europe for expansion in adoption. Europe has rolled out ambitious targets for the hydrogen economy and Plug Power is executing on its strategy to become one of the European leaders. This includes a targeted account strategy for material handling as well as securing strategic partnerships with European OEMs, energy companies, utility leaders and accelerating our electrolyzer business. We manufacture our commercially viable products in Latham, New York, Rochester, New York and Spokane, Washington and support liquid hydrogen generation and logistics in Charleston, Tennessee.
Recent Developments
COVID-19 Update
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, state governments-including those in New York and Washington, where our manufacturing facilities are located-have issued orders requiring businesses that do not conduct essential services to temporarily close their physical workplaces to employees and customers. We are currently deemed an essential business and, as a result, are exempt from these state orders, in their current form. In March 2020, we put in place a number of protective measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These measures include the canceling of all commercial air travel and all other non-critical travel, requesting that employees limit non-essential personal travel, eliminating all but essential third-party access to our facilities, enhancing our facilities’ janitorial and sanitary procedures, encouraging employees to work from home to the extent their job function enables them to do so, encouraging the use of virtual employee meetings, and providing staggered shifts and social distancing measures for those employees associated with manufacturing and service operations.
We cannot predict at this time the full extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results and financial condition, which will depend on many factors. We are staying in close communication with our manufacturing facilities, employees, customers, suppliers and partners, and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Although as of the date hereof, we have not observed any material impacts to our supply of components, the situation is fluid. Many of the parts for our products are sourced from suppliers in China and the manufacturing situation in China remains variable. Supply chain disruptions could reduce the availability of key components, increase prices or both. Certain of our customers, such as Walmart, significantly increased their use of units and hydrogen fuel consumption as a result of COVID-19. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our services and PPA margins were negatively impacted by incremental service costs associated with increased usage of units at some of our primary customer sites. In addition, future changes in applicable government orders or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing orders or regulations, could result in further disruptions to our business that may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Borrowings, Capital Raises and Strategic Investments
On February 24, 2021, the Company completed the previously announced sale of its common stock in connection with a strategic partnership with SK Holdings Co., Ltd. (“SK Holdings”) to accelerate the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in Asian markets. The Company sold 54,966,188 shares of its common stock to a subsidiary of SK Holdings at a purchase price of $29.2893 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion.
In January and February 2021, the Company issued and sold in a registered equity offering an aggregate of 32.2 million shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $65.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion.
In November 2020, the Company issued and sold in a registered equity offering an aggregate of 43,700,000 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $22.25 per share for net proceeds of approximately $927.3 million.
In each of July and September 2020, the Company borrowed an additional $25.0 million under an amended loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Generate Lending, LLC (“Generate Capital”).
In August 2020, the Company issued and sold in a registered equity offering an aggregate of 35,276,250 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $10.25 per share for net proceeds of approximately $344.4 million.
In May 2020, the Company issued $212.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes. The total net proceeds from this offering after deducting costs of the issuance were $205.1 million. See Note 15, “Convertible Senior Notes, as restated” for more details. The Company used $90.2 million of the net proceeds to purchase $66.3 million of its 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes.
Governance
On February 18, 2021, the Company’s Board appointed Kimberly A. Harriman as a director and as a member of the Audit Committee of the Board. On February 24, 2021, in connection with the closing of the SK Holdings investment, the Board appointed Kyungyeol Song as a director of the Company. Each of Ms. Harriman and Mr. Song has been designated as a Class III director to serve until the Company's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
On May 13, 2021, the Board amended and restated the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Bylaws in order to clarify and update certain provisions as well as to (i) expressly provide for virtual stockholder meetings by remote communication (Article I, Section 4), (ii) eliminate the requirement to provide notice of any adjourned meeting of the Board (Article II, Section 9), (iii) provide that shares of all classes or series of the Company’s stock may be uncertificated (Article IV, Section 1), and (iv) designate the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive jurisdiction for any litigation arising under the Securities Act (Article VI, Section 8) (the “Amended and Restated Bylaws”). The Board approved the Amended and Restated Bylaws, among other reasons, to align them with current governance practices and, in respect of the exclusive federal forum provision, in order to seek to reduce any potential expenses that the Company may incur in connection with any actions or proceedings by seeking to avoid the Company being required to defend any such potential actions or proceedings in multiple jurisdictions and in parallel proceedings in federal and state courts simultaneously.
Amazon Warrant
In 2017, the Company issued the Amazon Warrant to acquire up to 55,286,696 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Amazon Warrant Shares”). On December 31, 2020, the Company waived the remaining vesting conditions under the Amazon Warrant, which resulted in the immediate vesting of the 20,368,784 unvested third tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares and recognition of a $399.7 million reduction to revenue associated with 18,085,395 of the third tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares for which reduction of revenue had not been previously recognized as a reduction of revenue.
The $399.7 million reduction to revenue resulting from the December 31, 2020 waiver was determined based upon a probability assessment of whether the Amazon Warrant Shares would vest under the terms of the original Amazon Warrant. Based upon the Company’s projections of probable future cash collections from Amazon (i.e., a Type I share based payment modification), a reduction of revenue of $56.6 million associated with 5,354,905 Amazon Warrant Shares was recognized at their previously measured November 2, 2020 fair value of $10.57 per share. A reduction of revenue of $343.1 associated with the remaining 12,730,490 Amazon Warrant Shares was recognized at their December 31, 2020 fair value of $26.95 each, based upon the Company’s assessment that associated future cash collections from Amazon were not deemed probable (i.e., a Type III share based payment modification).
The $399.7 million reduction to revenue was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 because the Company concluded such amount was not recoverable from the margins expected under probable future revenues attributable to Amazon, and no exclusivity or other rights were conferred to the Company in connection with the December 31, 2020 waiver. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a reduction to the provision for warrants of $12.8 million in connection with the release of the service loss accrual.
Provision for Common Stock Warrants
In 2017, in separate transactions, the Company issued to each of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC and Walmart, Inc. (“Walmart”) warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company recorded a portion
of the estimated fair value of the warrants as a reduction of revenue based upon the projected number of shares of common stock expected to vest under the warrants, the proportion of purchases by Amazon, Walmart and their affiliates within the period relative to the aggregate purchase levels required for vesting of the respective warrants, and the then-current fair value of the warrants. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2019-08, with retrospective adoption as of January 1, 2019. As a result, the amount recorded as a reduction of revenue was measured based on the grant-date fair value of the warrants. Previously, this amount was measured based on vesting date fair value with estimates of fair value determined at each financial reporting date for unvested warrant shares considered to be probable of vesting. Except for the third tranche, all existing unvested warrants are measured using a measurement date of January 1, 2019, the adoption date, in accordance with ASU 2019-08. For the third tranche of the shares under Walmart’s warrant, the exercise price will be determined once the second tranche vests. For the third tranche of the Amazon Warrant Shares, see above for the exercise price and measurement dates used.
The amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, is shown in the table below (in thousands):
Results of Operations
Our primary sources of revenue are from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, PPAs, and fuel delivered to customers. Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. Revenue from PPAs primarily represents payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the Company’s GenKey solution. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated on site.
Net revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit/(loss) and gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 as restated, and 2018, as restated, were as follows (in thousands):
Net Revenue
Revenue - sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue from the sale of our fuel cells, such as GenDrive units and GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure referred to at the site level as hydrogen installations. Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $244.2 million, or 162.9%, to ($94.3) million from $149.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as restated for 2019. Included within revenue was provision for common stock warrants of $331.1 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The main driver for the decrease in revenue was the increase in provision for common stock warrants which resulted from the accelerated vesting of the third tranche of the Amazon Warrant Shares. See “Amazon Transaction Agreement”, below. This increased level of provision for common stock warrants is not expected to continue because the Amazon Warrant is fully vested. Offsetting the decrease in revenue was an increase in hydrogen installations related to one significant customer. There were 27 hydrogen fueling infrastructure sites during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to four in 2019. Also partially offsetting the revenue decrease was an increase in GenDrive units recognized as revenue. There were 9,418 GenDrive units recognized as revenue in 2020 as compared to 6,058 in 2019. We continue to enhance our GenDrive units, resulting in lower maintenance costs, higher run times, and greater efficiency. These enhancements have resulted in higher demand for our GenDrive product as well as higher sales prices. In addition, the Company continues to broaden its customer portfolio. Pricing varies amongst customers depending on application and in general the Company has been able to increase average selling prices for GenDrive units by broadening small to medium size customers, resulting in fewer volume discounts.
Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $42.7 million (as restated), or 39.9% (as restated), to $149.9 million (as restated) from $107.2 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included within revenue was provision for common stock warrants of $2.0 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The main drivers for the increase in revenue were the increase in GenDrive units recognized as revenue, change in product mix and variations in customer programs, as well as a decrease in the aforementioned provision for common stock warrants. There were 6,058 GenDrive units
recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4,426 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in GenDrive revenue was partially offset by a decrease in hydrogen fueling infrastructure installations. There were four sites associated with hydrogen fueling infrastructure revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 17 during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Revenue - services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $35.0 million, or 138.9%, to ($9.8) million from $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as restated for 2019. Included within revenue from services was provision for common stock warrants of $36.0 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The main driver for the decrease in revenue was the increase in provision for common stock warrants which resulted from the accelerated vesting of the third tranche of the Amazon Warrant Shares. See “Amazon Transaction Agreement” below. This increased level of provision for common stock warrants is not expected to continue because the Amazon Warrant is fully vested. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenue was an increase in average number of GenDrive units under maintenance contracts. The average number of GenDrive units under maintenance contracts during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 12,417 compared to 11,485 in 2019. We continue to enhance our GenDrive units, which has resulted in higher demand for our GenDrive product, as well as higher sales prices.
Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $3.2 million, or 14.6%, to $25.2 million (as restated) from $22.0 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included within revenue from services was provision for common stock warrants of $0.8 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, contributing to the increase in revenue. The average number of units under extended maintenance contracts during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 11,485, compared to 11,035 during the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in the average number of units serviced in 2019 coupled with favorable changes in mix drove the increase in revenue during the period.
Revenue - Power Purchase Agreements. Revenue from PPAs represents payments received from customers for power generated through the provision of equipment and service. Revenue from PPAs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $1.1 million, or 4.2%, to $26.6 million from $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated). Included within revenue was provision for common stock warrants of $2.8 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in the average number of units and customer sites party to these agreements. There was an average of 15,469 units under PPAs generating revenue in 2020, compared to 10,478 in 2019. The average number of sites under PPA arrangements was 39 in 2020, compared to 33 in 2019. The revenue increase from additional units and sites was partially offset by the increase in provision for common stock warrants. We continue to enhance our GenDrive units, which has resulted in higher demand for our GenDrive product. In addition, the Company continues to broaden its customer portfolio. We added a significant customer that uses PPA for our equipment in the second half of 2020, also contributing to an increase in revenue year over year.
Revenue from PPAs for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $3.0 million (as restated), or 13.2% (as restated), to $25.6 million (as restated) from $22.6 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included within revenue was provision for common stock warrants of $1.5 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in revenue from PPAs for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was attributable to the increase in the number of units under PPA arrangements, partially offset by the increase in provision for common stock warrants. The remaining increase was due to the increased number of sites the Company had deployed under PPA arrangements. The average number of sites under PPA arrangements was 39 in 2019, as compared to 30 in 2018. The 18.2% increase in the average number of sites under PPA arrangements for the year December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was relatively consistent with the increase in revenue during the same period, partially offset by the increase in provision for common stock warrants.
Revenue - fuel delivered to customers. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated on site. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $45.2 million, or 155.2%, to ($16.1) million from $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated). Included within revenue was provision for common stock warrants of $55.2 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. The main driver for the decrease in revenue was the increase in provision for common stock warrants which resulted from the accelerated vesting of the third tranche of the Amazon Warrant Shares. See “Amazon Warrant Transaction Agreement” above. This increased level of provision for common stock warrants is not expected to continue because the Amazon Warrant is fully vested. Partially offsetting the provision of common stock warrants was an increase in fueling sites under contracts. There were 103 sites associated with fuel contracts at December 31, 2020, compared to 76 at December 31, 2019. This is consistent with the increased sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure sales as well as increases in the level of deployment of PPA sites.
Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $6.6 million, or 29.5%, to $29.1 million (as restated) from $22.5 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included within revenue was provision for common stock warrants of $2.2 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, contributing to the increase in revenue. The remaining increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in sites taking fuel deliveries in 2019, compared to 2018, as well as an increase in the price of fuel. The average number of sites receiving fuel deliveries was 76 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 62 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue - sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. Cost of revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure includes direct materials, labor costs, and allocated overhead costs related to the manufacture of our fuel cells such as GenDrive units and GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure referred to at the site level as hydrogen installations.
Cost of revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $73.5 million, or 75.1%, to $171.4 million, compared to $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated). This increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of GenDrive units recognized as revenue, as well as an increase in hydrogen infrastructure installations recognized as revenue. There were 9,418 GenDrive units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 6,058 for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were 27 sites associated with hydrogen fueling infrastructure revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross margin generated from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure was (281.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2020, down from 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated), due primarily to the increase in provision for common stock warrants which resulted from the accelerated vesting of the third tranche of the Amazon Warrant Shares. See “Amazon Transaction Agreement” below. This increased level of provision for common stock warrants is not expected to continue because the Amazon Warrant is fully vested.
Cost of revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $12.7 million (as restated), or 14.9% (as restated), to $97.9 million (as restated), compared to $85.2 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of GenDrive units recognized as revenue, partially offset by the decrease in hydrogen infrastructure installations recognized as revenue. There were 6,058 GenDrive units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4,426 for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were 4 sites associated with hydrogen fueling infrastructure revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 17 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross margin generated from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure was 34.7% (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2019, up from 20.5% (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in GenDrive units recognized as revenue and decrease in the number of hydrogen infrastructure sites deployed, as well as a reduction of provision for common stock warrants.
Cost of revenue - services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. Cost of revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure includes the labor, material costs and allocated overhead costs incurred for our product service and hydrogen site maintenance contracts and spare parts. Cost of revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $7.9 million, or 23.0%, from $34.6 million to $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated) primarily due to an increase in the number of units under maintenance contracts. There were 12,417 units under maintenance contracts generating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 11,485 for the year ended December 31, 2019, on average. Gross margin declined to (533.9)% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to (37.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in provision for common stock warrants which resulted from the
accelerated vesting of the third tranche of the Amazon Warrant Shares. See “Amazon Transaction Agreement” below. This increased level of provision for common stock warrants is not expected to continue because the Amazon Warrant is fully vested. Additionally, there were increased costs as a result of additional usage due to COVID-19 run hour requirements at customer sites, as well as increased costs due to investments related to stack performance. These stack enhancements are expected to decrease service costs in the future.
Cost of revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $2.3 million, or 7.2% (as restated), from $32.3 million (as restated) to $34.6 million (restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross margin improved to (37.1%) (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to (46.7%) (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to program investments targeting performance improvement and variation in maintenance cycles.
Cost of revenue - provision for loss accrual. The Company recorded a provision for loss accrual during 2020 of $35.5 million, an increase of $35.9 million over the net benefit for loss contracts related to service recorded in 2019 of $394 thousand (as restated). The increase in the provision for loss accrual during 2020 was driven primarily by an increase in estimated projected costs to service units and an increase in the number of service contracts during 2020. The Company determined during 2020, based on historical experience, that certain cost down initiatives were taking longer to achieve than originally estimated. As a result, the Company increased its estimated projected costs to service fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. Additionally, the Company determined during the third quarter of 2020 that the projected provision for the Amazon Warrant would be significantly higher than previously experienced (see discussion of the Amazon Transaction Agreement). Lastly, the Company entered into 19 new service contracts during 2020, compared to one new service contract in 2019.
The Company recorded a net benefit for loss accrual during 2019 of $394 thousand (as restated), a decrease of $5.7 million (as restated) over the provision recorded in 2018 of $5.3 million (as restated). The decrease in the provision for loss accrual during 2019 was driven primarily by the passage of time on the contract portfolio and limited number of new contracts in 2019. The Company entered into one new service contract during 2019, compared to five new service contracts in 2018.
Cost of revenue - Power Purchase Agreements. Cost of revenue from PPAs includes depreciation of assets utilized and service costs to fulfill PPA obligations and interest costs associated with certain financial institutions for leased equipment. Cost of revenue from PPAs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $22.9 million, or 54.7%, to $64.6 million from $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as restated. The increase in cost was a result of an increase in the average number of units and customer sites party to these agreements. There was an average of 15,469 units under PPAs recognized as revenue in 2020, compared to 10,478 in 2019. The average number of sites under PPA arrangements was 39 in 2020, compared to 33 in 2019. Gross margin declined to (142.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to (63.5)% for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increase in provision for common stock warrants and increase in costs related to greater utilization of GenDrive units at a significant customer site, due to higher demand on customer warehouse equipment as a result of COVID-19.
Cost of revenue from PPAs for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $0.4 million (as restated), or 1.0% (as restated), to $41.8 million (as restated) from $41.4 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was a result of an increase in the number of customer sites party to these agreements. Gross margin improved to (63.5%) (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to (83.3%) (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to reliability improvements and increased labor leverage on a growing fleet, which resulted in improved service cost per unit.
Cost of revenue - fuel delivered to customers. Cost of revenue from fuel delivered to customers represents the purchase of hydrogen from suppliers that ultimately is sold to customers. Cost of revenue from fuel delivered to customers for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $16.6 million, or 36.6%, to $61.8 million from $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as restated. The increase was due primarily to higher volume of liquid hydrogen delivered to customer sites as a result of an increase in the number of hydrogen installations completed under GenKey agreements and higher fuel costs. There were 103 sites associated with fuel contracts at December 31, 2020, compared to 76 at December 31, 2019. Gross margin declined to (484.6)% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to (55.5)% during the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated), primarily due to the increase in provision for common stock warrants which resulted from the accelerated vesting of the third tranche of the Amazon Warrant Shares. See “Amazon Transaction Agreement” below. This increased level of provision for common stock warrants is not expected to continue because the Amazon Warrant is fully vested. The Company also experienced an increase in the cost of fuel purchased during the second
half of 2020 given issues with a particular supplier. This trend is not expected to continue beyond 2021 as the Company transitions to its own hydrogen production capabilities.
Cost of revenue from fuel delivered to customers for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $9.2 million (as restated), or 25.6% (as restated), to $45.2 million (as restated) from $36.0 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to higher volume of liquid hydrogen delivered to customer sites as a result of an increase in the number of hydrogen installations completed under GenKey agreements and higher fuel costs. Gross margin improved to (55.5%) (as restated) during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to (60.4%) (as restated) during the year ended December 31, 2018 given certain efficiency investments and reduction in customer warrant provisions offset somewhat by increases in fuel costs and incremental depreciation on tanks and related fuel equipment stemming from investments made to improve fuel system efficiency.
Expenses
Research and development expense. Research and development expense includes: materials to build development and prototype units, cash and non-cash compensation and benefits for the engineering and related staff, expenses for contract engineers, fees paid to consultants for services provided, materials and supplies consumed, facility related costs such as computer and network services, and other general overhead costs associated with our research and development activities.
Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $12.8 million, or 84.9%, to $27.8 million from $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as restated. The increase was primarily due to additional research and development for improvement of fuel efficiency, GenDrive unit performance, and new product development such as on-road delivery trucks, and drone applications.
Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $2.3 million (as restated), or 18.1% (as restated), to $15.1 million (as restated) from $12.8 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to additional research and development for fuel efficiency, GenDrive unit performance, and new product development such as on-road delivery trucks, drone applications.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses includes cash and non-cash compensation, benefits, amortization of intangible assets and related costs in support of our general corporate functions, including general management, finance and accounting, human resources, selling and marketing, information technology and legal services.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $36.1 million, or 83.7%, to $79.3 million from $43.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated). This increase was primarily related to acquisition and debt restructuring charges in addition to increases in compensation and headcount.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $5.5 million (as restated), or 14.6% (as restated), to $43.2 million (as restated) from $37.7 million (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily related to an increase in performance and stock-based compensation during the year ended December 31, 2019, offset by a decrease in a certain legal accrual recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Contingent Consideration. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded on its consolidated balance sheet a liability of $8.9 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration issued in the acquisitions of Giner ELX and UHG. The fair value of this contingent consideration was remeasured as of December 31, 2020 and was estimated to be $10.2 million. This change in fair value of $1.2 million was recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 5, “Acquisitions,” to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Interest and other expense, net. Interest and other expense, net consists of interest and other expenses related to our long-term debt, convertible senior notes, obligations under finance leases and our finance obligations, as well as foreign currency exchange losses, offset by interest and other income consisting primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, foreign currency exchange gains and other income. The Company entered into a series of finance leases with Generate Capital during 2018. Approximately $50.0 million of these finance leases were terminated and replaced with long-term debt with Generate Capital in March 2019. Additionally, in September of 2019 and March of
2018, the Company issued convertible senior notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Since December 31, 2019, the Company assumed approximately $100 million of additional long-term debt at 9.50% interest, issued $212.5 million convertible senior notes at 3.75% interest, and entered into additional sale/leaseback finance obligation arrangements at an incremental borrowing rates ranging from 10.75% to 12.00%.
Net interest and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased $24.8 million or 69.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (as restated). This increase was attributable to an increase in interest expense associated with the Company’s increased finance obligations, long-term debt and the issuance of the convertible senior notes, as mentioned above.
Net interest and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased $12.9 million (as restated) or 56.9% (as restated), as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (as restated). This increase was attributed to the increase in finance leases and long-term debt during 2019 and the issuance of convertible senior notes in September 2019 and March 2018, as mentioned above.
Common Stock Warrant Liability
The Company accounts for certain common stock warrants, other than the Amazon Warrant and the warrant issued to Walmart, as common stock warrant liability with changes in the fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in the fair value of common stock warrant liability.
All remaining common stock warrants were fully exercised in the fourth quarter of 2019. As such, there was no change in fair value of common stock warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The change in fair value of common stock warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease in the associated warrant liability of $79 thousand as compared to a decrease of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These variances were primarily due to changes in the average remaining term of the warrants, an increase in Company’s common stock price, and changes in volatility of our common stock, which are significant inputs to the Black-Scholes valuation model used to calculate the fair value of these warrants at each financial reporting date. All of these warrants were exercised on October 15, 2019 for net proceeds of $14.1 million.
Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 14,615,615 shares in connection with the conversion of approximately $33.5 million of its 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes. The resulting gain of approximately $4.5 million is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In May 2020, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes to repurchase approximately $66.3 million of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes which resulted in a $13.2 million gain on early debt extinguishment.
In March 2019, the Company restructured its long-term debt with NY Green Bank, a Division of the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (“NY Green Bank”), which resulted in a loss on early debt extinguishment of $0.5 million.
Income Tax
The Company recognized an income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $30.8 million resulting from a source of future taxable income attributable to the net credit to additional paid-in capital of $25.6 million related to the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, offset by the partial extinguishment of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes and $5.2 million of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the recognition of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the acquisition of Giner ELX. This resulted in a corresponding reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company has not changed its overall conclusion with respect to the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which remain fully reserved.
The net deferred tax asset generated from the Company’s current period NOL has been offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the NOL carry forward will not be realized. The
Company recognizes interest and penalties on the Interest and other expense, net line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The Company recognized an income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $0 and $9.3 million (as restated), respectively. The 2018 income tax benefit resulted from a source of future taxable income attributable to the net credit to additional paid-in capital related to the issuance of the $100 million Convertible Senior Notes discussed in Note 15, “Convertible Senior Notes, as restated.” The Company has not changed its overall conclusion with respect to the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which remain fully reserved.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During 2020, the Company issued and sold 79.0 million shares in two separate, registered equity offerings, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. See Note 16, “Stockholders’ Equity.” In May 2020, the Company issued $212.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2025, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. See Note 15, “Convertible Senior Notes.”
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $321.9 million of restricted cash. In January and February 2021, the Company issued and sold in another registered equity offering an aggregate of 32,200,000 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $65.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. Furthermore in February 2021, the Company completed the previously announced sale of its common stock in connection with a strategic partnership with SK Holdings to accelerate the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in Asian markets. The Company sold 54,996,188 shares of its common stock to a subsidiary of SK Holdings at a purchase price of $29.2893 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion. See Note 23, “Subsequent Events.”
The Company has continued to experience negative cash flows from operations and net losses. The Company incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of $596.2 million, $85.6 million and $85.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively (2019 and 2018 as restated). The Company’s cash used in operations totaled $155.5 million, $53.3 million, and $58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and had an accumulated deficit of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020.
The Company’s significant obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020:
(i) Operating and finance leases totaling $113.9 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of which $14.3 million and $903 thousand, respectively, are due within the next 12 months. These leases are primarily related to sale/leaseback agreements entered into with various financial institutions to facilitate the Company’s commercial transactions with key customers.
(ii) Finance obligations totaling $181.6 million of which approximately $32.7 million are due within the next 12 months. Finance obligations consist primarily of debt associated with sale of future revenues and failed sale-leaseback financings.
(iii) Long-term debt, primarily related to the Company’s loan agreement with Generate Capital, totaling $175.4 million of which $25.4 million is classified as short term on the consolidated balance sheets.
(iv) Convertible senior notes totaling $85.6 million at December 31, 2020
The Company believes that its current working capital of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion, together with proceeds from the January 2021 registered equity offering and SK Group investment, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for a least one year after the date the financial statements are issued.
The Company plans to invest a portion of its available cash to expand its current production and manufacturing capacity and to fund strategic acquisitions and partnerships and capital projects. Future use of the Company’s funds is discretionary and the Company believes that its future working capital and cash position will be sufficient to fund operations even after these growth investments.

In addition, the Company used approximately $16.3 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes to enter into privately negotiated capped called transactions. In the fourth quarter of 2020, $33.5 million of the remaining 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes were converted into 14.6 million shares of common stock, resulting in a gain of approximately $4.5 million which was recorded on the consolidated statement of operations on the gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt line.

On July 1, 2020, the note automatically converted fully into 16.0 million shares of common stock.
Secured Debt
In March 2019, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement, as amended (the “Loan Agreement”), with Generate Lending, LLC (“Generate Capital”), providing for a secured term loan facility in the amount of $100 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). The Company used the proceeds to pay off in full the Company’s previous loan with NY Green Bank a Division of the New York State Energy Research & Development (“Green-Bank Loan”) and terminate and re-purchase certain equipment leases with Generate Plug Power SLB II, LLC. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This loss was recorded in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The Company borrowed an incremental $20 million in November 2019.
Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company, under another series of amendments to the Loan Agreement, borrowed an incremental $100 million. As part of the amendment to the Loan Agreement, the Company’s interest rate on the secured term loan facility was reduced to 9.50% from 12.00% per annum, and the maturity date was extended to October 31, 2025 from October 6, 2022. On December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance under the Term Loan Facility was $165.8 million.
The Loan Agreement includes covenants, limitations, and events of default customary for similar facilities. Interest and a portion of the principal amount is payable on a quarterly basis. Principal payments are funded in part by releases of restricted cash, as described in Note 22, “Commitments and Contingencies, as restated.” Based on the amortization schedule as of December 31, 2020, the loan balance under the Term Loan Facility will be fully paid by October 31, 2025.
The Term Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company’s and the guarantor subsidiaries’ assets, including, among other assets, all intellectual property, all securities in domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the securities in foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.
The Loan Agreement provides that if there is an event of default due to the Company’s insolvency or if the Company fails to perform in any material respect the servicing requirements for fuel cell systems under certain customer agreements, which failure would entitle the customer to terminate such customer agreement, replace the Company or withhold the payment of any material amount to the Company under such customer agreement, then Generate Capital has the right to cause Proton Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to replace the Company in performing the maintenance services under such customer agreement.
Additionally, $1.75 million was paid to an escrow account related to additional fees due in connection with the GreenBank Loan if the Company does not meet certain New York State employment and fuel cell deployment targets by March 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received $250 thousand from escrow related to the New York state employment targets. The Company received an additional $700 thousand in March 2021 for meeting the employment targets and this amount was recorded in short-term other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Company did not meet the deployment targets and charged-off the balance of $800 thousand to interest expense as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020 the Term Loan Facility requires the principal balance as of each of the following dates not to exceed the following (in thousands):
Several key indicators of liquidity are summarized in the following table (in thousands):
3.75% Convertible Senior Notes
On May 18, 2020, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. On May 29, 2020, the Company issued an additional $12.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes.
At issuance in May 2020, the total net proceeds from the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes were as follows:
The 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020. The notes will mature on June 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms.
The 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, including the Company’s $100 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “5.5% Convertible Senior Notes”), effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of its current or future subsidiaries.
Holders of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2024 in the following circumstances:
1) during any calendar quarter commencing after December 31, 2020, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
2) during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;
3) if the Company calls any or all of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes for redemption, any such notes that have been called for redemption may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture governing the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes.
On or after December 1, 2024, the holders of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions.
The initial conversion rate for the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes is 198.6196 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.03 per share of the Company’s common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. During January and February of 2021, $15.2 million of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes were converted and the Company has issued 3.0 million shares in conjunction with these conversions.
In addition, following certain corporate events or following issuance of a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its notes called for redemption during the related redemption period in certain circumstances.
The 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 5, 2023 and before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including at least one of the three trading days immediately preceding the date the Company sends the related redemption notice, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company sends such redemption notice.
If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase their notes for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
In accounting for the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company separated the notes into liability and equity components. The initial carrying amount of the liability component of approximately $75.2 million, net of costs incurred, was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component of approximately $130.3 million, net of costs incurred, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes. The difference between the principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and the liability component (the debt discount) is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes. The effective interest rate is approximately 29.0%. The equity component of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes is included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.
We incurred transaction costs related to the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes of approximately $7.0 million, consisting of initial purchasers’ discount of approximately $6.4 million and other issuance costs of $0.6 million. In accounting for the transaction costs, we allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were approximately $2.6 million, were recorded as debt issuance cost (presented as contra debt in the consolidated balance sheets) and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes. The transaction costs attributable to the equity component were approximately $4.4 million and were netted with the equity component in stockholders’ equity.
The 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):
1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, net and amortized over the remaining life of the notes using the effective interest rate method.
2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of the associated income tax benefit of $29.8 million.
Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $33.91 on December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the notes was greater than the principal amount. The estimated fair value of the note at December 31, 2020 was approximately $1.3 billion. Fair value estimation was primarily based on a stock exchange, active trade on December 29, 2020 of the 3.75% Senior Convertible Note. The Company considers this a Level 1 fair value measurement. Refer to Note 4, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Capped Call
In conjunction with the pricing of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “3.75% Notes Capped Call”) with certain counterparties at a price of $16.3 million. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call covers, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that underlie the initial 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and is generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call is initially $6.7560 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 60% over the last then-reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $4.11 per share on the date of the transaction and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call becomes exercisable if the conversion option is exercised.
The net cost incurred in connection with the 3.75% Notes Capped Call has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.
7.5% Convertible Senior Note
In September 2019, the Company issued $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Convertible Senior Note, in exchange for net proceeds of $39.1 million, in a private placement to an accredited investor pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. There were no required principal payments prior to the maturity of the 7.5% Convertible Senior Note. Upon maturity of the 7.5% Convertible Senior Note, the Company was required to repay 120% of $40.0 million, or $48.0 million. The 7.5% Convertible Senior Note bore interest at 7.5% per year, payable quarterly in arrears on January 5, April 5, July 5 and October 5 of each year beginning on October 5, 2019 and was to mature on January 5, 2023 unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with its terms. The 7.5% Convertible Senior Note was unsecured and did not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, or the issuance or repurchase of common stock by the Company.
On July 1, 2020, the 7.5% Convertible Senior Note automatically converted into 16.0 million shares of common stock.
5.5% Convertible Senior Notes
In March 2018, the Company issued $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due on March 15, 2023 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
In May 2020, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes to finance the cash portion of the partial repurchase of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes, which consisted of a repurchase of approximately $66.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes in privately-negotiated transactions for aggregate consideration of $128.9 million, consisting of approximately $90.2 million in cash and approximately 9.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Of the $128.9 million in aggregate consideration, $35.5 million and $93.4 million were allocated to the debt and equity components, respectively, utilizing an effective discount rate of 29.8% to determine the fair value of the liability component. As of the repurchase date, the carrying value of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes that were repurchased, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, was $48.7 million. The partial repurchase of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes resulted in a $13.2 million gain on early debt extinguishment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, $33.5 million of the remaining 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes converted into 14.6 million shares of common stock which resulted in a gain of approximately $4.5 million which was recorded on the consolidated statement of operations on the gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt line. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $160 thousand aggregate principal amount of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes remained outstanding, all of which were converted to common stock in January 2021.
Capped Call
In conjunction with the pricing of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into the 5.5% Notes Capped Call with certain counterparties at a price of $16.0 million to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes, as the case may be. The net cost incurred in connection with the 5.5% Notes Capped Call has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets.
In conjunction with the partial repurchase of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company terminated 100% of the 5.5% Notes Capped Call on June 5, 2020. As a result of the termination, the Company received $24.2 million which was recorded in additional paid-in capital.
Common Stock Forward
In connection with the issuance of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company also entered into a forward stock purchase transaction, or the Common Stock Forward, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 14,397,906 shares of its common stock for settlement on or about March 15, 2023. In connection with the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and the partial payoff of the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company amended and extended the maturity of the Common Stock Forward to June 1, 2025. The number of shares of common stock that the Company will ultimately repurchase under the Common Stock Forward is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Common Stock Forward is subject to early settlement or settlement with alternative consideration in the event of certain corporate transactions.
The net cost incurred in connection with the Common Stock Forward of $27.5 million has been recorded as an increase in treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheets during 2018. The related shares were accounted for as a repurchase of common stock.
The book value of the Common Stock Forward is not remeasured.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Common Stock Forward was partially settled and, as a result, the Company received 4.4 million shares of its common stock.
Amazon Transaction Agreement
On April 4, 2017, the Company and Amazon entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “Amazon Transaction Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Amazon, a warrant (the “Amazon Warrant”) to acquire up to 55,286,696 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Amazon Warrant Shares”), subject to certain vesting events described below. The Company and Amazon entered into the Amazon Transaction Agreement in connection with existing commercial agreements between the Company and Amazon with respect to the deployment of the Company’s GenKey fuel cell technology at Amazon distribution centers. The existing commercial agreements contemplate, but do not guarantee, future purchase orders for the Company’s fuel cell technology. The vesting of the Amazon Warrant Shares was conditioned upon payments made by Amazon or its affiliates (directly or indirectly through third parties) pursuant to the existing commercial agreements.
Under the terms of the original Amazon Warrant, the first tranche of 5,819,652 of the Amazon Warrant Shares vested upon execution, and the remaining Amazon Warrant Shares vest based on Amazon’s payment of up to $600.0 million to the Company in connection with Amazon’s purchase of goods and services from the Company. The $6.7 million fair value of the first tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares, was recognized as selling, general and administrative expense upon execution of the Amazon Warrant during 2017.
Provision for the second and third tranches of Amazon Warrant Shares is recorded as a reduction of revenue, because they represent consideration payable to a customer.
The fair value of the second tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares was measured at January 1, 2019, upon adoption of ASU 2019-08. The second tranche of 29,098,260 Amazon Warrant Shares cliff-vested in four equal installments, as Amazon or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, made an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling $200.0 million in the aggregate. The last installment of the second tranche vested on November 2, 2020. Revenue reductions of $9.0 million, $4.1 million and $9.8 million associated with the second tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares were recorded in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, under the terms of the original Amazon Warrant.
Under the terms of the original Amazon Warrant, the third tranche of 20,368,784 Amazon Warrant Shares vests in eight equal installments, as Amazon or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, make an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling $400.0 million in the aggregate. The measurement date for the third tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares was November 2, 2020, when their exercise price was determined, as discussed further below. The fair value of the third tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares on that date was determined to be $10.57 each. During 2020, revenue reductions of $24.1 million associated with the third tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares were recorded under the terms of the original Amazon Warrant, prior to the December 31, 2020 waiver described below.
On December 31, 2020, the Company waived the remaining vesting conditions under the Amazon Warrant, which resulted in the immediate vesting of the 20,368,784 unvested third tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares and recognition of an additional $399.7 million reduction to revenue.
The $399.7 million reduction to revenue resulting from the December 31, 2020 waiver was determined based upon a probability assessment of whether the underlying shares would have vested under the terms of the original Amazon Warrant. Based upon the Company’s projections of probable future cash collections from Amazon (i.e., a Type I share based payment modification), a reduction of revenue associated with 5,354,905 Amazon Warrant Shares was recognized at their previously measured November 2, 2020 fair value of $10.57 per warrant. A reduction of revenue associated with the remaining 12,730,490 Amazon Warrant Shares was recognized at their December 31, 2020 fair value of $26.95 each, based upon the Company’s assessment that associated future cash collections from Amazon were not deemed probable (i.e., a Type III share based payment modification).
The $399.7 million reduction to revenue was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 because the Company concluded such amount was not recoverable from the margins expected from probable future revenues attributable to Amazon, and no exclusivity or other rights were conferred to the Company in connection with the December 31, 2020 waiver.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 55,286,696 and 20,368,782 of the Amazon Warrant Shares had vested, respectively. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the Amazon Warrant during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 and 2018 was $420.0 million, $4.1 million, and $9.8 million, respectively.
The exercise price for the first and second tranches of Amazon Warrant Shares is $1.1893 per share. The exercise price of the third tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares is $13.81 per share, which was determined pursuant to the terms of the Amazon Warrant as an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the 30-day volume weighted average share price of the Company’s common stock as of November 2, 2020, the final vesting date of the second tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares. The Amazon Warrant is exercisable through April 4, 2027. The Amazon Warrant provides for net share settlement that, if elected by the holder, will reduce the number of shares issued upon exercise to reflect net settlement of the exercise price. The Amazon Warrant provides for certain adjustments that may be made to the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise due to customary anti-dilution provisions based on future events. The Amazon Warrant is classified as an equity instrument.
Walmart Transaction Agreement
On July 20, 2017, the Company and Walmart entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “Walmart Transaction Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Walmart a warrant (the “Walmart Warrant”) to acquire up to 55,286,696 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events (the “Walmart Warrant Shares”). The Company and Walmart entered into the Walmart Transaction Agreement in connection with existing commercial agreements between the Company and Walmart with respect to the deployment of the Company’s GenKey fuel cell technology across various Walmart distribution centers. The existing commercial agreements contemplate, but do not guarantee, future purchase orders for the Company’s fuel cell technology. The vesting of the Walmart Warrant Shares is conditioned upon payments made by Walmart or its affiliates (directly or indirectly through third parties) pursuant to transactions entered into after January 1, 2017 under existing commercial agreements.
The majority of the Walmart Warrant Shares will vest based on Walmart’s payment of up to $600.0 million to the Company in connection with Walmart’s purchase of goods and services from the Company. The first tranche of 5,819,652 Walmart Warrant Shares vested upon the execution of the Walmart Transaction Agreement and was fully exercised as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, $10.9 million, the fair value of the first tranche of Walmart Warrant Shares, was recorded as a provision for common stock warrants and presented as a reduction to revenue on the consolidated statements of operations during 2017. All future provision for common stock warrants is measured based on their grant-date fair value and recorded as a charge against revenue. The second tranche of 29,098,260 Walmart Warrant Shares vests in four installments of 7,274,565 Walmart Warrant Shares each time Walmart or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, make an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling $200.0 million in the aggregate. The exercise price for the first and second tranches of Walmart Warrant Shares is $2.1231 per share. After Walmart has made payments to the Company totaling $200.0 million, the third tranche of 20,368,784 Walmart Warrant Shares will vest in eight installments of 2,546,098 Walmart Warrant Shares each time Walmart or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, make an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling $400.0 million in the aggregate. The exercise price of the third tranche of Walmart Warrant Shares will be an amount per share equal to ninety percent (90%) of the 30-day volume weighted average share price of the common stock as of the final vesting date of the second tranche of Walmart Warrant Shares, provided that, with limited exceptions, the exercise price for the third tranche will be no lower than $1.1893. The Walmart Warrant is exercisable through July 20, 2027.
The Walmart Warrant provides for net share settlement that, if elected by the holder, will reduce the number of shares issued upon exercise to reflect net settlement of the exercise price. The Walmart Warrant provides for certain adjustments that may be made to the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise due to customary anti-dilution provisions based on future events. The Walmart Warrant is classified as an equity instrument.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 13,094,217 and 5,819,652 of the Walmart Warrant Shares had vested, respectively. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the Walmart Warrant during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $5.0 million, $2.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
Lessee Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had operating leases, as lessee, primarily associated with sale/leaseback transactions that are partially secured by restricted cash, security deposits and pledged escrows (see also Note 1, “Nature of Operations”) as summarized below. These leases expire over the next one to nine years. Minimum rent payments under operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Leases contain termination clauses with associated penalties, the amount of which cause the likelihood of cancellation to be remote. At the end of the lease term, the leased assets may be returned to the lessor by the Company, the Company may negotiate with the lessor to purchase the assets at fair market value, or the Company may negotiate with the lessor to renew the lease at market rental rates. No residual value guarantees are contained in the leases. No financial covenants are contained within the lease, however there are customary operational covenants such as assurance the Company properly maintains the leased assets and carries appropriate insurance, etc. The leases include credit support in the form of either cash, collateral or letters of credit. See Note 22, “Commitments and Contingencies, as restated,” for a description of cash held as security associated with the leases.
The Company has finance leases associated with its property and equipment in Latham, New York and at fueling customer locations. The fair value of this finance obligation approximated the carrying value as of December 31, 2020.
Future minimum lease payments under operating and finance leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):
Rental expense for all operating leases was $22.3 million, $14.6 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The gross profit on sale/leaseback transactions for all operating leases was $61.0 million, $26.2 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Right of use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities was $58.5 million and $37.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the right of use assets associated with operating leases was $117.0 million and $63.3 million, respectively. The accumulated depreciation for these right of use assets was $48.6 million and $23.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the right of use assets associated with finance leases was $5.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The accumulated depreciation for these right of use assets was $102 thousand and $32 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, security deposits associated with sale/leaseback transactions were $5.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively, and were included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
Other information related to the operating leases are presented in the following table:
Finance lease costs include amortization of the right of use assets (i.e., depreciation expense) and interest on lease liabilities (i.e., interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations), and were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Right of use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities were $4.1 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Other information related to the finance leases are presented in the following table:
The Company has sold future services to be performed associated with certain sale/leaseback transactions and recorded the balance as a finance obligation. The outstanding balance of this obligation at December 31, 2020 was $157.7 million, $24.2 million and $133.5 million of which was classified as short-term and long-term, respectively, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The outstanding balance of this obligation at December 31, 2019 was $112.4 million, $16.8 million and $95.6 million (as restated) of which was classified as short-term and long-term, respectively. The amount is amortized using the effective interest method. The fair value of this finance obligation approximated the carrying value as of December 31, 2020.
In prior periods, the Company entered into sale/leaseback transactions that were accounted for as financing transactions and reported as part of finance obligations. The outstanding balance of finance obligations related to sale/leaseback transactions at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $23.9 million and $31.7 million (as restated), respectively. The fair value of this finance obligation approximated the carrying value as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Future minimum payments under finance obligations noted above as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):
Other information related to the above finance obligations are presented in the following table:
The Company has outstanding obligations to Wells Fargo under several Master Lease Agreements totaling $93.2 million at December 31, 2020. These outstanding obligations are included in operating lease liabilities, finance lease liabilities, and finance obligations.
Restricted Cash
In connection with certain of the above noted sale/leaseback agreements, cash of $170.4 million was required to be restricted as a security deposit as of December 31, 2020, which restricted cash will be released over the lease term. As of December 31, 2020, the Company also had certain letters of credit backed by security deposits totaling $152.4 million that are security for the above noted sale/leaseback agreements, for which the requirements wind down over the lease terms and commensurately the restricted cash will be released.
The Company also had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $0.5 million at December 31, 2020 associated with a finance lease of its building. We consider cash collateralizing this letter of credit as restricted cash.
Contractual Obligations
Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, under agreements with non-cancelable terms are as follows (in thousands):
(A) The Company has several non-cancelable operating leases that generally have six to seven year terms, primarily associated with sale/leaseback transactions and are partially secured with restricted cash, security deposits and pledged escrows. In addition, the Company provides its products and services to certain customers in the form of a PPA that generally have six to seven year terms. The Company accounts for these non-cancelable sale/leaseback transactions as operating leases in accordance with (ASC) Subtopic 842, Leases, which was adopted in 2018. The liability for operating leases recognized is presented separately on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12, “Operating and Finance Leases” to the consolidated financial statements for more detail.
(B) During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2017 and 2016, the Company entered into a series of project financings, which are accounted for as finance leases and reported as part of the finance obligations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. These obligations are secured with restricted cash, security deposits and pledged escrows. The Company also has a finance obligation related to a sale/leaseback transaction involving its building.
(C) The Company has received cash for future services to be performed associated with certain sale/leaseback transactions, which are treated as a finance obligation.
(D) The Company has purchase obligations related to inventory build to meet its sales plan, stack and stack components for new units and servicing existing units.
(E) The Company has entered into a long-term debt agreement with Generate Capital. We expect to make principal and interest payments using the proceeds from the release of restricted cash.
(F) The Company issued Convertible Senior Notes in March of 2018 and May of 2020. See “7.5% Convertible Senior Note” and “5.5% Convertible Senior Notes” above for details.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future significant effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of and during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, valuation of long-lived assets, accrual for loss contracts on service, operating and finance leases, product warranty reserves, unbilled revenue, common stock warrants, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and contingencies. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about (1) the carrying values of assets and liabilities and (2) the amount of revenue and expenses realized that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following are our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions the Company must make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.
Revenue Recognition
The Company enters into contracts that may contain one or a combination of fuel cell systems and infrastructure, installation, maintenance, spare parts, fuel delivery and other support services. Contracts containing fuel cell systems and related infrastructure may be sold directly to customers or provided to customers under a PPA, discussed further below.
The Company does not include a right of return on its products other than rights related to standard warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated standard warranty costs at the same time that revenue is recognized for the related product, or when circumstances indicate that warranty costs will be incurred, as applicable. Any prepaid amounts would only be refunded to the extent services have not been provided or the fuel cell systems or infrastructure have not been delivered.
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price specified in a contract with a customer, subject to the allocation of the transaction price to distinct performance obligations as discussed below. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a product or service to a customer.
Promises to the customer are separated into performance obligations, and are accounted for separately if they are (1) capable of being distinct and (2) distinct in the context of the contract. The Company considers a performance obligation to be distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and the Company’s promise to transfer the goods or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
Payment terms for sales of fuel cells, infrastructure and service to customers are typically 30 to 90 days. Sale/leaseback transactions with financial institutions are invoiced and collected upon transaction closing. Service is prepaid upfront in a majority of the arrangements. The Company does not adjust the transaction price for a significant financing component when the performance obligation is expected to be fulfilled within a year.
In 2017, in separate transactions, the Company issued to each of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC and Walmart warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company presents the provision for common stock warrants within each revenue-related line item on the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation reflects a discount that those common stock warrants represent, and therefore revenue is net of these non-cash charges.
The provision of common stock warrants is allocated to the relevant revenue-related line items based upon the expected mix of the revenue for each respective contract. See Note 18, “Warrant Transaction Agreements,” for more details.
Nature of goods and services
The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue.
(i) Sales of Fuel Cell Systems and Related Infrastructure
Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure.
The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for fuel cells systems and related infrastructure. For GenDrive fuel cells, given the nascent nature of the Company’s market, the Company considers several inputs, including prices from a limited number of standalone sales as well as the Company’s negotiations with customers. The Company also considers its costs to produce fuel cells as well as comparable list prices in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company uses applicable observable evidence from similar products in the market to determine standalone selling prices for GenSure stationary backup power units and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company’s performance obligations requires significant judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Once relative standalone selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation within the customer arrangement based upon standalone selling price. The allocated transaction price related to fuel cell systems and spare parts is recognized as revenue at a point in time which usually occurs at shipment (and occasionally upon delivery). Revenue on hydrogen infrastructure installations is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon customer acceptance of the hydrogen infrastructure. In certain instances, control of hydrogen infrastructure installations transfers to the customer over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company uses an input method to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period when such revenue is recognized over time, based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.
(ii)Services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure
Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine standalone selling prices for services. This approach considers market conditions and constraints, the Company’s market share, pricing strategies and objectives while maximizing the use of available observable inputs obtained from a limited number of historical standalone service renewal prices and negotiations with customers. The transaction price allocated to services as discussed above is generally recognized as revenue over time on a straight-line basis over the expected service period, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of routine, recurring maintenance performed throughout the contract period.
In substantially all of its commercial transactions, the Company sells extended maintenance contracts that generally provide for a five-to-ten-year service period from the date of product installation in exchange for an up-front payment. Services include monitoring, technical support, maintenance and services that provide for 97% to 98% uptime of the fleet. These services are accounted for as a separate performance obligation, and accordingly, revenue generated from these transactions, subject to the proportional allocation of transaction price, is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract, generally on a straight-line basis. Additionally, the Company may enter into annual service and extended maintenance contracts that are billed monthly. Revenue generated from these transactions is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Costs are recognized as incurred over the term of the contract. When costs are projected to exceed revenues over the life of the extended maintenance contract, an accrual for loss contracts is recorded. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a loss accrual of $24.0 million and $3.7 million respectively (2019 restated). Costs are estimated based upon historical experience and consider the estimated impact of the Company’s cost reduction initiatives. The actual results may differ from these estimates. See “Extended Maintenance Contracts” below.
Extended maintenance contracts generally do not contain customer renewal options. Upon expiration, customers may either negotiate a contract extension or switch to purchasing spare parts and maintaining the fuel cell systems on their own.
(iii)Power Purchase Agreements
Revenue from PPAs primarily represents payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access for the Company’s GenKey solution.
Revenue associated with these agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreements as the customers receive the benefits from the Company’s performance of the services. The customers receive services ratably over the contract term.
In conjunction with entering into a PPA with a customer, the Company may enter into transactions with third-party financial institutions in which it receives proceeds from the sale/leaseback transactions of the equipment and the sale of future service revenue. The proceeds from the financial institution are allocated between the sale of equipment and the sale of future service revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices of equipment and service. The proceeds allocated to the sale of future services are recognized as finance obligations. The proceeds allocated to the sale of the equipment are evaluated to determine if the transaction meets the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting. To meet the sale/leaseback criteria, control of the equipment must transfer to the financial institution, which requires among other criteria the leaseback to meet the criteria for an operating lease and the Company must not have a right to repurchase the equipment (unless specific criteria are met). These transactions typically meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on the sale of the equipment, and separately recognizes the leaseback obligations.
The Company recognizes a lease liability for the equipment leaseback obligation based on the present value of the future payments to the financial institutions that are attributed to the equipment leaseback. The discount rate used to determine the lease liability is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which is based on an analysis of the interest rates on the Company’s secured borrowings. Adjustments that considered the Company’s actual borrowing rate, inclusive of securitization, as well as borrowing rates for companies of similar credit quality, were applied in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate. The Company also records a right of use asset which is amortized over the term of the leaseback. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the leaseback and is included as a cost of PPA revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
Certain of the Company’s transactions with financial institutions do not meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, no equipment sale is recognized. All proceeds from these transactions are accounted for as finance obligations. The right of use assets related to these transactions are classified as equipment related to the PPAs and fuel delivered to the customers, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Costs to service the property, depreciation of the assets related to PPAs and fuel delivered to the customers, and other related costs are included in cost of PPA revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses its transaction-date incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate for its finance obligations that arise from these transactions. No additional adjustments to the incremental borrowing rate have been deemed necessary for the finance obligations that have resulted from the failed sale/leaseback transactions.
In determining whether the sales of fuel cells and other equipment to financial institutions meet the requirements for revenue recognition under sale/leaseback accounting, the Company, as lessee, determines the classification of the lease. The Company estimates certain key inputs to the associated calculations such as: 1) discount rate used to determine the present value of future lease payments, 2) fair value of the fuel cells and equipment, and 3) useful life of the underlying asset(s):
● ASC Topic 842 requires a lessee to discount its future lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company cannot determine the interest rate implicit in its leases because it does not have access to the lessor’s estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor’s deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate to estimate the discount rate for each lease. Adjustments that considered the Company’s actual borrowing rate, inclusive of securitization, as well as borrowing rates for companies of similar credit quality were applied in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate.
● In order for the lease to be classified as an operating lease, the present value of the future lease payments cannot exceed 90% of the fair value of the leased assets. The Company estimates the fair value of the lease assets using the sales prices.
● In order for a lease to be classified as an operating lease, the lease term cannot exceed 75% (major part) of the estimated useful life of the leased asset. The average estimated useful life of the fuel cells is 10 years, and the average estimated useful life of the hydrogen infrastructure is 20 years. These estimated useful lives are compared to the term of each lease to determine the appropriate lease classification.
(iv)Fuel Delivered to Customers
Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated on site. The stand-alone selling price is not estimated because it is sold separately and therefore directly observable.
The Company purchases hydrogen fuel from suppliers in most cases (and sometimes produces hydrogen onsite) and sells to its customers. Revenue and cost of revenue related to this fuel is recorded as dispensed and is included in the respective “Fuel delivered to customers” lines on the consolidated statements of operations.
Contract costs
The Company expects that incremental commission fees paid to employees as a result of obtaining sales contracts are recoverable and therefore the Company capitalizes them as contract costs.
Capitalized commission fees are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time which the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate occur, typically ranging from 5 to 10 years. Amortization of the capitalized commission fees is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and PPA Executory Contract Considerations
We evaluate long-lived assets on a quarterly basis to identify events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) that indicate the carrying value of certain assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets that we evaluate include right of use lease assets, equipment deployed to our PPAs, assets related primarily to our fuel delivery business and other company owned long-lived assets.
Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, long-lived assets are evaluated to determine if the carrying amounts are recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups. For operating assets, the Company has generally determined that the lowest level of identifiable cash flows is based on the customer sites. The assets related primarily to our fuel delivery business are considered to be their own asset group. The cash flows are estimated based on the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group.
For assets related to our PPA agreements, we consider all underlying cash inflows related to our contract revenues and cash outflows relating to the costs incurred to service the PPAs. Our cash flow estimates used in the recoverability test, are based upon, among other things, historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future cash flows and operating performance. Development of future cash flows also requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including timing of future expected cash flows, future cost savings initiatives, and determining recovery values. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect the outcome of our recoverability tests and cause more asset groups to be tested for impairment.
If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for a given asset group are less than the carrying amount of the related asset group, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset group. The impairment loss is then allocated to the long-lived assets in the asset group based on the asset’s
relative carrying amounts. However, assets are not impaired below their then estimated fair values. Fair value is generally determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as well as year-over-year trends in pricing of our new equipment and overall evaluation of our industry and market, as considered necessary. The Company considers these indicators with certain of its own internal indices and metrics in determining fair value in light of the nascent state of the Company’s market and industry. The estimate of fair value represents our best estimates of these factors and is subject to variability. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect our impairment evaluation.
The Company has determined that the assets deployed for certain PPA arrangements are not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset group. However, the estimated fair value of the assets in the asset group equal or exceed the carrying amount of the assets or otherwise limit the amount of impairment that would have been recognized. The Company has identified the primary source of the losses as the maintenance components of the PPA arrangements and the impact of customer warrant non-cash provisions. As the PPA arrangements are considered to be executory contracts and there is no specific accounting guidance that permits loss recognition for these revenue contracts, the Company has not recognized a provision for the expected future losses under these revenue arrangements. The Company expects that it will recognize future losses for these arrangements as it continues its efforts to reduce costs of delivering the maintenance component of these arrangements. The Company has estimated total future revenues and costs for these types of arrangements based on existing contracts and leverage of the related assets. For the future estimates, the Company used service cost estimates for extended maintenance contracts and customer warrant provisions at rates consistent with experience to date. The terms for the underlying estimates vary but the average residual term on the existing contracts is 5 years. Based on the future estimates with these assumptions, the losses could approximate $120 million. This estimate includes $75 million in non-cash charges for depreciation and provision for customer warrants. Actual results could be significantly different than these estimates.
Extended Maintenance Contracts
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate any potential losses related to our extended maintenance contracts for fuel cell systems and related infrastructure that has been sold. We measure impairment losses at the customer contract level. The expected revenues and expenses for these contracts include all applicable expected costs of providing services over the remaining term of the contracts and the related unearned net revenue. A loss is recognized if the sum of expected costs of providing services under the contract exceeds related unearned net revenue and is recorded as a provision for loss contracts related to service in the consolidated statement of operations. A key component of these estimates is the expected future service costs. In estimating the expected future costs, the Company considers its current service cost level and applies significant judgment related to expected cost saving initiatives. The expected future cost savings will be primarily dependent upon the success of the Company’s initiatives related to increasing stack life, achieving better economies of scale for service labor, and improvements in design and operations of infrastructure. If the expected cost saving initiatives are not realized, this will increase the costs of providing services and could adversely affect our estimated contract loss accrual. If actual service costs over the remaining term of existing extended maintenance contracts are 10% more than estimated in the determination of the loss accrual for fuel cell systems and related infrastructure at December 31, 2020, the loss accrual would have been approximately $7.1 million higher.
The following table shows the rollforward of balance in the accrual for loss contracts, including changes due to the passage of time, additions and changes in estimates (in thousands):
Equity Instruments
Common stock warrants that meet certain applicable requirements of ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and other related guidance, including the ability of the Company to settle the warrants without the issuance of registered shares or the absence of rights of the grantee to require cash settlement, are
accounted for as equity instruments. The Company classifies these equity instruments within additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
Common stock warrants accounted for as equity instruments represent the warrants issued to Amazon and Walmart as discussed in Note 18, “Warrant Transaction Agreements.” The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update 2019-08, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2019-08), which requires entities to measure and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer by applying the guidance under Topic 718, as of January 1, 2019.
In order to calculate warrant charges, the Company used the Black-Scholes pricing model, which required key inputs including volatility and risk-free interest rate and certain unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company estimated the fair value of unvested warrants, considered to be probable of vesting, at the time. Based on that estimated fair value, the Company determined warrant charges, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, was issued. Also, in April 2019, Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, was issued to make improvements to updates 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10), 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) and 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). ASU 2016-13 significantly changes how entities account for credit losses for financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade receivables and contract assets, that are not measured at fair value through net income. The ASU requires a number of changes to the assessment of credit losses, including the utilization of an expected credit loss model, which requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the entire lifetime of the asset, including losses where probability is considered remote. Additionally, the standard requires the estimation of lifetime expected losses for trade receivables and contract assets that are classified as current. The Company adopted these standards effective January 1, 2020 and determined the impact of the standards to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), was issued to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020 and determined there to be no impact to the consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued and Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). This ASU simplifies the complexity associated with applying GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible instruments and derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument, such as the Company’s 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if-converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments and requires additional disclosures. This guidance is required to be adopted by January 1, 2022, and early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company has elected to early adopt this guidance on January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective method. Under this transition method, the cumulative effect of accounting change removed the impact of recognizing the equity component of the Company’s convertible notes at issuance and the subsequent accounting impact of additional interest expense from debt discount amortization. The cumulative effect of the accounting change
upon adoption on January 1, 2021 increased the carrying amount of the convertible notes by $120.7 million, reduced accumulated deficit by $9.5 million and reduced additional paid-in capital by $130.2 million. Future interest expense of the convertible notes will be lower as a result of adoption of this guidance and net loss per share will be computed using the if-converted method for convertible instruments.
In March 2020, ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, was issued to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This update was effective starting March 12, 2020 and the Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, ASU 2020-03, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments, was issued to make various codification improvements to financial instruments to make the standards easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. This update will be effective at various dates beginning with date of issuance of this ASU. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, was issued to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. This update will be effective beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
