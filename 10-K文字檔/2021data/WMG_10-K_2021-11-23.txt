INTRODUCTION
The Company is the direct parent of Holdings, which is the direct parent of Acquisition Corp. Acquisition Corp. is one of the world’s major music entertainment companies.
The Company and Holdings are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their business operations through their subsidiaries. The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “ours” and the “Company” refer collectively to Warner Music Group Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where otherwise indicated.
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations.

•Critical accounting policies and estimates. This section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. The Company’s significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Use of OIBDA
We evaluate our operating performance based on several factors, including our primary financial measure of operating income (loss) before non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of intangible assets (“OIBDA”). We consider OIBDA to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Accordingly, OIBDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Warner Music Group Corp. and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). In addition, our definition of OIBDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of consolidated OIBDA to operating income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to Warner Music Group Corp. is provided in “-Results of Operations.”
Use of Constant Currency
As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons, we believe the presentation of revenue on a constant-currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant-currency information compares revenue between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We use revenue on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by calculating prior-year revenue using current-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as “excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.” This revenue should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, revenue reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Revenue on a constant-currency basis, as we present it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We are one of the world’s leading music entertainment companies. Our renowned family of iconic record labels, including Atlantic Records, Warner Records, Elektra Records and Parlophone Records, is home to many of the world’s most popular and influential recording artists. In addition, Warner Chappell Music, our global music publishing business, boasts an extraordinary catalog that includes timeless standards and contemporary hits, representing works by over 100,000 songwriters and composers, with a global collection of more than one million musical compositions. We classify our business interests into two fundamental operations: Recorded Music and Music Publishing. A brief description of each of those operations is presented below.
Components of Our Operating Results
Recorded Music Operations
Our Recorded Music business primarily consists of the discovery and development of recording artists and the related marketing, promotion, distribution, sale and licensing of music created by such recording artists. We play an integral role in virtually all aspects of the recorded music value chain from discovering and developing talent to producing, distributing and selling music to marketing and promoting recording artists and their music.
In the United States, our Recorded Music business is conducted principally through our major record labels-Atlantic Records and Warner Records. In October 2018, we launched Elektra Music Group in the United States as a standalone label group, which comprises the Elektra, Fueled by Ramen and Roadrunner labels. Our Recorded Music business also includes Rhino Entertainment, a division that specializes in marketing our recorded music catalog through compilations, reissuances of previously released music and video titles and releasing previously unreleased material from our vault. We also conduct our Recorded Music business through a collection of additional record labels including Asylum, Big Beat, Canvasback, East West, Erato, FFRR, Nonesuch, Parlophone, Reprise, Sire, Spinnin’ Records, Warner Classics and Warner Music Nashville.
Outside the United States, our Recorded Music business is conducted in more than 70 countries through various subsidiaries, affiliates and non-affiliated licensees. Internationally, we engage in the same activities as in the United States: discovering and signing artists and distributing, selling, marketing and promoting their music. In most cases, we also market, promote, distribute and sell the music of those recording artists for whom our domestic record labels have international rights. In certain smaller markets, we license the right to distribute and sell our music to non-affiliated third-party record labels.
Our Recorded Music business’ distribution operations include WEA Corp., which markets, distributes and sells music and video products to retailers and wholesale distributors; ADA, which markets, distributes and sells the products of independent labels to retail and wholesale distributors; and various distribution centers and ventures operated internationally.
In addition to our music being sold in physical retail outlets, our music is also sold in physical form to online physical retailers, such as amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com and bestbuy.com, and distributed in digital form to an expanded universe of digital partners, including streaming services such as those of Amazon, Apple, Deezer, SoundCloud, Spotify, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and YouTube, radio services such as iHeart Radio and SiriusXM and download services.
We have integrated the marketing of digital content into all aspects of our business, including A&R and distribution. Our business development executives work closely with A&R departments to ensure that while music is being produced, digital assets are also created with all distribution channels in mind, including streaming services, social networking sites, online portals and music-centered destinations. We also work side-by-side with our online and mobile partners to test new concepts. We believe existing and new digital businesses will be a significant source of growth and will provide new opportunities to successfully monetize our assets and create new revenue streams. The proportion of digital revenues attributable to each distribution channel varies by region and proportions may change as the introduction of new technologies continues. As one of the world’s largest music entertainment
companies, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in digital distribution and emerging technologies to maximize the value of our assets.
We have diversified our revenues beyond our traditional businesses by entering into expanded-rights deals with recording artists in order to partner with such artists in other aspects of their careers. Under these agreements, we provide services to and participate in recording artists’ activities outside the traditional recorded music business such as touring, merchandising and sponsorships. We have built and acquired artist services capabilities and platforms for marketing and distributing this broader set of music-related rights and participating more widely in the monetization of the artist brands we help create. We believe that entering into expanded-rights deals and enhancing our artist services capabilities in areas such as merchandising, VIP ticketing, fan clubs, concert promotion and management has permitted us to diversify revenue streams and capitalize on other revenue opportunities. This provides for improved long-term relationships with our recording artists and allows us to more effectively connect recording artists and fans.
Recorded Music revenues are derived from four main sources:
•Digital: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to streaming and download services;
•Physical: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to sales of physical products such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs;
•Artist services and expanded rights: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to our artist services businesses and our participation in expanded rights, including advertising, merchandising including direct-to-consumer sales, touring, concert promotion, ticketing, sponsorship, fan clubs, artist websites, social publishing, and artist and brand management; and
•Licensing: the rightsholder receives royalties or fees for the right to use sound recordings in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games; the rightsholder also receives royalties if sound recordings are performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable, and in public spaces such as shops, workplaces, restaurants, bars and clubs.
The principal costs associated with our Recorded Music business are as follows:
•A&R costs: the costs associated with (i) paying royalties to recording artists, producers, songwriters, other copyright holders and trade unions; (ii) signing and developing recording artists; and (iii) creating master recordings in the studio;
•Product costs: the costs to manufacture, package and distribute products to wholesale and retail distribution outlets, the royalty costs associated with distributing products of independent labels to wholesale and retail distribution outlets, as well as the costs related to our artist services business;
•Selling and marketing expenses: the costs associated with the promotion and marketing of recording artists and music, including costs to produce music videos for promotional purposes and artist tour support; and
•General and administrative expenses: the costs associated with general overhead and other administrative expenses.
Music Publishing Operations
While Recorded Music is focused on marketing, promoting, distributing and licensing a particular recording of a musical composition, Music Publishing is an intellectual property business focused on generating revenue from uses of the musical composition itself. In return for promoting, placing, marketing and administering the creative output of a songwriter, or engaging in those activities for other rightsholders, our Music Publishing business shares the revenues generated from use of the musical compositions with the songwriter or other rightsholders.
The operations of our Music Publishing business are conducted principally through Warner Chappell Music, our global music publishing company headquartered in Los Angeles, with operations in over 70 countries through various subsidiaries, affiliates, and non-affiliated licensees and sub-publishers. We own or control rights to more than one million musical compositions, including numerous pop hits, American standards, folk songs and motion picture and theatrical compositions. Assembled over decades, our award-winning catalog includes over 100,000 songwriters and composers and a diverse range of genres including pop, rock, jazz, classical, country, R&B, hip-hop, rap, reggae, Latin, folk, blues, symphonic, soul, Broadway, electronic, alternative and gospel. Warner Chappell Music also administers the music and soundtracks of several third-party television and film producers and studios. We have an extensive production music catalog collectively branded as Warner Chappell Production Music.
Music Publishing revenues are derived from five main sources:
•Digital: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings distributed in streaming services, download services, digital performance and other digital music services;
•Performance: the rightsholder receives revenues if the musical composition is performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable and in retail locations (e.g. bars and restaurants), live performance at a concert or other venue (e.g., arena concerts and nightclubs), and performance of music in staged theatrical productions;
•Mechanical: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings sold in any physical format or configuration such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs;
•Synchronization: the rightsholder receives revenues for the right to use the musical composition in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games as well as from other uses such as in toys or novelty items and merchandise; and
•Other: the rightsholder receives revenues for use in sheet music and other uses.
The principal costs associated with our Music Publishing business are as follows:
•A&R costs: the costs associated with (i) paying royalties to songwriters, co-publishers and other copyright holders in connection with income generated from the uses of their works and (ii) signing and developing songwriters; and
•Selling and marketing, general overhead and other administrative expenses: the costs associated with selling and marketing, general overhead and other administrative expenses.
Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Comparability
COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak (also referred to as “COVID”) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The global pandemic and governmental responses thereto disrupted physical and manufacturing supply chains and required the closures of physical retailers, resulting in declines in our physical revenue streams at the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, stay-at-home orders, limited indoor and outdoor gatherings and other restrictions have negatively affected our business in other ways, such as, making it difficult to hold live concert tours, adversely impacting our concert promotion business and the sale of merchandise, delaying the release of new recordings and disrupting the production and release of motion pictures and television programs, which negatively affected licensing revenue in our Recorded Music business and synchronization revenue in our Music Publishing business. However, the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated growth of other revenue streams such as fitness and interactive gaming (including augmented reality and virtual reality), which may continue to grow. While global vaccination efforts are underway and businesses are beginning to reopen, it is unclear how long the global pandemic will last due to the possibility of new variants, increases in infection rates and renewed government action to slow the spread of the virus, and as such, it cannot be predicted to what extent the global pandemic will continue to impact the demand for our music and related services.
Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition at and for both the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were adversely affected by the global pandemic despite some recovery in fiscal year 2021 as businesses began to reopen and concerts and other live music resumed. The Company recognized a one-time $3 million credit loss reserve reversal impacting OIBDA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to one-time charges of $17 million impacting OIBDA and a total of $22 million impacting net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
Initial Public Offering
On June 5, 2020, we completed an IPO of Class A Common Stock. The sale of shares through the offering consisted entirely of secondary shares sold by Access. As a result, we incurred one-time costs associated with the IPO of approximately $89 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, $60 million of which relates to the Management Agreement as defined below. Following the IPO, our results of operations include expenses associated with being a public company, including auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors’ fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.
Senior Management Free Cash Flow Plan
On June 5, 2020, we amended our Second Amended and Restated Senior Management Free Cash Flow Plan (the “Plan”), which pays annual bonuses to certain executives based on our free cash flow and offers participants the opportunity to share in the appreciation of the value of our common stock, to remove the cash-settlement feature of the awards issued previously under the Plan. Our results of operations were adversely impacted by a non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $593 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, which reflects the mark-to-market adjustment through the modification date of the Plan for the change in value of our common stock upon consummation of the IPO. We incurred a non-cash stock-based compensation charge associated with a mark-to-market adjustment of $42 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
Subsequent to the amendment, the awards issued under the Plan were converted from liability-classified to equity-classified and therefore are no longer adjusted for changes in the value of our common stock. We continue to incur non-cash stock-based compensation expense for awards that were unvested as of the modification date of the Plan and for awards issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. We incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other related expenses of $47 million, $608 million and $50 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total expense of $608 million and $50 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019 include the charges of $593 million and $42 million, respectively, as described above.
Management Agreement
Upon completion of the Merger, the Company and Holdings entered into a management agreement with Access, dated as of the Merger Closing Date (the “Management Agreement”), pursuant to which Access provided the Company and its subsidiaries with financial, investment banking, management, advisory and other services. As a result of the completion of the IPO, the Management Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms and the Company paid to Access a one-time termination fee and a fee for transaction services in an aggregate amount of $60 million which was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. As the Management Agreement was terminated in June 2020, the Company incurred no costs associated with the Management Agreement for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Prior to the termination of the Management Agreement, the Company incurred costs associated with the Management Agreement of approximately $7 million and $11 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Such amounts have been included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 and Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2019
Consolidated Results
Revenues
The Company’s revenues were composed of the following amounts (in millions):
Total Revenues
2021 vs. 2020
Total revenues increased by $838 million, or 19%, to $5,301 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $4,463 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Prior to intersegment eliminations, Recorded Music revenues represented 86% and 85% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Prior to intersegment eliminations, Music Publishing revenues represented 14% and 15% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Prior to intersegment eliminations, U.S. and international revenues represented 45% and 55% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and 43% and 57% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, respectively.
Total digital revenues after intersegment eliminations increased by $636 million, or 22%, to $3,539 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $2,903 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Total digital revenues represented 67% and 65% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Prior to intersegment eliminations, total digital revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 were comprised of U.S. revenues of $1,769 million and international revenues of $1,772 million, or 50% of total digital revenues for each of U.S. and international revenues. Prior to intersegment eliminations, total digital revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 were comprised of U.S. revenues of $1,479 million and international revenues of $1,426 million, or 51% and 49% of total digital revenues, respectively.
Recorded Music revenues increased by $734 million, or 19%, to $4,544 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $3,810 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. U.S. Recorded Music revenues were $1,985 million and $1,609 million, or 44% and 42%, of consolidated Recorded Music revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. International Recorded Music revenues were $2,559 million and $2,201 million, or 56% and 58% of consolidated Recorded Music revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.
The overall increase in Recorded Music revenue was driven by increases in digital, physical, artist services and expanded-rights, and licensing revenue. Digital revenue increased by $537 million, or 21%, as a result of the continued growth in streaming services, including growth in emerging streaming platforms such as Facebook, TikTok and Peloton a well as strength of releases, which included new release from Cardi B, as well as carryover success from Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Ava Max, the Hamilton original cast recording, Bruno Mars, Roddy Ricch, Tones and I and YoungBoy Never Broke Again. Revenue from streaming services grew by $569 million or 24% to $2,972 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $2,403 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Streaming revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in download and other digital revenues of $32 million to $133 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $165 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 due to the continued shift to streaming services. Physical revenue increased by $115 million primarily from higher sales due to an increased demand for vinyl products, continued recovery from COVID disruption, as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $15 million. Artist services and expanded-rights revenue increased by $74 million primarily due to higher direct-to-consumer merchandising revenue at EMP and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchanges rates of $26 million, partially offset by a decrease in touring activity resulting from COVID disruption. Licensing revenue increased by $8 million primarily due to higher synchronization revenue as businesses continued to recover from COVID disruption and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $9 million, partially offset by lower compilation revenue and other COVID-impacted licensing revenue.
Music Publishing revenues increased by $104 million, or 16%, to $761 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $657 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. U.S. Music Publishing revenues were $378 million, or 50% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and $325 million, or 49% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. International Music Publishing revenues were $383 million, or 50% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and $332 million, or 51% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
The overall increase in Music Publishing revenue was mainly driven by increases in digital revenue of $99 million or 29%, synchronization revenue of $25 million or 21% and mechanical revenue of $1 million, partially offset by decreases in performance revenue of $20 million or 14% and other revenue of $1 million. The increase in digital revenue is primarily due to an increase in streaming revenue driven by the continued growth in streaming services, including emerging streaming platforms, and timing of new digital deals. Digital revenue growth in the year was impacted by a favorable one-time settlement in the prior year, as well as a shift in the collection of writer’s share of U.S. digital performance income from certain digital service providers. This change has no impact on Music Publishing OIBDA, but results in a slight improvement to OIBDA margin. The increase in synchronization revenue is attributable to higher motion picture and commercial income and a one-time licensing settlement. Mechanical revenue is up slightly due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in performance revenue is primarily driven by the impact of COVID disruption on bars, restaurants, concerts and live events, which have only partially recovered.
2020 vs. 2019
Total revenues decreased by $12 million, or 0%, to $4,463 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from $4,475 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Prior to intersegment eliminations, Recorded Music revenues represented 85% and 86% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Prior to intersegment eliminations, Music Publishing revenues represented 15% and 14% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Prior to intersegment eliminations, U.S. and international revenues represented 43% and 57% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and 44% and 56% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, respectively.
Total digital revenues after intersegment eliminations increased by $293 million, or 11%, to $2,903 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from $2,610 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Total digital revenues represented 65% and 58% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The increase in digital revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue is due to the continued growth in streaming revenue, which was largely uninterrupted by COVID-19, and the decrease in total consolidated revenue due to the business interruption impact of COVID-19. Prior to intersegment eliminations, total digital revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 were comprised of U.S. revenues of $1,479 million and international revenues of $1,426 million, or 51% and 49% of total digital revenues, respectively. Prior to intersegment eliminations, total digital revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 were comprised of U.S. revenues of $1,382 million and international revenues of $1,232 million, or 53% and 47% of total digital revenues, respectively.
Recorded Music revenues decreased by $30 million, or 1%, to $3,810 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from $3,840 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. U.S. Recorded Music revenues were $1,609 million and $1,656 million, or 42% and 43% of consolidated Recorded Music revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. International Recorded Music revenues were $2,201 million and $2,184 million, or 58% and 57% of consolidated Recorded Music revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively.
The overall decrease in Recorded Music revenue was driven by decreases in physical, artist services and expanded-rights, and licensing revenue partially offset by increases in digital revenue. Physical revenue decreased by $125 million primarily due to the continued shift from physical revenue to digital revenue, timing of releases, prior-year success of Johnny Hallyday and impact of the COVID-19 business interruption resulting in lower physical sales, offset by current year release success in Japan. Artist services and expanded-rights revenue decreased by $104 million primarily due to a decrease in touring activity and tour-related merchandising resulting from COVID-19 business interruption related tour postponements and cancellations, partially offset by higher e-commerce merchandising revenue. Licensing revenue decreased by $26 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower broadcast fees, synchronization revenue due to lower advertising, television and film deal activity, partially offset by $5 million of licensing settlements. Digital revenue increased by $225 million as a result of the continued growth in streaming services and strength of releases, which included new releases from Roddy Ricch, YoungBoy Never Broke Again and Dua Lipa, as well as carryover success from Ed Sheeran, Tones and I, Hamilton, Lizzo, Cardi B, and Young Thug. Revenue from streaming services grew by $274 million or 13% to $2,403 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from $2,129 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Streaming revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in download and other digital revenues of $49 million to $165 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from $214 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 due to the continued shift to streaming services.
Music Publishing revenues increased by $14 million, or 2%, to $657 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from $643 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. U.S. Music Publishing revenues were $325 million, or 49% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, and $300 million, or 47% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. International Music Publishing revenues were $332 million, or 51% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, and $343 million, or 53% of consolidated Music Publishing revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
The overall increase in Music Publishing revenue was mainly driven by an increase in digital revenue of $66 million or 24%, partially offset by decreases in performance revenue of $41 million or 22%, mechanical revenue of $7 million, synchronization revenue of $1 million and other revenue of $3 million. The increase in digital revenue mainly reflects the continued shift to streaming services. The decreases in Music Publishing performance revenue and mechanical revenue are primarily due to COVID-19 related business interruption and the timing of distributions.
Revenue by Geographical Location
2021 vs. 2020
U.S. revenue increased by $429 million, or 22%, to $2,363 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $1,934 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. U.S. Recorded Music revenue increased by $376 million or 23%. The primary driver was the increase in U.S. Recorded Music digital revenue of $239 million, or 18%, driven by the continued growth in streaming services. Streaming revenue increased by $255 million, or 21%, partially offset by $16 million of digital download and other digital declines. Increases are also attributable to the increase in U.S. Recorded Music physical revenue, which increased by $77 million from higher sales due to an increased demand for vinyl products and continued recovery from COVID disruption. U.S artist services and expanded rights revenue increased by $59 million driven by higher advertising and social platform revenues, as well as merchandising revenues and U.S licensing revenue increased by $1 million primarily due to higher synchronization revenue, partially offset by lower compilation revenue. U.S. Music Publishing revenue increased by $53 million or 16%. This was primarily driven by the increase in U.S. Music Publishing digital revenue of $51 million, or 27%, due to the continued growth in streaming services, including emerging streaming platforms, and timing of new digital deals, partially offset by a shift in the collection of writer’s share of U.S. digital performance income from certain digital service providers. The increase in synchronization revenue of $11 million is due to higher motion picture and commercial income and a one-time licensing settlement. Increases are partially offset by the decrease in performance revenue of $7 million due to the impact of COVID disruption and mechanical revenue of $2 million from the continuing shift to streaming services.
International revenue increased by $409 million, or 16%, to $2,942 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from $2,533 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international revenue increased by $280 million or 11%. International Recorded Music revenue increased $358 million primarily due to an increase in digital revenue of $298 million, or 23%, physical revenue of $38 million, artist services and expanded-rights revenue of $15 million and licensing revenue of $7 million. International Recorded Music digital revenue increased due to a $314 million, or
26%, increase in streaming services revenue, partially offset by a $16 million decline in download and other digital revenue. The increase in international Recorded Music streaming revenue was due to the continued growth in streaming services internationally. International Recorded Music physical revenue increased from higher sales due to an increased demand for vinyl products, continued recovery from COVID disruption, as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. International Recorded Music artist services and expanded-rights revenue increased primarily due to the growth in EMP direct-to-consumer merchandise revenue and favorable impact of foreign currency exchanges rates, partially offset by the decrease in touring activity resulting from COVID disruption. International Recorded Music licensing revenue increased due to higher synchronization revenue and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by lower compilation revenue and other COVID-impacted licensing revenue.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Financial Condition at September 30, 2021
At September 30, 2021, we had $3.346 billion of debt (which is net of $37 million of premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs), $499 million of cash and equivalents (net debt of $2.847 billion, defined as total debt, less cash and equivalents and premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs) and $31 million of Warner Music Group Corp. equity. This compares to $3.104 billion of debt (which is net of $23 million of premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs), $553 million of cash and equivalents (net debt of $2.551 billion) and $63 million of Warner Music Group Corp. deficit at September 30, 2020.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our historical cash flows (in millions). The financial data for fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 have been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $638 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $463 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and $400 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The primary driver of the $175 million, or 38%, increase in cash provided by operating activities during the current year was primarily due to an increase in OIBDA offset by a decrease in non-cash equity compensation expense and continued A&R investment driving a use of cash from working capital.
The increase in results from operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 reflected timing of working capital partially offset by higher taxes paid and increased cash A&R investments.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $638 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $219 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and $376 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.

The $316 million of cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of the tender for and repayment of Acquisition Corp.’s 5.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 of $300 million, repayment of Acquisition Corp.’s 4.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 of $220 million, repayment of Acquisition Corp.’s 4.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 of $349 million, partial repayment of Acquisition Corp.’s Senior Term Loan Facility due 2023 of $506 million, call premiums paid on and redemption deposits for early redemption of the aforementioned Senior Secured Notes of $23 million, dividends paid of $344 million and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of $7 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of Acquisition Corp.’s 3.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 of $535 million, proceeds from the issuance of Acquisition Corp.’s 2.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 of $365 million, and proceeds from the issuance of Acquisition Corp.’s 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 of $550 million. Proceeds from issuance of Senior Secured Notes were offset by deferred financing costs paid of $17 million.

There were no drawdowns on the Revolving Credit Facility during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our subsidiaries’ operations, available cash and equivalents and funds available for drawing under our Revolving Credit Facility. These sources of liquidity are needed to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and dividends, prepayments of debt, repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes or repurchases of our outstanding equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, we may elect to pay or make in the future.
We believe that our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months.
We are continuing our financial transformation initiative, launched in August 2019, to upgrade our information technology and finance infrastructure, including related systems and processes, for which we currently expect upfront costs to be approximately $150 million, which includes capital expenditures of approximately $55 million. There has been a slight delay in the timing of the transformation initiative as a result of the ongoing effects of COVID-19, but it is still expected to be delivered in fiscal year 2022. Annualized run-rate savings from the financial transformation initiative are expected to be between approximately $35 million and $40 million once fully implemented starting in fiscal 2023. We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund these expenditures.
Debt Capital Structure
Since Access acquired us in 2011, we have sought to extend the maturity dates on our outstanding indebtedness, reduce interest expense and improve our debt ratings. For example, our S&P corporate credit rating improved from B in 2017 to BB+ in July 2021 with a stable outlook, and our Moody’s corporate family rating improved from B1 in 2016 to Ba3 in 2020. In addition, our weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness has decreased from 10.5% in 2011 to 3.2% as of September 30, 2021. Our nearest-term maturity date is in 2028. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to take opportunistic steps to extend our maturity dates and reduce related interest expense. From time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness for, among other things, working capital, repurchasing, redeeming or tendering for existing indebtedness and acquisitions or other strategic transactions.
2.250% Senior Secured Notes Offering and Redemption of 3.625% Senior Secured Notes
On August 16, 2021, Acquisition Corp. issued and sold €445 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031. Net proceeds of the offering, together with available cash, were used to redeem in full all of the outstanding 3.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026.
3.750% Senior Secured Notes Offering
On November 17, 2021, Acquisition Corp. priced $540 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “3.750% Senior Secured Notes”). We expect the issuance to close on November 24, 2021. Net proceeds of the offering are expected to be used to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration for potential acquisitions of certain music and music-related assets, or if any of such potential acquisitions are not completed, for general corporate purposes. We may also use the net proceeds of the offering to redeem all or a portion of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes (so long as, in the case of a partial redemption, at least $250 million of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding following such redemption) at any time on one or more occasions on or prior to the fifth business day following December 20, 2021 by giving notice at least five business days prior to such time at the special optional redemption price equal to the issue price of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes plus 1% of the principal amount thereof together with accrued and unpaid interest on such 3.750% Senior Secured Notes from the date of issuance to but excluding the redemption date.
Revolving Credit Facility
On January 31, 2018, Acquisition Corp. entered into the revolving credit agreement (as amended by the amendment dated October 9, 2019 and as further amended, amended and restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) for a senior secured revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions and lenders from time to time party thereto (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). On April 3, 2020, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) which, among other things, increased the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from an aggregate principal amount of $180 million to an aggregate principal amount of $300 million and extended the final maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from January 31, 2023 to April 3, 2025. For a more detailed description of the changes effected by the Second Amendment, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.
On March 1, 2021, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment (the “Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment”) to the Revolving Credit Agreement among Acquisition Corp., the several banks and other financial institutions party thereto and Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, governing Acquisition Corp.’s revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions and lenders from time to time party thereto. The Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment (among other changes) adds certain exceptions and increases the leverage ratio below which Acquisition Corp. can access certain baskets in connection with Acquisition Corp.’s negative covenants, including those related to incurrence of indebtedness, restricted payments and covenant suspension. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein.
Acquisition Corp. is the borrower under the Revolving Credit Agreement which provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $300 million and includes a $90 million letter of credit sub-facility. Amounts are available under the Revolving Credit Facility in U.S. dollars, euros or pounds sterling. The Revolving Credit Agreement permits loans for general corporate purposes and may also be utilized to issue letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at Acquisition Corp.’s election at a rate equal to (i) the rate for deposits in the borrowing currency in the London interbank market (adjusted for maximum reserves) for the applicable interest period (“Revolving LIBOR”) plus 1.875% per annum, or (ii) the base rate, which is the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent from time to time, (y) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (z) the one-month Revolving LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum, plus, in each case, 0.875% per annum; provided that, for each of clauses (i) and (ii), the applicable margin with respect to such loans is subject to adjustment upon achievement of certain leverage ratios as set forth in a leverage-based pricing grid in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Based on the Senior Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio of 2.84x at September 30, 2021, the applicable margin for Eurodollar loans would be 1.375% instead of 1.875% and the applicable margin for ABR loans would be 0.375% instead of 0.875% in the case of 2020 Revolving Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement).
Prepayments
If, at any time, the aggregate amount of outstanding loans (including letters of credit outstanding thereunder) exceeds the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, prepayments of the loans (and after giving effect to such prepayment the cash collateralization of letters of credit) will be required in an amount equal to such excess. The application of proceeds from mandatory prepayments shall not reduce the aggregate amount of then effective commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and amounts prepaid may be reborrowed, subject to then effective commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the Commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are permitted at any time in certain minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty. Voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are permitted at any time in certain minimum principal amounts, subject to reimbursement of the lenders’ redeployment costs actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR-based borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.
Senior Term Loan Facility
Acquisition Corp. is party to a $1,145 million senior secured term loan credit facility, pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1, 2012, as amended or supplemented (the “Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other financial institutions and lenders from time to time party thereto (as described below, the “Senior Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Senior Credit Facilities”).
On January 20, 2021, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment (the “Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment”) to the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment (among other changes) (i) extends the maturity date of its outstanding term loans from November 1, 2023 to January 20, 2028 and (ii) removes a number of negative covenants limiting the ability of Acquisition Corp. to take various actions. The remaining negative covenants are limited to restrictions on liens, restrictions on fundamental changes and change of control, and are in a form substantially similar to the negative covenants in the 2.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2028, 3.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030, 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 and 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031.
On April 14, 2021, Acquisition Corp. borrowed additional term loans in an amount of $325 million under the Increase Supplement as described further in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. The Increase Supplement was entered into to provide for the redemption of Acquisition Corp.’s 5.500% Senior Notes due 2026. Following such borrowing, there was an aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement of $1,145 million.
General
Acquisition Corp. is the borrower under the Senior Term Loan Facility (the “Term Loan Borrower”). The loans outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Facility mature on January 20, 2028.
In addition, the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement provides the right for individual lenders to extend the maturity date of their loans upon the request of the Term Loan Borrower and without the consent of any other lender.
Subject to certain conditions, without the consent of the then existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), the Senior Term Loan Facility may be expanded (or a new term loan facility entered into) by up to the greater of (i) $300 million and (ii) such additional amount as would not cause the net senior secured leverage ratio, after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional amount and any use of proceeds thereof, to exceed 4.50:1.00.
Interest Rates and Fees
Term loan borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at Acquisition Corp.’s option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate, LIBOR, not less than 0.00% per annum plus a borrowing margin of 2.125% per annum or (ii) an alternative base rate plus a borrowing margin of 1.125% per annum.
Prepayments
The Senior Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayment and reduction in an amount equal to (a) 50% of excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement), with reductions to 25% and zero based upon achievement of a net senior secured leverage ratio of less than or equal to 4.50:1.00 or 4.00:1.00, respectively, (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the incurrence of indebtedness by the Term Loan Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries (other than indebtedness permitted under the Senior Term Loan Facility) and (c) 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions
of property by the Term Loan Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (including certain insurance and condemnation proceeds) in excess of $75 million and subject to the right of the Term Loan Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to reinvest such proceeds within a specified period of time, and other exceptions. Voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts of $1 million or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, subject to reimbursement of the lenders’ redeployment costs actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of adjusted LIBOR borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.

General Terms of Our Indebtedness
Certain terms of the Senior Credit Facilities and certain terms of each series of notes under our Secured Notes Indenture are described below.
Ranking
The indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes are Acquisition Corp.’s senior secured obligations and are secured on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future indebtedness secured with the same security arrangements. The Secured Notes rank senior in right of payment to Acquisition Corp.’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness; rank equally in right of payment with all of Acquisition Corp.’s existing and future senior indebtedness and any future senior secured credit facility; are effectively senior to Acquisition Corp.’s unsecured senior indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the senior secured obligations; and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of Acquisition Corp.’s non-guarantor subsidiaries (other than indebtedness and liabilities owed to Acquisition Corp. or one of its subsidiary guarantors (as such term is defined below)).
Guarantees and Security
The obligations under each of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture are guaranteed by each direct and indirect U.S. restricted subsidiary of Acquisition Corp., other than certain excluded subsidiaries. All obligations of Acquisition Corp. and each guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture are secured by substantially all the assets of Acquisition Corp and each subsidiary guarantor.
Covenants, Representations and Warranties
The Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes contain customary representations and warranties and certain affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants applicable to securities issued pursuant to the Secured Notes Indenture, Senior Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility limit the ability of Acquisition Corp. and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, create liens and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility includes additional covenants, which are incurrence-based high yield covenants and limit the ability of Acquisition Corp. and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; repurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to it or make other intercompany transfers; transfer or sell assets; enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These additional covenants are currently suspended. These covenants will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.’s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.
The negative covenants are subject to customary exceptions. There are no financial covenants included in the Revolving Credit Agreement, other than a springing leverage ratio of 5.00:1.00 (with no step-down), which is not tested, unless at the end of a fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and drawings under letters of credit which have not been reimbursed exceeds $105 million. There are no financial covenants included in the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Secured Notes Indenture.
Events of Default
Events of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture include, as applicable, nonpayment of principal when due, nonpayment of interest or other amounts, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, violation of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration to other material debt, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA events, certain material judgments, actual or asserted invalidity of security interests in excess of $50 million, or $75 million in the case of the Secured Notes Indenture, in each case subject to customary thresholds, notice and grace period provisions.
Change of Control
Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Secured Notes Indenture, each holder of the Secured Notes has the right to require Acquisition Corp. to repurchase some or all of such holder’s Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
Existing Debt as of September 30, 2021
As of September 30, 2021, our long-term debt, all of which was issued by Acquisition Corp., was as follows (in millions):
______________________________________
(a)Reflects $300 million of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, less letters of credit outstanding of approximately $7 million at September 30, 2021. There were no loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2021.
Dividends
The Company’s ability to pay dividends may be restricted by covenants in the credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility which are currently suspended but which will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.’s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.
The Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The declaration of each dividend will continue to be at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and will depend on the Company’s financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, restrictions imposed by Delaware law, general business conditions and any other factors that the Company’s board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will pay any dividends to holders of the Company’s common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.
On August 13, 2021, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share on the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as well as related payments under certain stock-based compensation plans, which was paid on September 1, 2021.
The Company paid cash dividends to stockholders and participating security holders of $265 million, $344 million and $94 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
On November 9, 2021, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share on the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as well as related payments under certain stock-based compensation plans, payable on December 1, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2021.
Covenant Compliance
The Company was in compliance with its covenants under its outstanding notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2021.
On January 18, 2019, we delivered a notice to the trustee under the 2012 Secured Indenture and 2014 Unsecured Indenture changing the Fixed GAAP Date, as defined under the indentures, to October 1, 2018. Under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture, the Fixed GAAP Date is set for April 3, 2020, other than in respect of capital leases, which are frozen at November 1, 2012.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains a springing leverage ratio that is tied to a ratio based on EBITDA, which is defined under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Our ability to borrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility may depend upon our ability to meet the leverage ratio test at the end of a fiscal quarter to the extent we have drawn a certain amount of revolving loans. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein. EBITDA as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility is based on Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility), both of which terms differ from the terms “EBITDA” and “net income” as they are commonly used. For example, the calculation of EBITDA under the Revolving Credit Facility, in addition to adjusting net income to exclude interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, also adjusts net income by excluding items or expenses such as, among other items, (1) the amount of any restructuring charges or reserves; (2) any non-cash charges (including any impairment charges); (3) any net loss resulting from hedging currency exchange risks; (4) the amount of management, monitoring, consulting and advisory fees paid to Access; (5) business optimization expenses (including consolidation initiatives, severance costs and other costs relating to initiatives aimed at profitability improvement); (6) transaction expenses; (7) equity-based compensation expense; and (8) certain extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. The definition of EBITDA under the Revolving Credit Facility also includes adjustments for the pro forma impact of certain projected cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies and any quality of earnings analysis prepared by independent certified public accountants in connection with an acquisition, merger, consolidation or other investment. The Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture use financial measures called “Consolidated EBITDA” or “EBITDA” and “Consolidated Net Income” that have substantially the same definitions to EBITDA and Consolidated Net Income, each as defined under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
EBITDA as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility (referred to in this section as “Adjusted EBITDA”) is presented herein because it is a material component of the leverage ratio contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Non-compliance with the leverage ratio could result in the inability to use the Revolving Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income or cash from operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we may consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the Revolving Credit Agreement allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict.
Adjusted EBITDA as presented below should not be used by investors as an indicator of performance for any future period. Further, our debt instruments require that it be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter. Further, it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four quarter period or any complete fiscal year. In addition, our debt instruments require that the leverage ratio be calculated on a pro forma basis for certain transactions including acquisitions as if such transactions had occurred on the first date of the measurement period and may include expected cost savings and synergies resulting from or related to any such transaction. There can be no assurances that any such cost savings or synergies will be achieved in full.
In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business; (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is a U.S. GAAP measure of our operating results, to Adjusted EBITDA as defined, for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters, or the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020. In addition, the reconciliation includes the calculation of the Senior Secured Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as the Leverage Ratio, under the Revolving Credit Agreement for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters, or the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. The terms and related calculations are defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement. All amounts in the reconciliation below reflect Acquisition Corp. (in millions, except ratios):
______________________________________
(a)Reflects loss on extinguishment of debt, primarily including tender fees and unamortized deferred financing costs.
(b)Reflects net gain on sale of securities and divestitures.
(c)Reflects severance costs and other restructuring related expenses.
(d)Reflects (gains) losses from hedging activities and unrealized (gains) losses due to foreign exchange on our Euro-denominated debt and intercompany transactions.
(e)Reflects management fees and related expenses paid to Access pursuant to the management agreement, which was terminated upon completion of the IPO in June 2020.
(f)Reflects mainly integration, transaction and qualifying IPO costs.
(g)Reflects costs associated with our transformation initiatives and IT system updates, which includes costs of $10 million and $33 million related to our finance transformation for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, as well as $5 million and $30 million for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.
(h)Reflects non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the Second Amended and Restated Warner Music Group Corp. Senior Management Free Cash Flow Plan and the Omnibus Incentive Plan.
(i)Reflects non-cash activity, including the unrealized losses (gains) on the mark-to-market of an equity method investment, investment losses (gains) and other non-cash impairments.
(j)Reflects expected savings resulting from transformation initiatives and the pro forma impact of specified transactions for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Certain of these cost savings initiatives and transactions impacted quarters prior to the quarter during which they were identified within the last twelve-month period. The pro forma impact of these specified transactions and initiatives resulted in a $6 million increase in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA.
(k)Reflects the balance of senior secured debt at Acquisition Corp. of approximately $3.346 billion less cash of $250 million.
(l)Reflects the ratio of Senior Secured Indebtedness, including Revolving Credit Agreement Indebtedness, to Adjusted EBITDA. This is calculated net of cash and equivalents of the Company as of September 30, 2021 not exceeding $250 million. If the outstanding aggregate principal amount of borrowings and drawings under letters of credit which have not been reimbursed under our Revolving Credit Facility is greater than $105 million at the end of a fiscal quarter, the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility is 5.00:1.00. The Company’s Revolving Credit Facility does not impose any “leverage ratio” maintenance requirement on the Company when the aggregate principal amount of borrowings and drawings under letters of credit, which have not been reimbursed under the Revolving Credit Facility, is less than or
equal to $105 million at the end of a fiscal quarter. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein.
Summary
Management believes that funds generated from our operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. We also have additional borrowing capacity under our indentures and the Senior Term Loan Facility. However, our ability to continue to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other industry-specific factors such as the ability to control music piracy and the continued transition from physical to digital formats in the recorded music and music publishing industries. It could also be affected by the severity and duration of natural or man-made disasters, including pandemics such as COVID-19. We and our affiliates continue to evaluate opportunities to, from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to pay dividends or prepay outstanding debt or repurchase or retire Acquisition Corp.’s outstanding debt or debt securities or repurchase our outstanding equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings. In addition, from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, we may seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or our outstanding debt or debt securities with existing cash and/or with funds provided from additional borrowings.
Contractual and Other Obligations
Firm Commitments
The following table summarizes the Company’s aggregate contractual obligations at September 30, 2021, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flow in future periods.
______________________________________
The following is a description of our firmly committed contractual obligations at September 30, 2021:
(1)Outstanding debt obligations consist of the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Notes. These obligations have been presented based on the principal amounts due as of September 30, 2021. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, bond premiums, discounts or unamortized deferred financing costs.
(2)Operating lease obligations primarily relate to the minimum lease rental obligations for our real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world.
(3)The Company routinely enters into long-term commitments with recording artists, songwriters and publishers for the future delivery of music. Such commitments generally become due only upon delivery and Company acceptance of albums from the artists or future musical compositions by songwriters and publishers. Additionally, such commitments are typically cancellable at the Company’s discretion, generally without penalty. Based on contractual obligations, aggregate firm commitments to such talent approximate $537 million at September 30, 2021. The aggregate firm commitments expected for the next twelve-month period based on contractual obligations and the Company’s expected release schedule approximates $303 million at September 30, 2021.
(4)We have minimum funding commitments and other related obligations to support the operations of various investments, which are reflected in the table above. Other long-term liabilities, which are not included in the table above, include $12 million and $12 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released.
*Because the timing of payment, and even whether payment occurs, is dependent upon the timing of delivery of albums and musical compositions, the timing and amount of payment of these commitments as presented in the above summary can vary significantly.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 60, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies” (“FRR 60”), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in our application. We believe the following list represents critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.
Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We account for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as required by ASC 350. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis and when events occur that may suggest that the fair value of such assets cannot support the carrying value. ASC 350 gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify the impairment and measure the amount of an impairment loss to be recognized (if applicable).
As of September 30, 2021, we had recorded goodwill in the amount of $1.830 billion, including $1.366 billion and $464 million for our Recorded Music and Music Publishing businesses, respectively, primarily related to the Merger and PLG Acquisition. As of September 30, 2021, we had recorded definite-lived intangible assets of $2.017 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $154 million. We test our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as of July 1. We performed a qualitative assessment for our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2021. This assessment considered changes in our projected future cash flows and discount rates, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our goodwill and intangible assets.
Revenue and Cost Recognition
Revenues
Recorded Music
As required by FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when, or as, control of the promised services or goods is transferred to our customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is contractually due in exchange for those services or goods. The Company’s revenue recognition process involves several applications that are responsible for the initiation and processing of transactions in order to recognize revenue in accordance with the Company’s policy and ASC 606.
Revenues from the sale or license of Recorded Music products through digital distribution channels are typically recognized when sale or usage occurs based on usage reports received from the customer. Certain contracts contain minimum guarantees, which are recoupable against royalties. Upon contract inception, the Company will assess whether a shortfall or breakage is expected (i.e., where the minimum guarantee will not be recouped through royalties) in order to determine timing of revenue recognition for the minimum guarantee.
For fixed fee contracts and minimum guarantee contracts where breakage is expected, the total transaction price (fixed fee or minimum guarantee) is typically recognized using an appropriate measure of progress over the contractual term. The Company updates its assessment of the transaction price each reporting period to see if anticipated royalty earnings exceed the minimum guarantee. For contracts where breakage is not expected, royalties are recognized as revenue as sales or usage occurs based upon the licensee’s usage reports and, when these reports are not available, revenue is based on historical data, industry information and other relevant trends.
Music Publishing
Music Publishing revenues are earned from the receipt of royalties relating to the licensing of rights in musical compositions and the sale of published sheet music and songbooks. The receipt of royalties principally relates to amounts earned from the public performance of musical compositions, the mechanical reproduction of musical compositions on recorded media, including digital formats and the use of musical compositions in synchronization with visual images. Music publishing royalties, except for synchronization royalties, generally are recognized when the sale or usage occurs. The most common form of consideration for publishing contracts is sales- and usage-based royalties. The collecting societies submit usage reports, typically with payment for royalties due, often on a quarterly or biannual reporting period, in arrears. Royalties are recognized as the sale or usage occurs based upon usage reports and, when these reports are not available, royalties are estimated based on historical data, such as recent royalties reported, company-specific information with respect to changes in repertoire, industry information and other relevant trends. Synchronization revenue is typically recognized as revenue when control of the license is transferred to the customer in accordance with ASC 606.
Accounting for Royalty Costs and Royalty Advances
The Company incurs royalty costs that are payable to our recording artists and songwriters generated from the sale or license of our Recorded Music catalog and Music Publishing copyrights. Royalties are calculated using negotiated rates in accordance with recording artist and songwriter contracts. Calculations are based on revenue earned or user/usage measures or a combination of these. There are instances where such data is not available to be processed and royalty cost calculations may be complex or involve judgments about significant volumes of data to be processed and analyzed.
We had $1,880 million and $1,628 million of royalty payables in our balance sheet at September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.
In many instances, the Company commits to pay our recording artists and songwriters royalties in advance of future sales. The Company accounts for these advances under the related guidance in FASB ASC Topic 928, Entertainment-Music (“ASC 928”). Under ASC 928, the Company capitalizes as assets certain advances that it believes are recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the recording artist or songwriter. Recoverability is assessed upon initial commitment of the advance based upon the Company’s forecast of anticipated revenue from the sale of future and existing albums or musical compositions. In determining whether the advance is recoverable, the Company evaluates the current and past popularity of the recording artist or songwriter, the sales history of the recording artist or songwriter, the initial or expected commercial acceptability of the product, the current and past popularity of the genre of music that the product is designed to appeal to, and other relevant factors. Advances vary in both amount and expected life based on the underlying recording artist or songwriter. To the extent that a portion of an outstanding advance is no longer deemed recoverable, that amount will be expensed in the period the determination is made.
We had $830 million and $489 million of advances in our balance sheet at September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. We believe such advances are recoverable through future royalties to be earned by the applicable recording artists and songwriters.
Accounting for Income Taxes
As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period generally represent sufficient negative evidence to consider a valuation allowance under the provisions of ASC 740. As a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance.
The realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established. The valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. An ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment and reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings.
From time to time, the Company engages in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. The Company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. In determining the Company’s tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions, unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merits. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the Company’s tax returns are more likely than not of being sustained.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation represents compensation payment for which the amounts are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the Company’s IPO, the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Senior Management Free Cash Flow Plan (the “Plan”) was classified as a liability rather than equity under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). In February 2020, the Company filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which required a change in accounting policy during the three months ended March 31, 2020 from the intrinsic value method to fair value method in determining the basis of measurement of its stock-based compensation liability.
In determining fair value, the Company utilized an option pricing model for those awards with an option-like pay-off, which includes various inputs for volatility, term to exit, discount for lack of marketability, expected dividend yield and risk-free rates. For awards with an equity-like pay-off, inputs for discount of lack of marketability and non-performance risk were considered. The Company continued to use an income approach using a discounted cash flow model to determine its per-share value input within the model. Upon completion of the IPO in June 2020, the Plan was amended to remove the cash-settlement feature on all future redemptions. As a result, all awards previously issued under the Plan will require settlement in Class A Common Stock. Under the provision of ASC 718, the Company determined the Plan was modified as of June 3, 2020, and as such, converted the awards from liability-classified to equity-classified. Prior to conversion, the Company performed a final measurement of its stock-based compensation liability under the fair value method. Subsequent to the amendment, the awards issued under the Plan will no longer be adjusted for changes in the value of the Company’s common stock.
