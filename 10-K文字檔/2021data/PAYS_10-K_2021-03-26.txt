Overview
Paysign, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of prepaid card products and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications. Our payment solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, increase patient adherence rates, reduce administration costs, and streamline operations. Public sector organizations can utilize our payment solutions to disburse public benefits or for internal payments. We market our prepaid card solutions under our Paysign brand. As we are a payment processor and prepaid card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the prepaid card lifecycle.
We provide a card processing platform consisting of proprietary systems and software applications based on the unique needs of our clients. We have extended our processing business capabilities through our proprietary Paysign platform. Through the Paysign platform, we provide a variety of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service. The Paysign platform was built on modern cross-platform architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform has allowed the Company to significantly expand its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments space through its flexibility and ease of customization. The Paysign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to our partners.
We have developed prepaid card programs for corporate incentive and rewards including, but not limited to, consumer rebates and rewards, donor compensation, clinical trials, healthcare reimbursement payments and pharmaceutical payment assistance. We have expanded our product offerings to include additional corporate incentive products and demand deposit accounts accessible with a debit card. In the future, we expect to further expand our product offerings into other prepaid card offerings such as payroll cards, travel cards, and expense reimbursement cards. Our cards are sponsored by our issuing bank partners.
Our revenues include fees generated from cardholder fees, interchange, card program management fees, and settlement income. Revenue from cardholder fees, interchange and card program management fees is recorded when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Settlement income is recorded at the expiration of the card program.
We have two categories for our prepaid cards: (1) corporate and consumer reloadable, and (2) non-reloadable cards.
Reloadable Cards: These types of cards are generally classified as payroll or considered general purpose reloadable (“GPR”) cards. Payroll cards are issued by an employer to an employee in order to allow the employee to access payroll amounts that are deposited into an account linked to their card. GPR cards can also be issued to a consumer at a retail location or mailed to a consumer after completing an on-line application. GPR cards can be reloaded multiple times with a consumer’s payroll, government benefit, a federal or state tax refund, or through cash reload networks located at retail locations. Reloadable cards are generally open-loop cards as described below.
Non-Reloadable Cards: These are generally one-time use cards that are only active until the funds initially loaded to the card are spent. These types of cards are generally used as gift or incentive cards. Normally these types of cards are used for purchase of goods or services at retail locations and cannot be used to receive cash.
Both reloadable and non-reloadable cards may be open-loop, closed-loop, or restricted-loop. Open-loop cards can be used to receive cash at ATM locations by PIN; or purchase goods or services by PIN or signature at retail locations virtually anywhere that the network brand (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa, etc.) is accepted. Closed-loop cards can only be used at a specific merchant. Restricted-loop cards can be used at several merchants, or a defined group of merchants, such as all merchants at a specific shopping mall.
The prepaid card market is one of the fastest growing segments of the payments industry in the U.S. This market has experienced significant growth in recent years due to consumers and merchants embracing improved technology, greater convenience, more product choices and greater flexibility. Prepaid cards have also proven to be an attractive alternative to traditional bank accounts for certain segments of the population, particularly those without, or who could not qualify for, a checking or savings account.
We manage all aspects of the prepaid card lifecycle, from managing the card design and approval processes with partners and networks, to production, packaging, distribution, and personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card management, and replacement. We deploy a fully staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bilingual customer service representatives, Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”), and two-way short message service (“SMS”) messaging and text alerts.
Currently, we are focusing our marketing efforts on corporate incentive and expense prepaid card products in various market verticals including but not limited to general corporate expense, healthcare related markets including co-pay assistance, clinical trials and donor compensation, loyalty rewards, and incentive cards.
As part of our continuing platform expansion process, we evaluate current and emerging technologies for applicability to our existing and future technology platform. To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints. Our principal target markets for processing services include prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers, small third-party processors, and small and mid-size financial institutions in the United States and Mexico.
We have devoted more extensive resources to sales and marketing activities as we have added essential personnel to our marketing and sales team. We sell our products directly to customers in the U.S. but may work with a small number of resellers and third parties in international markets to identify, sell and support targeted opportunities. We have also identified opportunities in the European Union and are pursuing those opportunities.
In 2021, we plan to continue to invest additional funds in technology improvements, sales and marketing, customer service, and regulatory compliance. From time to time we evaluate raising capital to enable us to diversify into new market verticals. If we do not raise new capital, we believe that we will still be able to expand into new markets using internally generated funds.
2020 Year Milestones
· Grew to approximately 3.5 million cardholders and 360 card programs as of December 31, 2020.
· Year over year revenue declined 30%.
· Added 55 Plasma programs, a net of 5 new Pharmaceutical programs, and 1 additional Corporate Incentive program.
Results of Operations
Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our consolidated financial results:
The decrease in total revenues of $10,546,219 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year consisted of a $3,593,861 reduction in Plasma revenue and a $7,046,291 reduction in Pharma revenue. The decrease in Plasma revenue was primarily due to a decrease in plasma donations and dollars loaded to card, significantly impacted by COVID-19 related donation center closures and mobility restrictions, which also resulted in a reduction in card load fees. The Pharma revenue decrease included a $6,293,203 adjustment for a change in accounting estimate in recognizing settlement income for Pharma programs based on substantially different performance indicators observed, current trends in the industry regarding program management by third parties, and new information available in dollar loads and spending patterns compared to historical experiences. This change resulted in the Company constraining revenue on all Pharma programs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Based on the recently observed change in facts and circumstances, the Company utilizes the remote method of revenue recognition for settlement income whereby the unspent balances will be recognized as revenue at the expiration of the cards and the respective program. This has resulted in the reversal of all previously recognized settlement income for all current Pharma programs. Pharma programs were also negatively impacted by COVID-19 as new pharmaceutical medicines were delayed and individuals limited their exposure to pharmacies and doctor offices.
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $608,150 compared to the same period in the prior year. Cost of revenues is comprised of transaction processing fees, data connectivity and data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production costs, customer service, program management, application integration setup, and sales and commission expense. There was a favorable cost variance of $4,692,617 due to the variable cost structure associated with a decrease in transactions, offset by an unfavorable cost variance of $4,084,467 resulting from a decrease in higher margin Pharma revenue and fixed costs primarily resulting from the change in accounting estimate and the revenue recognition for settlement income.
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $9,938,069 compared to the prior year resulting from the reduction in revenue described above, and the disproportionate decrease in cost of sales. The decrease in gross margin resulted from the lower revenue conversion rate and an unfavorable cost of revenue rate variance.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $3,434,751 or 29.5% compared to the prior year and consisted primarily of an increase in staffing and compensation of $1,804,000, professional services for legal, accounting, tax, and consultants of $690,000, stock-based compensation of $443,000, technologies and telecom of $494,000, and rent of $409,000 related to a new office lease entered into in June 2020; offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment of $325,000 due to COVID-19 restrictions in 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we reviewed the carrying value of acquisition costs related to a business license and determined that there was an impairment necessary as the efforts to acquire the license had been suspended. An impairment of intangible asset of $382,414 was recorded.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $641,622 compared to the prior year. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to continued capitalization of new technologies and enhancements to our processing platform and infrastructure.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss from operations of $8,338,100, a decrease of $14,439,754 from the period ending December 31, 2019, related to the aforementioned factors.
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $350,396 related to a decrease in interest income resulting primarily from the reduction in the federal funds rate to near 0% beginning in the first quarter of 2020.
The effective tax rate was (10.8%) and (13.9%) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The effective tax rates vary, primarily as a result of the tax benefit related to our stock-based compensation and a valuation allowance and pretax loss in the current year period.
The net income (loss) attributable to Paysign, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $16,595,881. The overall change in net income (loss) attributable to Paysign, Inc. relates to the aforementioned factors.
Key Metrics, Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures
Management reviews a number of metrics to help us monitor the performance of and identify trends affecting our business. We believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual revenues:
Gross Dollar Volume Loaded on Cards - Represents the total dollar volume of funds loaded to all of our card programs. Our gross dollar volume was $968 million and $882 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We use this metric to analyze the total amount of money moving into our card programs.
Conversion Rate on Gross Dollar Volume Loaded on Cards - Represents the percent of total gross dollar load volume onto our card programs that is converted into revenue, gross profit and net profit dollars. Our revenue conversion rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 2.49% or 249 basis points (“bps”), and 3.93% or 393 bps, respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded on cards. Our gross profit conversion rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 0.96% or 96 bps, and 2.18% or 218 bps, respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded on cards. Our net profit conversion rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were (0.95%) or (95) bps, and 0.84% or 84 bps, respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded on cards. The decline in conversion rates was primarily attributable to a change in accounting estimate for Pharma settlement income.
Management also reviews key performance indicators, such as revenues, gross profits, operational expenses as a percent of revenues, and cardholder participation. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or "adjusted") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity, and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment and investment in new card programs. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenues, operating income, net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:
“EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and "Adjusted EBITDA" reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude stock-based compensation expense, impairment of intangible asset and loss on abandonment of assets. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Paysign Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the table below.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for our last two fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Comparison of Fiscal 2020 and 2019
In fiscal 2020 and 2019, we financed our operations through internally generated funds.
Operating activities provided $13,775,819 of cash in 2020, a decrease of $2,936,960 in cash generated compared to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the increase in the customer card funding liability offset by the decrease in net income (loss) and deferred income taxes. The increase in the card funding liability is partially related to the change in estimate and reversal of previously recognized settlement income on Pharma programs.
Investing activities used $3,344,855 of cash in 2020, as compared to $3,237,134 of cash in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in fixed assets purchased during the current year and ongoing enhancements to our processing platform and infrastructure. The purchase of intangible assets decreased $1.2 million due to the acquisition of customer lists and contracts in 2019.
Financing activities used $72,865 of cash in 2020 as compared to $430,919 of cash provided in 2019. Our cash used in financing activities for 2020 related to cash received from the exercise of stock warrants totaling $172,560 offset by $245,425 for the repurchase of stock for taxes withheld. Our cash provided in financing activities in 2019 consisted of cash received from the exercise of employee stock options totaling $430,919.
Liquidity and Sources of Financing
We believe that our available cash on hand, excluding restricted cash, at December 31, 2020 of $7,829,453, along with anticipated revenues and operating profits anticipated for 2021, will be sufficient to sustain our operations for the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Our estimates will be based on our experience and our interpretation of economic, political, regulatory, and other factors that affect our business prospects.
Fixed assets - Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is principally recorded on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally 3 to 10 years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements. Expenditures for property betterments and renewals are capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition of a depreciable asset, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in other income (expense).
The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability.
Intangible assets - For intangible assets, we recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Internally Developed Software Costs - Computer software development costs are expensed as incurred, except for internal use software or website development costs that qualify for capitalization as described below, and include compensation and related expenses, costs of hardware and software, and costs incurred in developing features and functionality.
For computer software developed or obtained for internal use, costs that are incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of software development are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application and development stage are capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a three to five year estimated useful life, beginning in the period in which the software is available for use.
Income taxes - Our income tax expense is comprised of current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their basis as reported in our consolidated financial statements. We also recognize deferred tax assets for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we conclude are more likely-than-not to be realized in the foreseeable future.
We recognize and measure income tax benefits based upon a two-step model: 1) a tax position must be more likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and 2) the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely-than-not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized for a position and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. We accrue income tax related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.
We have filed consolidated tax returns whereby past subsidiary losses are used to offset tax liabilities on current profits. This approach could be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and if not accepted, may affect net income and earnings per share. Management believes that the likelihood of the IRS not accepting such filings is minimal.
Revenue recognition - The Company recognizes revenue when goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining when and how revenue is recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five-step analysis: (i) identification of contract with customers; (ii) determination of performance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligations.
The Company generates revenues from Plasma card programs through fees generated from cardholder fees and interchange fees. Revenues from Pharma card programs are generated through card program management fees, interchange fees, and settlement income.
Plasma and Pharma card program revenues include both fixed and variable components. Our cardholder fees represent an obligation to the cardholder based on a per transaction basis and recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Card program management fees include an obligation to our card program sponsors and are generally recognized when earned on a monthly basis pursuant to the contract terms which are generally multi-year contracts. Interchange fees are earned when customer-issued cards are processed through card payment networks as the nature of our promise to the customer is that we stand ready to process transactions at the customer’s requests on a daily basis over the contract term. Since the timing and quantity of transactions to be processed by us is not determinable, we view interchange fees to comprise an obligation to stand ready to process as many transactions as the customer requests. Accordingly, the promise to stand ready is accounted for as a single series performance obligation. The company uses the right to invoice practical expedient and recognizes revenue concurrent with the processing of card transactions.
Previously, settlement income from Pharma programs was recognized and recorded, after giving consideration to any revenue constraints, ratably throughout the program lifecycle based on the Company’s estimate of the unspent balances to be remaining on the card at program expiration. During 2020, the Company observed substantially different performance indicators, current trends in the industry regarding program management by third parties, and new information available in dollar loads and spending patterns compared to historical experience. As a result, the Company changed its estimate of breakage for recognizing settlement income for Pharma programs resulting in the Company constraining revenue on all Pharma programs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Based on the recently observed change in facts and circumstances, the Company utilizes the remote method of revenue recognition for settlement income whereby the unspent balances will be recognized as revenue at the expiration of the cards and the respective program. The Company records all revenue on a gross basis since it is the primary obligor and establishes the price in the contract arrangement with its customers. The Company is currently under no obligation for refunding any fees, and the Company does not currently have any obligations for disputed claim settlements. Given the nature of the Company’s services and contracts, it has no contract assets.
Cost of revenues is comprised of transaction processing fees, data connectivity and data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production costs, customer service, program management, application integration setup, and sales and commission expense.
Stock-Based Compensation - The Company recognizes compensation expense for all restricted stock and stock option awards. The fair value of restricted stock is measured using the grant date trading price of our stock. The fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period. We have elected to recognize compensation expense for all options with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire option. The determination of fair value using the Black-Scholes pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including expected stock price volatility and the risk-free interest rate.
