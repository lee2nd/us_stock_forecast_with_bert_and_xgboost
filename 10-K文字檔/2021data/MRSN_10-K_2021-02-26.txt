Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, that offer a clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients with significant unmet need. We have leveraged over 20 years of industry learning in the ADC field to develop proprietary and differentiated technology platforms that enable us to design ADCs to have improved efficacy, safety and tolerability relative to existing ADC therapies.
We believe that our innovative platforms which include Dolaflexin and Dolasynthen, delivering our DolaLock payload, as well as Immunosynthen, delivering a novel stimulator of interferon genes, or STING, agonist, compose a highly efficient product engine that has enabled a robust discovery pipeline for us and our partners. Our ADCs in preclinical and clinical studies include first-in-class molecules that target multiple tumor types with high unmet medical need and have exhibited improved safety and efficacy compared to ADCs developed using first-generation technology.
Our goal is to become a leading oncology company by leveraging the potential of our innovative and differentiated ADC technologies and the experience and competencies of our management team to identify, acquire and develop promising ADC product candidates and to commercialize cancer therapeutics that are improvements over existing treatments.
Upifitamab rilsodotin (UpRi, XMT-1536), our first-in-class ADC targeting the sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein NaPi2b, utilizes the Dolaflexin platform to deliver about 10 DolaLock payload molecules per antibody. The NaPi2b antigen is broadly expressed in NSCLC adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer with limited expression in normal tissue. We are actively recruiting and dosing patients with ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma, where a majority of patients express NaPi2b in a Phase 1 clinical trial. We expect to initiate a single-arm registration strategy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, UPLIFT, and a combination dose escalation study, UPGRADE, in ovarian cancer in 2021.
XMT-1592 was created using our Dolasynthen platform and also targets NaPi2b. XMT-1592 comprises the same proprietary NaPi2b antibody and potent auristatin DolaLock payload with controlled bystander effect as UpRi, with the additional features of homogeneous, site-specific bioconjugation and precise DAR. XMT-1592 is in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with ovarian cancer and NSCLC adenocarcinoma.
Our early stage programs include, XMT-1660, a potentially first-in-class B7-H4-targeted DolaLock ADC, as well as XMT-2056, a STING-agonist ADC developed using our novel Immunosynthen platform. Our objective in 2021 is to rapidly progress these candidates through IND-enabling studies and scale up manufacturing activities with third parties. These development candidates provide significant opportunities for development in areas of high unmet need such as breast cancer, NSCLC and ovarian cancer.
In addition, we have established strategic research and development partnerships with Merck KGaA and Asana Biosciences for the development and commercialization of additional ADC product candidates against a limited number of targets selected by our partners based on our Dolaflexin platform. We believe the potential of our ADC technologies, supported by our world class management team and protected by our robust intellectual property portfolio, will allow us to discover and develop life-changing antibody-drug conjugates for patients fighting cancer.
Since inception, our operations have focused on building our platforms, identifying potential product candidates, producing drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies, conducting preclinical and toxicology studies, manufacturing clinical study material and conducting clinical studies, establishing and protecting our intellectual property, staffing our company and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through our strategic partnerships, private placements of our convertible preferred stock and public offerings of our common stock. In April 2020, we sold approximately 10.9 million shares of common stock pursuant to an at-the-market, or the ATM, equity offering program and received net proceeds of $63.0 million. In addition, in June 2020, we sold 9.2 million shares of common stock in a follow-on offering and received net proceeds of $164.0 million.
Since inception, we have incurred significant cumulative operating losses. Our net losses were $88.0 million, $28.2 million and $64.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $280.4 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•continue clinical development activities for our lead product candidates, UpRi and XMT-1592;
•develop a companion or complementary diagnostic for the NaPi2b biomarker;
•complete IND-enabling studies for our preclinical development candidates XMT-2056 and XMT-1660;
•continue activities to discover, validate and develop additional product candidates;
•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
•hire additional research, development and general and administrative personnel.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
We are continuing to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and ongoing clinical and preclinical development, as well as discovery efforts. Mitigation activities to minimize COVID-19-related operation disruptions are ongoing and include:
•In line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we have implemented work from home measures for all non-laboratory employees and have suspended all business travel. We have also prioritized laboratory activities and implemented staggered schedules in the interest of safety and efficiency for laboratory-based employees. We will continue to modify and adapt our measures to align with guidance as the pandemic evolves.
•We are currently enrolling patients at investigational sites in different geographic areas across the United States, Canada and Australia in the UpRi Phase 1 study and within the United States in the XMT-1592 Phase 1 dose escalation study. We are in the process of initiating additional clinical sites both inside and outside the United States to increase enrollment, which could additionally mitigate potential regional impacts from COVID-19. Consistent with FDA guidance, we issued an administrative letter to allow for remote patient monitoring and remote testing, when possible.
•To the best of our knowledge, our contract manufacturing partners continue to operate their manufacturing facilities at or near normal levels, and we have not experienced any COVID-related delays in our manufacturing to date. We believe we have sufficient inventory of UpRi and XMT-1592 to support our ongoing clinical studies. We have planned manufacturing runs to address all currently anticipated future needs. At this time, and subject to further COVID-19 implications, we do not anticipate any disruptions to our clinical supply.
The ultimate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted. While the pandemic did not materially affect our financial results and business operations in the year ended December 31, 2020, we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results in future periods due to numerous uncertainties. Management is actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, operations, suppliers, industry, and our employees. For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, our financial condition or our results of operations, see “Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. All of our revenue has been generated from strategic partnerships.
In June 2014, we entered into an agreement with Merck KGaA for the development and commercialization of ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer for up to six target antigens. Merck KGaA is responsible for generating antibodies against the target antigens and we are responsible for generating Fleximer and our proprietary payloads and conjugating this to the antibody to create the ADC product candidates. Merck KGaA has the exclusive right to and is responsible for the further development and commercialization of these ADC product candidates. In May 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with Merck KGaA for the supply of materials that could be used for IND-enabling studies and clinical trials.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenue of $0.8 million, $2.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to the Merck KGaA agreements.
In January 2016, we entered into collaboration agreements with Takeda for the development and commercialization of XMT-1522, a HER2-targeted ADC, and up to seven ADC product candidates utilizing Fleximer. The Company’s collaboration agreements with Takeda were terminated during the first quarter of 2019. We recognized the remaining deferred revenue of $40.0 million related to the termination of the Takeda agreements in the first quarter of 2019. We do not expect to have any further revenue related to these agreements.
We have provided limited services to Asana BioSciences. We recorded no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, an immaterial amount of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and revenue of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, related to those services. In addition, we recognized revenue of $1.5 million related to a milestone achieved during the third quarter of 2018.
For the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all of our revenue to be generated from our collaboration agreements with Merck KGaA and Asana BioSciences. Given the uncertain nature and timing of clinical development, we cannot predict when or whether we will receive further milestone payments or any royalty payments under these collaborations.
For information about our revenue recognition policy, see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses include our drug discovery efforts, manufacturing, and the development of our product candidates, which consist of:
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense;
•costs of funding research and development performed by third parties that conduct research, preclinical activities, manufacturing and clinical studies on our behalf;
•laboratory supplies;
•facility costs, including rent, depreciation and maintenance expenses; and
•upfront and milestone payments under our third-party licensing agreements.
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of certain activities, such as manufacturing, preclinical and clinical studies, are generally recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations and information provided to us by the third parties with whom we contract.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials and manufacturing costs. We expect that our total future research and development costs will continue to increase over current levels, depending on the progress of our clinical development programs. There are numerous factors associated with the successful development and commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at our current stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control may impact our clinical development programs and plans.
A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis following nomination as a product candidate. We have not historically tracked all of our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects under development. The following table summarizes our external research and development expenses, by program, following nomination as a clinical candidate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. All external research and development expenses not attributable to the UpRi, XMT-1592 and XMT-1522 programs are captured within preclinical and discovery costs. These costs relate to XMT-1592 prior to its designation in early 2020, as well as preclinical development candidates XMT-1660 and XMT-2056, additional earlier discovery stage programs and certain unallocated costs. We terminated the development of XMT-1522 in the first quarter of 2019. Our internal research and development costs are primarily personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation costs, and facility costs, including depreciation, and lab consumables.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As such, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:
•successful completion of preclinical studies and IND-enabling studies;
•successful enrollment in and completion of clinical studies;
•receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
•obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
•commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development, legal operations, information technology and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities, including increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, fees to outside consultants and patent costs, among other expenses.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense is related to the credit facility that we entered into on May 9, 2019 and amended in August 2020, with Silicon Valley Bank. These borrowings bear a floating per annum rate interest, as well as a final payment of 5.5% of the amounts drawn, that is being recorded as interest expense over the term through the maturity date using the effective-interest method. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of the deferred financing costs and the accretion of debt discount relating to the credit facility.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, together with the changes in those items:
Collaboration Revenue
Collaboration revenue was $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $42.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $41.3 million, primarily as a result of the termination of the Takeda agreements and the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue of $40.0 million in early 2019. Additionally, revenue of $2.1 million was recognized in connection with the Merck KGaA Agreement and Merck KGaA Supply Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $0.8 million was recognized as a result of completion of research services associated with a target included in the Merck KGaA Agreement.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense was $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall increase of $12.0 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•an increase of $9.2 million related to manufacturing, clinical and regulatory activities for UpRi;
•an increase of $4.3 million related to employee compensation, primarily due to an increase in headcount supporting the growth of our research and development activities, and the increase in valuation of stock-based awards granted to employees;
•an increase of $1.8 million related to XMT-1592 clinical and regulatory expenses;
•an increase of $1.7 million related to manufacturing for preclinical and discovery stage programs including XMT-1660 and XMT-2056;
•an increase of $1.3 million related to other research services and supplies costs;
•an increase of $1.1 million related to advancement of companion diagnostic development efforts for the NaPi2b biomarker; and
•an increase of $0.4 million related to milestones paid for in-licensed technologies.
These increased costs were partially offset by the following:
•a decrease of $5.2 million related to preclinical development and manufacturing activities for XMT-1592;
•a decrease of $1.7 million related to the development and manufacturing activities for XMT-1522; and
•a decrease of $0.9 million to support partner programs.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue our clinical development UpRi and XMT-1592 and continue to advance our preclinical product candidate pipeline and invest in improvements in our ADC technologies.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense was $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall increase of $4.6 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•an increase of $2.8 million related to consulting and professional fees;
•an increase of $1.3 million related to employee compensation, primarily due to the increase in valuation of stock-based awards granted to employees; and
•an increase of $0.5 million in facility-related costs as a result of the amendment of our lease in March 2020.
We expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities. These increases will likely include legal, auditing and filing fees, additional insurance premiums and general compliance and consulting expenses.
Total Other Income (Expense), Net
Total other income (expense), net was $0.1 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other income consists primarily of interest income on cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. Interest expense was related to our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes in those items:
Collaboration Revenue
Collaboration revenue was $42.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, a increase of $31.5 million, primarily as a result of the termination of the Takeda agreements and the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue of $40.0 million in early 2019. Additionally, revenue of $2.1 million was recognized in connection with the Merck KGaA Agreement and Merck KGaA Supply Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2019. This compares to the revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for support of partner programs with Takeda, Merck KGaA and Asana BioSciences of $9.1 million and recognition of a milestone of $1.5 million achieved upon completion of a GLP toxicology study by Asana BioSciences.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense was $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $59.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The overall decrease of $4.9 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•decrease of $13.5 million related to the development and manufacturing activities for XMT-1522; and
•decrease of $9.0 million related to manufacturing activities for UpRi.
These decreased costs were partially offset by the following:
•increase of approximately $8.3 million related to preclinical development and manufacturing activities for XMT-1592;
•increase of approximately $3.0 million related to UpRi clinical and regulatory expenses;
•increase of approximately $3.0 million related to research efforts to further platform development and evaluate potential product candidates;
•increase of $1.8 million related to employee compensation, including stock-based compensation expense;
•increase of $0.8 million related to advancement of companion diagnostic development efforts for the NaPi2B biomarker; and
•increase of $0.6 million related to a milestone paid upon dosing of the first patient in the expansion cohort of the UpRi clinical trial.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue our clinical development UpRi and XMT-1592 and continue to advance our preclinical product candidate pipeline and invest in improvements in our ADC technologies.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense was $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The overall increase of $0.9 million was primarily attributable to the increase in stock-based compensation expense.
We expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities. These increases will likely include legal, auditing and filing fees, additional insurance premiums and general compliance and consulting expenses.
Total Other Income (Expense), Net
Total other income (expense), net was $2.0 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other income consists primarily of interest income on cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, which increased $0.6 million due to higher investable balances for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense of $0.2 million was related to our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We have financed our operations primarily with the proceeds from our initial public offering, our follow-on public offerings in 2019 and 2020, and use of our at-the-market, or ATM, equity offering program in 2020. Our follow-on public offering was completed on March 5, 2019 and resulted in net proceeds of $92.2 million. On July 2, 2018, we established an ATM, or the 2018 ATM, pursuant to which we were able to offer and sell up to $75.0 million of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices. In April 2020, we sold approximately 10.9 million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $63.0 million pursuant to our 2018 ATM. In addition, in June 2020, we sold 9.2 million shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $164.0 million.
In May 2020, we terminated the 2018 ATM and established a new ATM, or the 2020 ATM, pursuant to which we are able to sell up to $100.0 million of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices. As of December 31, 2020, we had not sold any shares under the 2020 ATM and had $100.0 million of availability under the program.
On May 8, 2019, we entered into a term-loan agreement which was subsequently amended on August 28, 2020. Pursuant to the amendment, we may be subject to certain conditions, borrow term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $30.0 million, of which $5.2 million were funded upon execution of the amendment. These proceeds were used to repay the existing balance and satisfy our existing obligations to Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB. No additional amounts have been drawn since the initial draw of $5.2 million.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $255.1 million.
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and primarily consisted of a net loss of $88.0 million adjusted for changes in our net working capital and other non-cash items including stock-based compensation of $7.2 million and depreciation of $1.0 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of a net loss of $28.2 million adjusted for non-cash items including
stock-based compensation of $4.9 million and depreciation of $1.2 million, as well as change in our net working capital and the decrease in deferred revenue of $41.4 million primarily related to the Takeda agreements. Net cash used in operating activities was $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and primarily consisted of a net loss of $64.3 million adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation of $3.9 million and depreciation of $1.3 million, as well as change in our net working capital and the decrease in deferred revenue of $6.2 million.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $37.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $27.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of maturities of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of maturities of marketable securities.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $230.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $97.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020 cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $164.0 million related to the follow-on public offering in May 2020 and the proceeds from the use of the 2018 ATM of $63.0 million in April 2020 as well as proceeds from exercise of stock options of $3.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019 cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of the proceeds from our follow-on public offering of our common stock and issuance of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2018 cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
Funding Requirements
We expect our cash expenditures to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, initiate clinical studies of, and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators.
We believe our currently available funds will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan commitments for approximately the next two years. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical studies for our product candidates;
•the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;
•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we obtain;
•the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical study costs under future collaboration agreements, if any;
•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical and commercial production; and
•the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical studies is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve drug sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. We currently have access to an additional line of credit under the credit facility with SVB, along with funds to potentially be earned in connection with our agreements with Merck KGaA and Asana BioSciences, if development activities are successful under those agreements. Future additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
If we raise funds through additional strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2020:
__________________________________
(1)Represents future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating and finance leases, which expire through February 2024. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes.
(2)Represents future debt principal plus interest and final payments under our term-loan, which is payable in full on November 1, 2024. Refer to footnote 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with third parties to assist us with preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, and other products and services for operating purpose. Certain of these agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to the parties with whom we contract upon termination, primarily to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation and for wind-down activities. The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2020, we had cancellable open purchase orders of $59.8 million in total under material agreements for preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, and other products and services for operating purposes. These amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay at December 31, 2020, assuming we would not cancel these agreements. The actual amounts we expect to pay in the future to the third parties under such agreements may differ from the cancellable open purchase order amounts.
In July 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Recepta Biopharma S.A., or Recepta, as amended, for the NaPi2b antibody. Under this agreement, we paid Recepta an upfront payment of $1.0 million and are obligated to pay Recepta up to
$65.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered royalties in the low-single digit percentages on net sales of products outside of Brazil until the expiration of the royalty term. Upon the expiration of each royalty term in each country for each applicable product, the exclusive licenses granted to each party under the agreement will become fully-paid up and royalty-free. We have made $1.9 million in development milestone payments to date.
In January 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Synaffix B.V., or Synaffix, to develop, manufacture and commercialize ADC targets using Synaffix’s proprietary technology for a total of six targets. At contract inception we designated the first target and paid an upfront, non-refundable license fee of $0.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we designated the next target and paid an upfront non-refundable reservation fee of $0.3 million. We are required to make milestone payments to Synaffix of up to an aggregate of $24.8 million in development and regulatory milestones, up to $20.0 million in one-time sales milestones based on the achievement of annual sales objectives for the first target. In addition, upon designation of additional targets, we will be obligated to pay in the range of $44.8 million to $62.0 million for issuance, development, regulatory and one time sales milestones. Finally, pursuant to the terms this license agreement, upon commencement of commercial sales of a product, if any, we are required to pay to Synaffix tiered royalties in the low-single digit percentages on net sales of the respective products. We have made $0.8 million in development milestone payments to Synaffix to date.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates
Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.
We believe that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition
We enter into collaboration agreements which are within the scope of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606, under which we license rights to our technology and certain of our product candidates and perform research and development services for third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front fees; reimbursement of research and development costs; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.
Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
The promised good or services in our arrangement typically consist of license rights to our intellectual property and research and development services. We also have optional additional items in contracts, which are considered marketing offers and are accounted for as separate contracts with the customer if such option is elected by the customer, unless the option provides a material right which would not be provided without entering into the contract. Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct
when (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources or (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised good or services are distinct, we consider factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own or whether the required expertise is readily available.
We estimate the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration and at each reporting period, we evaluate the amount of potential payment and the likelihood that the payments will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected amount method to estimate the amount expected to be received based on which method better predicts the amount expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.
Our contracts often include development and regulatory milestone payments. At contract inception and at each reporting period, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is not probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not included in the transaction price. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).
We allocate the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price of the underlying performance obligations or in the case of certain variable consideration to one or more performance obligations. We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs to complete the respective performance obligation. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for each performance obligation.
For performance obligations consisting of licenses and other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.
Collaborative Arrangements
We record the elements of our collaboration agreements that represent joint operating activities in accordance with ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808). Accordingly, the elements of the collaboration agreements that represent activities in which both parties are active participants and to which both parties are exposed to the significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of the activities, are recorded as collaborative arrangements. We consider the guidance in ASC Topic 606 in determining the appropriate treatment for the transactions between us and our collaborative partners and the transactions between us and third parties. Generally, the classification of transactions under the collaborative arrangements is determined based on the nature and contractual terms of the arrangement along with the nature of the operations of the participants. To the extent revenue is generated from a collaboration, we will recognize our share of the net sales on a gross basis if we are deemed to be the principal in the transactions with customers, or on a net basis if we are instead deemed to be the agent in the transactions with customers, consistent with the guidance in Topic 606.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We record our expenses related to research and development activities based upon our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of subjects, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrued or prepaid expense balance accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amounts actually incurred. Significant judgement is, at times, involved in making the above estimates.
