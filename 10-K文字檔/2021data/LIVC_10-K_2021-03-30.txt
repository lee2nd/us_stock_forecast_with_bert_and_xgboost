ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The following selected financial data was derived from the Company's audited and unaudited financial statements. The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this registration statement. In addition, the Company expects to focus its resources on the development of its Gaming business in the near future. This business is significantly different from the domain name and web development business that the Company has historically been engaged in. As a result, historical results and capital requirements are not expected to be reflective of the Company's financial results and capital requirements moving forward.
Summary of Results
Results of Operation
Revenue
The Company recognized a gain of $117,466 from the sale of a domain name during the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $359,200). The Company did not recognize recurring revenues during its 2020 or 2019 fiscal years. The Company continues to market its domain names in its portfolio and considers offers received for domain names in its portfolio. The Company believes its portfolio of domain names will continue to maintain its value over time. The Company does not anticipate earning significant advertising revenue from SPRT MTRX in the 2021 fiscal year.
The Company has an accumulated deficit of $17,737,642 at December 31, 2020. The Company is presently in the development stage of its business and cannot provide any assurances that it will be able to generate regular or recurring revenues in the near future.
Subsequent to its fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed the sale of one of its domain names for $1,150,000.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $283,775 as compared to $343,435 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $59,660. A majority of the change is attributable to the decrease in marketing costs related to the eBalance micro current device, the sale of which the Company has ceased and a decrease in registration costs for domain names that no longer form an integral part of the business going forward.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The Company recorded a net profit of $231,999 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net profit of $15,765 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The difference is the result of two transactions follows: During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company had a gain of $117,466 from the sale of domain names compared to $359,200 in the year ended December 31, 2019. This gain in the year ended 2019 was more than offset by a gain in the year ended 2020 of $398,308 due to the change in the fair value of an equity investment received as part of the sale of the eBalance marketing rights agreement as detailed below and the gain on the sale of the license.
On January 29, 2020, the Company made the decision to exit the medical device distribution business and agreed to sell back to Cell MedX Corp. ("Cell MedX") the exclusive worldwide distribution rights to Cell MedX's eBalance microcurrent device, acquired in 2019 (the "Distribution Rights"). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sold the Distribution Rights back to Cell MedX in consideration for a royalty on future sales of the eBalance device capped at US$507,500, plus warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares in the common stock of Cell MedX (the "Warrants") exercisable for a period of three (3) years. 1,000,000 of the Warrants are exercisable at a price of $US0.50 per share (the "$0.50 Warrants"), with the remaining 1,000,000 Warrants exercisable at US$1.00 per share (the "$1.00 Warrants"). The Warrants are subject to an acceleration right, with the $0.50 Warrants being subject to acceleration if Cell MedX's common stock trades at or above $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, and the $1.00 Warrants being subject to acceleration if Cell MedX's common stock trades at or above $1.75 per share for 30 consecutive trading days.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital surplus of $41,938, compared to $324,145 at December 31, 2019. The Company's only source of cashflow during the year ended December 31, 2020 was through the sale of domain names totaling $117,466. Due to the fact that the Company has incurred recurring losses and anticipates incurring further losses in the future, the Company has determined there is substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company does not believe it has the necessary cash requirements for the next 12 months without having to raise additional funds.
The Company does not anticipate purchasing any plant or significant equipment in the immediate future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to shareholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
