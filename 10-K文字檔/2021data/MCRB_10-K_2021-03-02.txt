Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Summary Risk Factors” and Part I and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a microbiome therapeutics company developing a novel class of live biotherapeutic drugs, which are consortia of microbes designed to treat disease by modulating the microbiome to treat or prevent disease by repairing the function of a disease susceptible microbiome to a non-disease state. We have an advanced drug pipeline with late-stage clinical assets and a differentiated microbiome therapeutics drug discovery and development platform including GMP manufacturing capabilities for this novel drug modality.
Our highest-priority is preparing the SER-109 BLA for submission to the FDA; we are focused on completing acquisition of the required safety database necessary for approval to treat CDI, with SER-109. Additionally, using our microbiome therapeutics platform, we are focusing our resources on obtaining clinical results from our clinical programs in ulcerative colitis, or UC, a form of IBD, with SER-287 and SER-301, with SER-401 in patients with metastatic melanoma and with SER-155 to prevent mortality due to gastrointestinal infections, bacteremia and GvHD in immunocompromised patients, including in patients receiving allo-HSCT or solid organ transplants.
Since our inception in October 2010, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our programs, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
All our product candidates other than SER-109, SER-287, SER-301, SER-155 and SER-401 are still in preclinical development or early stage discovery. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $89.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $548.8 million and cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments totaling $303.4 million. Based on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2020, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12-months from issuance of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In August 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 10,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $21.50 per share. In addition, we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,575,000 shares of our common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, which the underwriters exercised in full. We received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately $243.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
Also, in August 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Société des Produits Nestlé S.A., or Nestlé, for the sale of 959,002 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $20.855 per share, or the “concurrent placement.” We received aggregate net proceeds from the concurrent placement of approximately $19.9 million after deducting offering expenses payable by us. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Impact of Novel Coronavirus
We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a work from home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, and other business partners in light of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the
United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact on financial markets and the global economy, the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine distribution efforts and the effectiveness of other actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations-The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact, our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials, results of operations and financial condition” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SER-109
SER-109 is an oral, purified bacterial spore-based microbiome therapeutic candidate consisting of a consortium of purified bacteria. Our SER-109 manufacturing process includes inactivation and clearance steps designed to eliminate potential pathogens. SER-109 is designed to prevent further recurrences of CDI in patients with a history of multiple infections by modulating the microbiome to a state that resists C. difficile colonization and growth. SER-109, if approved, is intended to treat individuals with recurrent CDI, a patient population which includes approximately 170,000 individuals per year in the United States. We completed enrollment with 182 patients with multiply recurrent CDI in ECOSPOR III. All patients who entered ECOSPOR III must have tested positive for C. difficile toxin, as currently recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines (McDonald Clin Infect Dis 2018). This inclusion criterion was implemented in an effort to ensure enrollment of only patients with active infection rather than simple colonization. The study was designed to evaluate patients for 24 weeks with the primary endpoint of comparing the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing.
In August 2020, we reported positive topline results from the interim analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 ECOSPOR III study evaluating SER-109 for recurrent CDI. Those results showed that SER-109 administration resulted in a highly statistically significant absolute decrease of 30.2% in the proportion of patients who experienced a recurrence in CDI within eight weeks of administration versus placebo, the study’s primary endpoint, and which remained consistent at 12-weeks end point with a 31.1% absolute decrease. At eight weeks of treatment, 11.1% of patients administered SER-109 experienced a CDI recurrence, versus 41.3% of placebo patients. The study results were equally compelling when characterized by the alternative metric of sustained clinical response, where 89% of patients in the SER-109 arm achieved this objective at eight weeks. Subsequent analyses from the completed Phase 3 study using the final statistically defined Intent-to-Treat population show that 12.4% of subjects experienced a recurrence, versus 39.8% on placebo, which represents a relative risk of 0.32 (95% CI 0.18-0.58; p<.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 27.4% and a relative risk reduction of 69%. The percent on SER-109 with a sustained clinical response was approximately 88%. The number-needed-to treat was 3.7. In the same updated analysis, the 12 week rate of recurrence in the SER-109 arm was 18.0%, compared to a rate of 46.2% in the placebo arm, representing an absolute risk reduction of 28% (relative risk 0.40; 95% CI 0.24-0.65; p-value = 0.002), and thereby consistent with the results seen at eight weeks. Results across stratifications of age and antibiotics remained similar. The study’s efficacy results related to the primary endpoint from all analyses exceeded the statistical threshold previously provided in consultation with the FDA that could allow this single clinical study to fulfill efficacy requirements for a biological license application, or BLA. The efficacy remained durable through twenty-four weeks of follow-up.
The SER-109 safety results observed to-date were favorable, with an adverse event profile comparable to placebo. We are actively enrolling patients in our SER-109 open-label study, which also admits patients with a single recurrence of CDI, to expand the safety database to meet the FDA threshold of at least 300 patients.
SER-287
SER-287, an oral, consortium of purified bacteria, is a microbiome therapeutic candidate designed to normalize the gastrointestinal microbiome of individuals with UC. In December 2018, we commenced a three-arm placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial that was designed to evaluate SER-287 in approximately 201 patients with mild-to-moderate UC. Two groups of patients are receiving different doses of SER-287, both following pre-conditioning with a short course of oral vancomycin. A third study arm will receive placebo. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate clinical remission measured after 10 weeks of SER-287 administration. Patients then enter a 2-week exploratory maintenance follow-up period. Endoscopic improvement will be measured as a secondary efficacy measure. Based on feedback from the FDA, if the data from this trial is positive, we expect that the Phase 2b clinical trial could be one of two pivotal trials to enable a BLA to be submitted for SER-287 for the treatment of UC. SER-287 development activity has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
There are approximately 700,000 UC patients in the United States and fewer than one-third of patients on current therapies achieve remission. Approved treatments are often inadequate to control disease activity and are often associated with significant side effects, including immunosuppression. We believe that SER-287 may address underlying drivers of inflammation in UC and, based on the favorable tolerability profile observed in our clinical trials of SER-287, has the potential to be developed as both a foundational monotherapy, as well as a combination therapy with other UC drugs. SER-287 has been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in adult subjects with active mild-to-moderate UC. SER-287 has been designated an Orphan Drug for pediatric UC by the FDA. We anticipate top-line results in mid-2021.
SER-301
We are also advancing our next generation, rationally-designed, fermented microbiome drug discovery and development capabilities, focusing on advancing SER-301, a therapeutic candidate for UC. We have nominated the SER-301 lead candidate. SER-301 is a consortia of bacteria designed using our reverse translational discovery platform that incorporates analysis of microbiome biomarkers from human clinical data and preclinical assessments using human cell-based assays and in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo disease models. SER-301 is designed to reduce induction of pro-inflammatory activity, improve epithelial barrier integrity and TNF-α driven inflammation in IECs, and modulate UC-relevant anti-inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune pathways. SER-301 is being produced by our advanced fermentation, formulation and delivery platforms. It includes strains delivered in spore form, as well as strains fermented in non-spore (vegetative) form and delivered using enterically-protected technology designed to release in the colon.
We have initiated clinical development activities for SER-301, and in November 2020 we enrolled our first patient in the SER-301 Phase 1b study. This initial clinical study of SER-301 is being conducted in Australia and New Zealand. As a result of enrolling the first patient in the clinical study, we received a $10.0 million milestone payment under our collaboration and license agreement, or the License Agreement, with Société des Produits Nestlé S.A., or Nestlé, successor in interest to Nestec, Ltd.
SER-155
We have nominated the SER-155 lead candidate, consortium of cultivated bacteria microbiome drug and are advancing the candidate into clinical development. The rationale for this program is based in part on published clinical evidence from our collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center showing that allo-HSCT patients with decreased diversity of commensal microbes are significantly more likely to die due to infection and/or lethal graft versus host disease, or GvHD. SER-155 is consortia of cultivated bacteria designed using our reverse translational discovery platform to prevent mortality due to gastrointestinal infections, bacteremia and GvHD in immunocompromised patients, including in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) or solid organ transplants. SER-155 lead candidate is designed to decrease infection and translocation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and modulate host immune responses to decrease GvHD. In November 2017, we were awarded a highly competitive grant from CARB-X to support continued preclinical research and early development work for SER-155. In 2019, Seres was awarded additional funding from CARB-X to support clinical development of SER-155, including support through IND filing and Phase 1b evaluation. The 2019 CARB-X grant provides us with an additional $4.8 million of funding for research, manufacture, and IND submission, with potential for an additional $7.0 million for Phase 1b development, upon completion of milestones. We expect to initiate clinical development of SER-155 in the first half of 2021.
While we plan to focus our investment on our highest priority clinical programs in the near-term, our expenses may increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we:
•
complete the clinical development and prepare for commercialization of SER-109 for patients with recurrent CDI;
•
continue the clinical development of SER-287 in our Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of UC;
•
continue the clinical development of SER-301 for the treatment of UC;
•
initiate clinical development of SER-155 for the prevention of mortality due to GvHD in immunocompromised patients, including in patients receiving allo-HSCT;
•
continue the clinical development of SER-401 in our Phase 1b clinical trial for use with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with metastatic melanoma;
•
make strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities;
•
make strategic investments in our research discovery and development platforms and capabilities;
•
maintain and augment our intellectual property portfolio and opportunistically acquire complementary intellectual property;
•
potentially establish a sales and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•
perform our obligations under our agreements with our collaborators;
•
seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; and
•
experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges.
SER-401
SER-401, an oral consortium of purified bacteria is a microbiome therapeutic candidate comprising a bacterial signature similar to that observed in checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy responders. In March 2019, the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1b clinical study with MD Anderson and PICI, to evaluate SER-401’s potential to augment the response of anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The study is designed to enroll 30 patients with metastatic melanoma who are being treated with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients are randomized at a 2-to-1 ratio to either SER-401 or placebo. The study’s primary endpoints are to evaluate safety and tolerability. Its secondary endpoints are to evaluate the correlation of microbiome biomarkers of response to various clinical and immunological outcome measures.
Seres continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on company operations and ongoing clinical development activity, including on the SER-401 Phase 1b study in metastatic melanoma. Mitigation activities to minimize COVID-19-related operation disruptions are ongoing, however, given the severity and evolving nature of the situation, the timing of the SER-401 Phase 1b clinical readout is uncertain.
In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
As a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, the trading prices for our and other biopharmaceutical companies’ stock have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common stock and any such sales may be on unfavorable terms. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations-The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact, our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials, results of operations and financial condition” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.
Intellectual Property
Patent Portfolio
We have an extensive patent portfolio directed to rationally designed ecologies of spores and microbes. The portfolio includes both company-owned patents and applications, and those that we have rights to as licensee. For example, our portfolio includes an option to license foundational intellectual property related to the use of bacteria in combination with checkpoint inhibitors from MD Anderson. The patents and applications included in our portfolio cover both composition of matter and methods (e.g., method of treating). Our intellectual property rights related to SER-109 (C. difficile) and SER-287 (ulcerative colitis) extend through 2033. We plan on continuing to broaden our patent portfolio. Currently, we have 23 active patent application families, which includes 19 nationalized applications, 2 pending at the PCT stage, and 2 pending U.S. provisional applications. To date, we have obtained 14 issued U.S. patents and 2 U.S. patent applications have additionally been allowed.
Regulatory Exclusivity
If we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to receive marketing exclusivity against biosimilar products. For a new biological composition approved by the FDA, a 12-year period of exclusivity in the United States may be obtained. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency awards 10 years of exclusivity for new molecular entities.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
To date we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. Our revenues have been derived primarily from our agreements with our collaborators. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities and general and administrative costs.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third-parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•
the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. All costs associated with the License Agreement with Nestlé, and the Research Agreement with MedImmune are recorded in research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Our primary focus of research and development since inception has been on our microbiome therapeutics platform and the subsequent development of our product candidates. Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, CROs in connection with our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, lab supplies and consumables, and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee-related costs and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under development and, as such, are classified as costs of our microbiome therapeutics platform research, along with external costs directly related to our microbiome therapeutics platform.
The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred on our platform and by product development program for those that have begun clinical development.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we complete our open-label clinical study of SER-109, advance the clinical development of SER-287, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, including SER-301, SER-155 and SER-401 and pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
Our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future if we increase our headcount to support the potential growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also may continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.
Restructuring
In February 2019, we implemented corporate changes to focus our resources on advancing our clinical-stage therapeutic candidates. As a result, we are concentrating on completing our SER-287 Phase 2b study in mild-to-moderate UC patients, expanding the SER-109 safety database to meet the FDA threshold of at least 300 patients, advancing the SER-401 Phase 1b study in collaboration with the PICI and MD Anderson to evaluate augmenting checkpoint inhibitor response in patients with metastatic melanoma, and advancing SER-301 into clinical development. In connection with the prioritization of these therapeutic candidates, we made changes to our management team and reduced headcount by approximately 30 percent.
Other (Expense) Income, Net
Interest (Expense) Income, Net
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Interest expense consists of interest incurred under our loan and security agreement with Hercules.
Other Income
Other income primarily consists of sublease income.
Income Taxes
Since our inception in 2010, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $390.0 million and $386.9 million, respectively, both of which begin to expire in 2035. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $36.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2031 and 2028, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits include an orphan drug credit carryforward of $20.7 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except those contracts that are within the scope of other guidance, such as leases, insurance, and financial instruments. We enter into agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we license certain of our product candidates and perform research and development services in connection with such arrangements. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: nonrefundable up-front fees, reimbursement of research and development costs, development, clinical, regulatory and commercial sales milestone payments, and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. When determining the timing and extent of revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps:
(i)
identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(ii)
identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract;
(iii)
determine the transaction price;
(iv)
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and
(v)
recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services transferred to our customer.
At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract to determine whether each promised good or service is a performance obligation. The promised goods or services in our arrangements typically consist of a license to our intellectual property and/or research and development services. We may provide options to additional items in such arrangements, which are accounted for as separate contracts when our customer elects to exercise such options, unless the option provides a material right to our customer. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to our customer that (i) our customer can benefit from on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Goods or services that are not individually distinct performance obligations are combined with other promised goods or services until such combined group of promises meets the requirements of a performance obligation.
We determine transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration may be fixed, variable, or a combination of both. At contract inception for arrangements that include variable consideration, we estimate the probability and extent of consideration we expect to receive under the contract utilizing either the most likely amount method or expected amount method, whichever best estimates the amount expected to be received. We then consider any constraints on the variable consideration and include in the transaction price variable consideration to the extent it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price and recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) control is transferred to our customer and the performance obligation is satisfied. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
We record amounts as accounts receivable when the right to consideration is deemed unconditional. When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from our customer prior to transferring goods or services to our customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded for deferred revenue.
We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is that the period between payment by our customer and the transfer of the promised goods or services to our customer will be one year or less. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected period over which we would have amortized the asset is one year or less, or the amount is immaterial.
Collaboration Revenue
Arrangements with collaborators may include licenses to intellectual property, research and development services, manufacturing services for clinical and commercial supply, and participation on joint steering committees. We evaluate the promised goods or services to determine which promises, or group of promises, represent performance obligations. In contemplation of whether a promised good or service meets the criteria required of a performance obligation, we consider the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities and expertise of our customer relative to the underlying intellectual property, and whether the promised goods or services are integral to or dependent on other promises in the contract. When accounting for an arrangement that contains multiple performance obligations, we must develop judgmental assumptions, which may include market conditions, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, development timelines and probabilities of regulatory success to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract.
When we conclude that a contract should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation and recognized over time, we must then determine the period over which revenue should be recognized and the method by which to measure revenue. We generally recognize revenue using a cost-based input method.
Licenses of Intellectual Property
If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue allocated to the license when the license is transferred to our customer and our customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue associated with the bundled performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of progress and related revenue recognition.
Milestone Payments
At the inception of each arrangement that includes developmental and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the achievement of each milestone specifically relates to our efforts to satisfy a performance obligation or transfer a distinct good or service within a performance obligation. If the achievement of a milestone is considered a direct result of our efforts to satisfy a performance obligation or transfer a distinct good or service and the receipt of the payment is based upon the achievement of the milestone, the associated milestone value is allocated to that distinct good or service, otherwise it will be allocated to all performance obligations of the arrangement based on the initial allocation.
We evaluate each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price. We first estimate the amount of the milestone payment that we could receive using either the expected value or the most likely amount approach. We primarily use the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, we consider whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty). We update the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances.
Royalties
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any revenue related to sales-based royalties or milestone payments based on the level of sales.
Manufacturing Supply Services
For arrangements that include a promise of supply of clinical or commercial product, we determine if the supply is a promise in the contract or a future obligation at our customer’s option. If determined to be a promise at inception of the contract, we evaluate the promise to determine whether it is a separate performance obligation or a component of a bundled performance obligation. If determined to be an option, we determine if the option provides a material right to our customer and if so, account for the option as a separate performance obligation. If determined to be an option but not a material right, we account for the option as a separate contract when our customer elects to exercise the option.
Application of the above guidance requires significant judgment and requires us to make determinations based on the facts and circumstances under each arrangement.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
CROs in connection with performing research services on our behalf and clinical trials;
•
investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials;
•
vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and
•
vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Revenue
Total revenue was $33.2 million and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 related primarily to $17.2 million associated with our Research Agreement with MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca Inc. The increase of $10.9 million in revenue from our Research Agreement from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 is primarily related to AstraZeneca’s election to terminate the Research Agreement by and in accordance with its terms. As a result of this election and because we no longer had any performance obligations as of December 31, 2020, we recognized all deferred revenue in fiscal 2020. Additionally, we recognized $11.9 million of revenue associated with our license and collaborative agreement with Nestec Ltd., or the License Agreement. This was a $15.3 million decrease from fiscal 2019, which was primarily a result of an increase in our total estimated costs expected to complete our single performance obligation driven by our active enrollment of patients in our open-label study for SER-109 in order to expand the safety database to meet the FDA threshold of at least 300 patients and SER-287 clinical development activity being adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was partially off-set by cumulative catch-up revenue associated with the increase of $10.0 million to the transaction price related to the milestone payment we received from Nestlé for initiating the SER-301 Phase 1b study. Lastly, we recognized $4.2 million of grant revenue in fiscal 2020, which was a $3.1 million increase from fiscal 2019. This is primarily the result of the advancement of our SER-155 research and development activities, which are reimbursable under the terms of the CARB-X grant.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $90.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $10.4 million was due primarily to the following:
•
an increase of $3.7 million in research expenses related to our microbiome therapeutics platform due primarily to an increase of $5.0 million in employee and consultant expenses. This was partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million in facility and supply costs.
•
an increase of $4.7 million in expenses related to our SER-109 program, due primarily to an increase of $1.7 million in contract manufacturing, an increase of $1.3 million in employee and consultant expenses, an increase of $1.0 million in sequencing costs, an increase of $1.0 million in facilities and supply costs, and partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in clinical trial consulting expenses;
•
a decrease of $1.1 million in expenses of our SER-287 program primarily driven by a decrease in contract manufacturing of $3.4 million, and partially offset by an increase of $1.2 million in facility and supplies, an increase of $0.7 million in clinical trial consulting expenses, and an increase of $0.3 million employee and consultant expenses;
•
an increase of $3.2 million in expenses of our early stage programs primarily driven by an increase in clinical trials costs.
We expect that our research and development expenses may increase in the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of SER-109, SER-287 and SER-301, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, including SER-155 and SER-401, and pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $6.0 million was primarily due to the following:
•
an increase in personnel related costs of $1.5 million primarily due to the increase of $0.8 million in salary cost, payroll tax expense, and benefit costs, and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; and
•
an increase in professional fees of $4.5 million primarily due to a $4.1 million increase in SER-109 commercial readiness and a $0.6 million increase in recruiting fees.
Restructuring
During the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded charges of $1.5 million related to severance and other termination benefits, of which $1.3 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2019. The remaining $0.2 million of restructuring charges were paid in fiscal 2020. No restructuring charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2020.
Other (Expense) Income, Net
Other (expense) income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.0 million of expense, compared to $1.6 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $2.6 million decrease in other (expense) income, net was primarily due to $2.9 million of interest expense associated with our term loan with Hercules, associated with the term loan being outstanding for the entirety of fiscal 2020 compared to partially outstanding in fiscal 2019.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Revenue
Total revenue was $34.5 million and $28.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The revenue for both periods principally relates to the recognition of amounts received under the License Agreement. The increase is mainly due to recognition of amounts received under the Research Agreement entered into in March 2019.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $15.8 million was due primarily to the following:
•
a decrease of $8.8 million in research expenses related to our microbiome therapeutics platform, due primarily to a decrease of $9.3 million in employee and consultant expenses, and partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million of professional fees and an increase of $0.2 million of facility and supply costs;
•
a decrease of $8.2 million in expenses related to our SER-109 program, due primarily to a decrease of $3.2 million in contract manufacturing costs, a $3.1 million decrease in clinical trial consulting expenses, a $1.0 million decrease in facility and supply costs, and a decrease of $0.9 million in sequencing costs;
•
an increase of $5.8 million in expenses of our SER-287 program primarily driven by an increase in clinical trials costs of $4.8 million, an increase in contract manufacturing of $3.4 million, this is partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in facility and supply costs, and a $0.8 million decrease sequencing and a $0.4 million decrease in employee and consultant expenses, and;
•
a decrease of $4.6 million in expenses of our early stage programs primarily driven by a decrease in clinical trial costs of $2.8 million and decrease in sequencing costs $1.0 million.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $7.8 million was primarily due to the following:
•
a decrease in personnel related costs of $6.2 million primarily due to the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $4.6 million and a decrease in salary costs of $1.8 million;
•
an increase in professional fees of $1.7 million primarily due to an increase in consulting fees of $0.7 million, an increase in accounting related fees of $0.7 million, and an increase in legal fees of $0.3 million; and
•
a decrease in facility-related and other costs of $3.3 million primarily due to a decrease in information technology expenses.
Restructuring
During the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded charges of $1.5 million related to severance and other termination benefits, of which $1.3 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2019. No restructuring charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million, compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.3 million increase in other income, net was primarily due to sublease income of $0.9 million. This increase was partially offset by interest expense of $0.5 million incurred under the Term Loan Facility.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have generated revenue only from collaborations and have incurred recurring net losses. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years. Our research and development and general and administrative expenses may continue to increase and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional financings, public offerings, research funding, additional collaborations, contract and grant revenue or other sources.
In August 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 10,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $21.50 per share. In addition, we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,575,000 shares of its common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, which the underwriters exercised in full. We received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately $243.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
In August 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Nestlé for the sale of 959,002 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $20.855 per share (the “concurrent placement”). We received aggregate net proceeds from the concurrent placement of approximately $19.9 million after deducting offering expenses payable by us.
In November 2019, we entered into a common stock sales agreement, or the 2019 Sales Agreement, with Cowen to sell shares of our common stock with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $25.0 million, from time to time, through an ATM under which Cowen acts as sales agent. In March 2020, in connection with filing an updated registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-237033), we entered into a new common stock sales agreement, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, with Cowen on substantially the same terms as the 2019 Sales Agreement and terminated the 2019 Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock under the 2019 Sales Agreement and the 2020 Sales Agreement, as applicable, at an average price of approximately $4.40 per share, raising aggregate net proceeds of approximately $24.8 million after deducting an aggregate commission of approximately 3%.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments totaling $303.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $548.8 million. Based on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2020, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12-months from issuance of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.
Collaboration Agreements
Agreement with Nestlé
In January 2016, we entered into the License Agreement, for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates in development for the treatment and management of CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn’s disease. In exchange for the license, Nestlé agreed to pay us an upfront cash payment of $120.0 million, which we received in February 2016. Nestlé has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to high teens, of net sales of certain products based on our microbiome technology that are being developed for the treatment of CDI and IBD, including SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-301, or collectively, the Nestlé Collaboration Products in markets outside of the United States and Canada, or the Licensed Territory. We have retained full commercial rights to the Nestlé Collaboration Products with respect to the United States and Canada, where we plan to build our own commercial organization. We are eligible to receive up to $285.0 million in development milestone payments, $375.0 million in regulatory payments and up to an aggregate of $1.1 billion for the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the sales of Nestlé Collaboration Products. The full potential value of the up-front payment and milestone payments payable by Nestlé is over $1.9 billion, assuming all products receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. In September 2016, we received a $10.0 million milestone payment associated with the initiation of the Phase 1b clinical study for SER-262 in CDI. In June 2017, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical study of SER-109 (ECOSPOR III) in patients with multiply recurrent CDI. In July 2017, we recorded revenue of $20.0 million based on the achievement of this milestone under the License Agreement. In November 2018, we executed a letter agreement with Nestlé, or the Letter Agreement, modifying certain terms of the License Agreement. Under the Letter Agreement, Nestlé agreed to pay us the $20.0 million Phase 3 milestone payment upon commencement of the Phase 2b study for SER-287. In December 2018, we received $40.0 million in milestone payments in connection with the commencement of the Phase 2b study for SER-287. To date, we have received $80.0 million in development milestones under the License Agreement with Nestlé.
For the development of Nestlé Collaboration Products for IBD under a global development plan, we agreed to pay the costs of clinical trials of such products up to and including Phase 2 clinical trials, and 67% of the costs for Phase 3 and other clinical trials of such products, with Nestlé bearing the remaining 33% of such costs. The Letter Agreement also provides scenarios under which Nestlé’s reimbursement to us for certain Phase 3 development costs would be reduced or delayed depending on the outcomes of the SER-287 Phase 2b study. For other clinical development of Nestlé Collaboration Products for IBD, we agreed to pay the costs of such activities to support approval in the United States and Canada, and Nestlé agreed to bear the cost of such activities to support approval of Nestlé Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory.
With respect to development of Nestlé Collaboration Products for CDI under a global development plan, we agreed to pay all costs of Phase 2 clinical trials for SER-109 and for Phase 3 clinical trials for SER-109. We agreed to bear all costs of conducting any Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials under a global development plan for Nestlé Collaboration Products other than SER-109 for CDI. We agreed to pay 67% and Nestlé agreed to pay 33% of other costs of Phase 3 clinical trials conducted for Nestlé Collaboration Products other than SER-109 for CDI under a global development plan. For other clinical development of Nestlé Collaboration Products for CDI, we agreed to pay costs of such development activities to support approval in the United States and Canada, and Nestlé agreed to bear the cost of such activities to support approval of Nestlé Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory.
Agreement with AstraZeneca
In March 2019, we entered into the Research Agreement with MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca. Pursuant to the Research Agreement, we and AstraZeneca agreed to conduct certain pre-clinical and development activities and may conduct certain clinical research with the goal of advancing the mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in augmenting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, including potential synergy with AstraZeneca compounds in accordance with a mutually agreed research plan. Pursuant to the Research Agreement, we agreed not to conduct research or development of any microbiome products specifically designed by us during the term of the Research Agreement for the treatment of cancer with or on behalf of any third party without the prior approval of the joint steering committee for the Research Agreement until at least three years after the effective date of the Research Agreement.
AstraZeneca has agreed to bear all costs of conducting its activities under the research plan and to reimburse us for certain costs incurred under the research plan. Additionally, AstraZeneca has agreed to pay to us a total of $20.0 million in three equal installments, the first of which we received in April 2019, the second of which we received in December 2019, and the third of which will become due on January 4, 2021. Such payments are payable even if the Research Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, unless the Research Agreement is terminated by AstraZeneca for our uncured material breach.
We also granted AstraZeneca an exclusive option to negotiate exclusive license rights to certain of our technologies and assets. If AstraZeneca exercises this option, we have agreed to enter into good faith negotiations with them for terms and conditions of such license agreement for a specified time period.
In December 2020, we received written notice from AstraZeneca that they elected to terminate the Research Agreement by and in accordance with its terms. The termination of the Research Agreement will be effective on April 2, 2021 (the “Termination Date”), which is 120 days from the date of the notice. We received the third and final $6.7 million installment of the aggregate $20.0 million upfront payment due under the Research Agreement in January 2021.
Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules
In October 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules, pursuant to which a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million, or the Term Loan Facility, was available to us in three tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions. We received the first tranche of $25.0 million upon signing the agreement on October 29, 2019. We did not meet the milestone requirements for the second tranche under the Term Loan Facility, and as such, the additional second tranche amount of up to $12.5 million is not available for us to borrow. The third tranche, which allows us to borrow an additional $12.5 million, will be available upon Hercules’ approval on or prior to June 30, 2021.
Advances under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of either (i) the Prime Rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) plus 4.40%, and (ii) 9.65%. We will make interest only payments through December 1, 2021, or extended to June 1, 2022 upon satisfaction of certain milestones, and will then repay the principal balance and interest of the advances in equal monthly installments after the interest only period and continuing through November 1, 2023. We paid Hercules a commitment fee of $0.4 million at the closing. We may prepay advances under the loan and security agreement with Hercules, in whole or in part, at any time subject to a prepayment charge equal to: (a) 3.0 % of amounts so prepaid, if such prepayment occurs during the first year; (b) 2.0% of the amount so prepaid, if such prepayment occurs during the second year, and (c) 1.0% of the amount so prepaid, if such prepayment occurs after the second year. Upon prepayment or repayment of all or any of the term loans, we will pay (in addition to the prepayment premium) an end of term charge of 4.85% of the aggregate funded amount under the Term Loan Facility.
The Term Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property. We have agreed to not pledge or secure our intellectual property to others.
The Term Loan Facility includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, making changes to the nature of our business, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, engaging in transactions with affiliates, creating liens and selling assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions, including, among others, the ability for us to issue up to $150.0 million in convertible notes and entering into exclusive outbound licenses for our intellectual property. The Term Loan Facility also includes a liquidity covenant that commences either October 31, 2020, or December 31, 2020 based upon our satisfying certain performance milestones. If our market capitalization exceeds $350.0 million, we do not have to comply with the liquidity covenant if such covenant is required.
The Term Loan Facility also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuance of which provide Hercules with the right to demand immediate repayment of all principal and unpaid interest, and to exercise remedies against us and the collateral. These events of default include, among other things and subject to customary exceptions: (i) insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar events; (ii) failure to pay any debts due under the loan and security agreement with Hercules or other loan documents on a timely basis; (iii) failure to observe certain covenants under the loan and security agreement with Hercules; (v) occurrence of a material adverse effect; (vi) material misrepresentation by us; (vii) occurrence of any default under any other agreement involving material indebtedness; and (viii) certain material money judgments.
On April 16, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the loan and security agreement with Hercules, permitting us to enter into a promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Stability Act. On April 17, 2020 we issued a Promissory Note to Bank of America, NA, pursuant to which we received loan proceeds of $2.9 million (the “Loan”), however, based on updated guidance related to this program, we decided to repay the full amount of the Loan, and repaid the Loan on May 4, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal under the Term Loan Facility was $25.0 million and $24.6 million, respectively. For a further description of the Term Loan Facility, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $93.6 million of cash, primarily due to a net loss of $89.1 million and by cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $23.2 million and partially offset by non-cash charges of $18.7 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of a $11.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.5 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $1.2 million decrease in accounts payable, a $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable, a $2.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and offset by a $3.8 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The decrease in deferred revenue is due to recognition of revenue during the year and partially offset by $10.0 million associated with the increase in the transaction price for the License Agreement for the initiation of the Phase 1b study for SER-301. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due to the cash payment of lease obligations.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $76.5 million of cash, primarily due to a net loss of $70.3 million and by cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $24.6 million and partially offset by non-cash charges of $18.4 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of a $17.5 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $2.9 million decrease in accrued
expenses and other liabilities, a $1.8 million increase in accounts receivable and offset in part by a $3.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The decrease in deferred revenue is due to recognition of revenue during the year and partially offset by the receipt of $15.0 million of payments from AstraZeneca under the Research Agreement. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due to the cash payment of lease obligations.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, operating activities used $62.9 million of cash, primarily due to a net loss of $98.9 million and partially offset by cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $11.8 million and non-cash charges of $24.3 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a $13.5 million increase in deferred revenue, a $0.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset in part by a $2.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in deferred revenue is due to the receipt of the $40 million milestone payments under the License Agreement offset by recognition of collaboration revenue during the year. The increase in accrued expenses was due to the timing of payments.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, investing activities used $158.9 million of cash, consisting of purchases of investments of $218.3 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $0.6 million; these amounts were partially offset by sales and maturities of investments of $60.0 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, investing activities used $30.5 million of cash, consisting of purchases of investments of $46.4 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $1.0 million; these amounts were partially offset by sales and maturities of investments of $16.9 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, investing activities provided $112.3 million of cash, consisting of sales and maturities of investments of $136.1 million; these amounts were partially offset by purchases of investments of $21.8 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $1.9 million.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $303.4 million. This was a result of $243.7 million from proceeds from public offering of common stock, net of costs, $19.9 million of proceeds from the Securities Purchase Agreement, $24.8 million of proceeds from the at market equity offering, net of commissions, and $14.4 million from the exercise of stock options.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $86.2 million in connection with $60.5 million of proceeds from the public offering of common stock, net of costs, $25.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt, $0.5 million from the issuance of common stock under at the market sales agreement, $0.3 million received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, $0.2 million from the issuance of restricted common stock, and $0.1 million from the issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options. These were partially offset by payments for debt issuance costs of $0.4 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.3 million in connection with $0.3 million received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and $0.2 million from the issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options. These were partially offset by payments for employee tax obligations relating to vesting of restricted stock units of $0.2 million.
Funding Requirements
Our expenses may increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities related to our pipeline products, which are in clinical development, and our follow-on therapeutic candidates and other programs. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•
complete the clinical development and prepare for commercialization of SER-109 for patients with recurrent CDI;
•
continue the clinical development of SER-287 in our Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of UC;
•
continue the clinical development of SER-301 for the treatment of UC;
•
conduct research and initiate clinical development of SER-155 for the prevention of mortality due to GvHD in immunocompromised patients, including in patients receiving all-HSCT;
•
continue the clinical development of SER-401 in our Phase 1b clinical trial for use with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with metastatic melanoma;
•
make strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities;
•
make strategic investments in our research discovery and development platforms and capabilities;
•
maintain and augment our intellectual property portfolio and opportunistically acquire complementary intellectual property;
•
potentially establish a sales and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•
perform our obligations under our agreements with our collaborators;
•
seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; and
•
experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our programs, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the progress and results of our clinical studies and pre-clinical development;
•
the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies of our product candidates;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates and research activities;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;
•
the effect of competing technological and market developments; and
•
the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders’ ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our shareholders’ rights as common stockholders. Our loan and security agreement with Hercules currently includes, and any additional debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Additional debt or preferred equity financing may also require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, in addition to our existing collaboration agreements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
As noted above, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our liquidity and future funding requirements is uncertain as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as this continues to evolve globally. See “Impact of Novel Coronavirus” above and “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations-The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact, our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials, results of operations and financial condition” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. We expect our cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments at December 31, 2020 of $303.4 million will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12-months from issuance of the financial statements.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:
(1)
Amounts in the table reflect payments due under our operating lease agreements that expire between May 2021 and November 2023.
(2)
Amounts in the table reflect payments due for our term loan under an arrangement with Hercules for $25,000. The amounts in the table above reflect interest-only payments through December 1, 2021 with payments on principal beginning thereafter. For purposes of the table above, interest payments were calculated using an annual interest rate of 9.65%, which was the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, the table above includes a payment due upon maturity of the loan of $1,213. See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Hercules term loan.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials, preclinical research studies and testing, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination upon notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
