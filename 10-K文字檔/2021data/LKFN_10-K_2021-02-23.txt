ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Net income in 2020 was $84.3 million, down 3.1% from $87.0 million in 2019 and up 4.9% from $80.4 million in 2018.
Diluted net income per common share was $3.30 in 2020, $3.38 in 2019 and $3.13 in 2018. Return on average total assets was 1.55% in 2020 versus 1.76% in 2019 and 1.69% in 2018. Return on average total equity was 13.51% in 2020 versus 15.47% in 2019 and 16.51% in 2018. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to diluted earnings per share, was 36.36% in 2020, 34.32% in 2019 and 31.95% in 2018. The average equity to average assets ratio was 11.51% in 2020 compared to 11.38% in 2019 and 10.24% in 2018.
Net income in 2020 was positively impacted by an $8.0 million increase in net interest income and a $1.8 million increase in noninterest income. Offsetting these positive impacts were an $11.5 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a $1.8 million increase in noninterest expense.
Net income in 2019 was $87.0 million, up 8.3% from $80.4 million in 2018 and up 51.8% from $57.3 million in 2017. Diluted net income per common share was $3.38 in 2019, $3.13 in 2018 and $2.23 in 2017. Return on average total assets was 1.76% in 2019 versus 1.69% in 2018 and 1.29% in 2017. Return on average total equity was 15.47% in 2019 versus 16.51% in 2018 and 12.72% in 2017. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to diluted earnings per share, was 34.32% in 2019, 31.95% in 2018 and 38.12% in 2017. The average equity to average assets ratio was 11.38% in 2019 compared to 10.24% in 2018 and 10.15% in 2017.
Net income in 2019 was positively impacted by a $4.7 million increase in noninterest income, a $3.8 million increase in net interest income and a $3.2 million decrease in the provision for loan losses. Offsetting these positive impacts was a $3.2 million increase in noninterest expense.
Total assets were $5.830 billion as of December 31, 2020 versus $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $883.7 million or 17.9%. This increase was primarily due to a $572.6 million increase in net loans, an increase in short-term investments of $144.7 million and a $126.6 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities. Total average assets increased $482.9 million primarily due to average loans increasing $449.9 million in 2020, and a $30.4 million increase in available-for-sale investment securities.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation and other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principal is uncollectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans, although the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged against the allowance. A provision for loan losses is taken based on management’s ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance. A formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted monthly. The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the Company’s control.
The level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio, emerging market risk, emerging concentration risk, commercial loan focus and large credit concentration, new industry lending activity, general economic conditions and historical loss analysis. In addition, management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision. Furthermore, management’s overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision.
The determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates by management. The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors: changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers’ ability to repay. Consideration is not limited to these factors although they represent the most commonly cited factors. With respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits, management considers the current valuation of collateral and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows as the primary measures. Management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits. With respect to pools of similar loans, allocations are assigned based upon historical experience subject to a floor, unless the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical losses as noted below. A detailed analysis is performed on loans that are classified but determined not to be impaired which incorporates different scenarios where the risk that the borrower will be unable or unwilling to repay its debt in full or on time is combined with an estimate of loss in the event the borrower cannot pay to develop non-specific allocations for such loan pools. These allocations may be adjusted based on the other factors cited above. An appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined by portfolio segment using historical loss percentages subject to a floor, supplemented with other environmental factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of, and trends in, delinquencies and impaired loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedure, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. It is also possible that the following could affect the overall process: social, political, economic and terrorist events or activities. All of these factors are susceptible to change, which may be significant. As a result of this detailed process, the allowance results in two forms of allocations, specific and general. These two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
Commercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration function. These grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a consensus is reached by credit administration and the loan review officer. Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that indicate the loan is impaired. Considerations with respect to specific allocations for these individual credits include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) does the customer’s cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan; (b) is there adequate collateral to repay the loan; (c) has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination; (d) is the loan impaired; (e) are there other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question; or (f) are there unique loan characteristics that require special monitoring.
Allocations are also applied to categories of loans considered not to be individually impaired, but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages. Such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values. In addition, general allocations are made for other pools of loans, including non-classified loans. These general pooled loan allocations are performed for portfolio segments of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and multi-family, agri-business and agricultural, other commercial, consumer 1-4 family mortgage and other consumer loans, and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss. General allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a three-year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios, subject to a floor, and are adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends.
Due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses, the Company’s allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component. The unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the Company’s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations, including factors such as the level of classified credits, economic uncertainties, industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments, broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the Company’s large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers.
Valuation and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Available-for-Sale Investment Securities
The fair values of securities available-for-sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models, which utilize significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing. This is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value. The fair value of certain securities is determined using unobservable inputs, primarily observable inputs of similar securities.
At the end of each reporting period, securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. Impairment is other-than-temporary if the decline in the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security will not be received.
Significant judgments are required in determining impairment, which includes making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates.
We consider the following factors when determining other-than-temporary impairment for a security or investment:
● the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost;
● the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;
● the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and
● our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
The assessment of whether a decline exists that is other-than-temporary, involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. If, in management’s judgment, other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down to the computed net present value, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings (as if the loss had been realized in the period of other-than-temporary impairment).
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
In 2020 and 2019, the Company continued to grow loans and deposits organically, in its geographic footprint of northern Indiana and in central Indiana in the Indianapolis market. In addition, during 2020 the Company was an active participant in the PPP. The Company had 50 branches as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s profitability has been positively impacted by growth in loans and deposits. In addition, asset quality has remained stable. The core banking contributions to noninterest income of interest rate swap, mortgage banking, loan and wealth management fee income increased in 2020. Overall, expense growth has reflected our continued investment in people, technology and our branch infrastructure. The outlook for 2021 includes plans for continued organic loan and deposit growth, a disciplined credit philosophy, continued investment in the Company in the form of staff additions, continued expansion in our geographic footprint, and continued investments in customer- facing technology and cybersecurity risk management tools.
Selected income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table.
(1) Noninterest expense/Net interest income plus Noninterest income.
(2) Non-GAAP financial measure. Additionally, these non-GAAP measures are used by management for planning and forecasting purposes, including measures based on “tangible common equity” which is “total equity” excluding intangible assets, net of deferred tax, and “tangible assets” which is “total assets” excluding intangible assets, net of deferred tax . See reconciliation below.
(3) Non-GAAP financial measure. Calculated by subtracting the impact PPP loans had on average earnings assets, loan interest income, average interest bearing liabilities, and interest expense. Management believes this is an important measure because it provide for better comparability to prior periods, given the expectation that PPP represents a limited governmental intervention in the lending market, designed to support small businesses through the pandemic, its low fixed interest rate of 1.0% and because the accretion of net loan fee income can be accelerated upon borrower forgiveness and repayment by the SBA. Management is actively monitoring net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis with and without PPP loan impact for the duration of this program. See reconciliation on the next page.
(4) Non-GAAP financial measure. Pretax pre-provision earnings is calculated by adding net interest income to noninterest income and subtracting noninterest expense. Management believes this is an important measure because it may enable investors to identify the trends in the Company's earnings exclusive of the effects of tax and provision expense, which may vary significantly from period to period. See reconciliation below.
The Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful to understanding the company's financial performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per share data).
The impact of the Paycheck Protection Program on Net Interest Margin FTE is provided below (dollars in thousands)
Net Income
Net income was $84.3 million in 2020, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 3.1%, versus net income of $87.0 million in 2019. The decrease in net income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses of $11.5 million, or 356.6%, as well as an increase of $1.8 million, or 2.0%, in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $8.0 million, or 5.1%, and noninterest income increased $1.8 million, or 4.1%. Net interest income for 2020 included $12.8 million in PPP interest and fee income. And unamortized PPP fee income was $6.3 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in provision for loan losses was driven by the potential negative impact to the Company’s borrowers due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net income was $87.0 million in 2019, an increase of $6.6 million, or 8.3%, versus net income of $80.4 million in 2018. The increase in net income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to the increase in noninterest income of $4.7 million, or 11.6%. In addition, net interest income increased $3.8 million, or 2.5%, to $155.0 million versus $151.3 million in 2018 and the provision for loan losses decreased $3.2 million, or 49.5%. Noninterest expense increased by $3.2 million, or 3.7% and income tax expense increased $1.8 million, or 9.7%.
Net Interest Income
The following table presents a three-year average balance sheet and, for each major asset and liability category, its related interest income and yield or its expense and rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
THREE YEAR AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET AND NET INTEREST ANALYSIS
(1) Tax exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 21 percent tax rate. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (“TEFRA”) adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expenses. Taxable equivalent basis adjustments were $2.4 million, $2.1 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(2) Loan fees are included as taxable loan interest income. Net loan fees attributable to PPP loans were $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. All other loan fees were immaterial in relation to total taxable loan interest income for the periods presented.
(3) Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balance of taxable loans.
The following table shows fluctuations in net interest income attributable to changes in the average balances of assets and liabilities and the yields earned or rates paid for the years ended December 31.
NET INTEREST INCOME - RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS (fully tax equivalent basis, dollars in thousands)
(1) The earning assets and interest bearing liabilities used to calculate interest differentials are based on average daily balances for 2020, 2019 and 2018. The changes in net interest income are created by changes in interest rates and changes in the volumes of loans, investments, deposits and borrowings. In the table above, changes attributable to volume are computed using the change in volume from the prior year multiplied by the previous year’s rate, and changes attributable to rate are computed using the change in rate from the prior year multiplied by the previous year’s volume. The change in interest or expense due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
(2) Tax exempt income was converted to a fully taxable equivalent basis at a 21 percent tax rate. The tax equivalent rate for tax exempt loans and tax exempt securities acquired after January 1, 1983 included the TEFRA adjustment applicable to nondeductible interest expense.
Net interest income increased by $8.0 million to $163.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a $528.1 million, or 11.3%, increase in average earning assets, driven by a $469.0 million increase in average commercial loans. The yield on average earning assets decreased 90 basis points to 3.77% in 2020 from 4.67% in 2019. The growth in average commercial loans was driven by $376.8 million in average PPP loans. Average core loan growth, with excludes PPP loans, was $73.2 million, or 1.8%. The net interest margin decreased to 3.19% in 2020 versus 3.38% in 2019, driven by the Federal Reserve Bank decreasing the target Federal Funds Rate by 225 basis points since the second half of 2019, inclusive of two emergency cuts during March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The net interest margin decreased to 3.38% in 2019 versus 3.43% in 2018, due to higher costs on average interest bearing liabilities, which offset an increase in the yield of earning assets during 2019.
Growth in the commercial loan portfolio accounted for most of the growth in loans, as well as total earning assets, during both 2020 and 2019 and positively impacted total interest income. Management believes that the growth in the loan portfolio unrelated to the PPP loan program will likely continue in a measured and prudent fashion as a result of our continued strategic focus on commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending. Loan growth, excluding PPP loans, was slower in 2020 and 2019 as compared to prior years due to a slowdown in demand for manufacturing and industrial loans. The utilization of commercial lines of credit has dropped in 2020 and 2019 due to softened loan demand to 43% at December 31, 2020 from 46% at December 31, 2019 and 49% at December 31, 2018. Management believes its organic growth strategy of continued expansion in its current geographic footprint and in Indianapolis will provide continued loan growth opportunities. During 2020 growth in average loans of $449.9 million, growth in available-for-sale investment securities of $30.4 million and growth in short-term investments and interest bearing deposits of $47.8 was funded through an increase in deposits. Average demand deposits increased $365.8 million in 2020 and average interest bearing deposit accounts increased $42.3 million. The increase in deposits for 2020 resulted from excess liquidity on our customers’ balance sheets resulting from a combination of PPP loans, stimulus payments and an increase in the savings rate as a result from the health crisis and economic downturn.
The Company’s net interest margin decreased 19 basis points to 3.19% for 2020 compared to 3.38% for 2019. The lower margin in 2020 was impacted by lower yields on loans and securities, partially offset by a lower cost of funds. The Federal Reserve Bank decreased the target Federal Funds Rate by 225 basis points since the second half of 2019, including two Federal Reserve Bank emergency cuts to the Federal Funds Rate during March 2020. The two emergency cuts in March reduced the Federal Funds Rate by 150 basis points and brought the Federal Funds Rate back to the zero-bound range of 0.00% to 0.25%.
Provision for Loan Losses
On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. This law extended relief for troubled debt restructurings and provided the opportunity to further delay CECL adoption originally provided under the CARES Act. The Company elected to defer adoption of CECL until January 1, 2021. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $14.8 million in 2020 compared to $3.2 million in 2019 and $6.4 million in 2018. The higher provision in 2020 was driven by the potential negative impact to the company’s borrowers as a result of the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020 was $61.4 million compared to $50.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and $48.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses represented 1.32% of total loans as of December 31, 2020 versus 1.25% at December 31, 2019 and 1.24% at December 31, 2018. The company’s loan loss reserve to total loans excluding PPP loans was 1.45% at December 31, 2020. PPP loans are guaranteed by the United States SBA and have not been allocated for within the allowance for loan losses. Net charge-offs of $4.0 million, or 0.09% of average loans, and net charge-offs of $1.0 million, or 0.03% of average loans, were recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels, asset quality, economic conditions including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans.
Noninterest Income
The following table presents changes in the components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31.
Noninterest income was $46.8 million in 2020 versus $45.0 million in 2019, an increase of $1.8 million, or 4.1%. The increase was primarily driven by a $3.4 million increase in interest rate swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions, as well as a $2.3 million increase in mortgage banking income. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by increases in wealth advisory fees due to continued growth of client relationships. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts driven primarily by lower treasury management fees as well as reduced levels of overdraft fee income.
Noninterest income was $45.0 million in 2019 versus $40.3 million in 2018, an increase of $4.7 million, or 11.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.0 million increase in other income related to $1.2 million of swap fees generated from commercial lending transactions, as well as $846,000 in life insurance proceeds on bank owned life insurance policies. Noninterest income was also positively impacted by increases in bank owned life insurance income, loan and service fees, mortgage banking income, and wealth advisory and brokerage fees due to continued growth of client relationships. Offsetting the increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts driven by lower treasury management fees from a single commercial treasury management relationship. This relationship contributed $4.5 million to services charges on deposit accounts during 2019. The related treasury management activity was terminated and the revenue will not recur in future periods.
Noninterest Expense
The following table presents changes in the components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31.
Noninterest expense was $91.2 million in 2020 versus $89.4 million in 2019, an increase of $1.8 million, or 2.0%. Data processing fees increased $1.5 million in 2020 primarily due to the Company’s continued investment in customer focused, technology-based solutions and ongoing cybersecurity and data management enhancements. FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased $1.1 million due to the expiration of insurance assessment credits. Professional fees increased by $670,000 primarily due to higher legal expenses, increased fees to accounting firms and professional fees for innovative project implementations. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to an increase in staffing in revenue producing and risk management areas as well as higher health insurance expenses. Offsetting these increases were decreases in corporate and business development as the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation and postponement of events, in-person trainings and face-to-face customer and prospect meetings due to COVID-19 safety protocols. The Company spent approximately $640,000 since the pandemic began on personal protective equipment, protective barriers and enhanced social distancing measures for the safety of bank customers and employees.
Noninterest expense was $89.4 million in 2019 versus $86.2 million in 2018, an increase of $3.2 million, or 3.7%. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.1 million primarily due to an increase in staffing in revenue producing and risk management areas as well as normal merit increases. Professional fees increased due to higher legal expenses and increased utilization of accounting firms for outsourced services. Data processing fees also increased during 2019 primarily due to the Company’s continued investment in customer focused, technology-based solutions and ongoing cybersecurity and data management enhancements. Offsetting these increases were decreases in FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees as well as decreases in corporate and business development. In the third quarter of 2019, the FDIC announced that due to the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio exceeding 1.38%, banks with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion would be receiving credits against their deposit insurance assessments. The bank’s $1.1 million credit was applied as a reduction of FDIC assessments commencing with the payment of the second quarter assessment paid in September 2019 and were fully utilized by the end of the first quarter of 2020.
As previously disclosed, in the third quarter of 2019, the Bank discovered potentially fraudulent activity by a former treasury management client involving multiple banks. The former client subsequently filed several related bankruptcy cases, captioned In re Interlogic Outsourcing, Inc. et al., which are pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Michigan. The Bank and the other banks are currently subject to document and information requests in these bankruptcy cases and other related bankruptcy cases. The debtors have also requested the examinations of various current and former bank employees as part of the debtors’ investigation. On February 5, 2021, the former client and the other debtors in related bankruptcy cases filed a joint disclosure statement and a joint plan for liquidation with the bankruptcy court. In those documents, the debtors state that they have been investigating causes of action against various banks and other parties involved with the former customer, including the Bank. The debtors stated that, based on their investigation, which is ongoing, they believe that they hold claims and causes of action against the Bank. We cannot predict what legal claims, if any, will be made against the Bank. Based on current information, we have determined that a loss is neither probable nor estimable at this time, and the Bank intends to vigorously defend itself if any claim is filed.
Income Taxes
The Company recognized income tax expense in 2020 of $19.5 million, compared to $20.3 million in 2019 and $18.5 million in 2018. The effective tax rate in 2020 was 18.8% compared to 18.9% in 2019, and 18.7% in 2018. For a detailed analysis of the Company’s income taxes see Note 13 - Income Taxes.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Overview
Total assets of the Company were $5.830 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $883.7 million, or 17.9%, when compared to $4.947 billion as of December 31, 2019. Total loans increased by $583.3 million, or 14.3%, to $4.649 billion at December 31, 2020 from $4.066 billion at December 31, 2019. PPP loans originated during 2020 were $570.5 million and $412.0 remained outstanding at December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $150.5 million and available-for-sale securities increased by $126.6 million. Funding for the loan and investment growth came from a $903.0 million increase in total deposits as well as a $53.8 million increase in retained earnings, offset by an $84.5 million decrease in total borrowings. The Company used wholesale funding, including brokered deposits and FHLB advances, to provide liquidity for loan growth and to help maintain its desired interest rate risk position. During 2020, reliance on wholesale funding decreased as a result of strong core deposit growth.
Uses of Funds
Investment Portfolio
The amortized cost and the fair value of securities as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
At year-end 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government, government agencies and government sponsored agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity. See Note 2 - Securities for more information on these investments.
Purchases of securities available-for-sale totaled $216.5 million in 2020, $129.5 million in 2019 and $126.6 million in 2018. Growth of the investment portfolio during the past three years serves to provide liquidity for the Company and provide longer duration as an offset to the short duration of the loan portfolio. The Company targets investment securities as a percentage of total assets in a range from 11% - 14%. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company deployed excess liquidity to the investment portfolio in the amount of $100.0 million. Securities sales totaled $8.0 million in 2020, $57.1 million in 2019 and $15.3 million in 2018. Paydowns from prepayments and scheduled payments of $90.4 million, $53.0 million and $42.8 million were received in 2020, 2019 and 2018, and the amortization of premiums, net of the accretion of discounts, was $4.0 million, $3.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Maturities and calls of securities totaled $7.6 million, $14.8 million and $11.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No other- than-temporary impairment was recognized in 2020, 2019 or 2018. The investment portfolio is managed to provide for an appropriate balance between liquidity, credit risk and investment return and to limit the Company’s exposure to risk to an acceptable level.
The weighted average yields and maturity distribution for the securities portfolio at December 31, 2020, were as follows:
The Company does not trade or invest in or sponsor certain unregistered investment companies defined as hedge funds and private equity funds in the Volcker Rule.
Real Estate Mortgage Loans Held For Sale
Real estate mortgages held for sale increased by $6.7 million to $11.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $4.5 million at December 31, 2019 as a result of strong mortgage refinancing demand in response to the low interest rate environment. This asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on, among other things, recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market.

The loan portfolio by class as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:
The ratio of loans to total loans by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:
In 2020, net loan balances increased by $572.6 million to $4.588 billion, which excludes approximately $117.6 million in loans originated for sale.

In 2018, net loan balances increased by $95.0 million to $3.866 billion, which excludes approximately $49.8 million in loans originated for sale and $316,000 transferred to other real estate in 2018.
The mix of loan types within the Company’s portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans. This higher percentage of commercial loans to the total portfolio was a result of the Company’s long standing strategic plan that is focused on organic expansion and growth in commercial loans. Commercial and industrial loans together with owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represent 52.4% and 49.2% of total loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The owner-occupied commercial real estate loans tend to represent the real estate holding of our commercial and industrial loan customers. Another significant loan segment are loans to the agri-business sector, which has resulted in the Company becoming one of the largest agricultural lenders in the State of Indiana.
The residential construction and land development loans class included construction loans totaling $7.2 million, $8.1 million, $12.5 million, $10.0 million and $11.4 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Declines in consumer loans during 2020 resulted from paydowns due to borrower excess liquidity generated from mortgage refinancing activity. The Bank generally sells conforming mortgage loans which it originates on the secondary market. These loans generally represent mortgage loans that are made to clients with long-term or substantial relationships with the Bank on terms consistent with secondary market requirements. The loan classifications are based on the nature of the loans as of the loan origination date. There were no foreign loans included in the loan portfolio for the periods presented.

Sources of Funds
The average daily deposits and borrowings together with the average rates paid on those deposits and borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in the following table:
Time deposits as of December 31, 2020 will mature as follows:
Deposits
Total deposits increased by $903.0 million to $5.037 billion, comparing December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019. The growth in deposits consisted of $1.002 billion in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $98.5 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $664.3 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $301.9 million while public funds deposits increased by $35.3 million. The growth in deposits in 2020 resulted primarily from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Deposit growth was impacted by excess liquidity on customer balance sheets resulting from PPP loans, due to both economic stimulus payments made to retail customers and an increase in savings rates. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on public funds and wholesale funding during 2020.
Total deposits increased by $89.8 million to $4.134 billion, comparing December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018. The growth in deposits consisted of $141.1 million in core deposit growth offset by a decrease of $51.4 million in brokered deposits. Total deposit growth was led by an increase of $200.6 million in commercial deposits. In addition, retail deposits increased by $28.9 million while public funds deposits decreased by $88.4 million. The growth in deposits in 2019 resulted from increased deposit balances from new and existing customers, as well as a decreased utilization of brokered deposits. Core deposit growth enabled the Company to reduce reliance on wholesale funding during 2019.As previously noted, 23% of the Company’s deposit base is attributable to public fund entities which primarily represent customers in the Company’s geographic footprint. A shift in funding away from public fund deposits could require the Company to execute alternative funding plans under the Contingency Funding Plan discussed in further detail under “Liquidity Risk” below. The following table presents total deposits by portfolio segment as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings
During 2020, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $27.0 million to $34.3 million, primarily due to lower short-term FHLB borrowings. Ending balances of short-term and miscellaneous borrowings decreased $159.5 million during 2020 to $10.5 million. The decrease was due to the payoff of outstanding short-term FHLB borrowings. During 2020, the Company utilized $10.5 million of its holding company $30.0 million revolving line of credit in connect with its share repurchase activity. Short-term FHLB borrowings are used to fund short-term balance sheet growth due to the flexible nature of the financial instrument and allows the Company to prudently lend to commercial or retail borrowers when opportunities are presented. Average total long-term borrowings increased by $31.5 million to $62.3 million, primarily due to a $75.0 million long-term FHLB borrowing and the repayment of the Company’s subordinated debentures in December 2019.
During 2019, average total short-term borrowings decreased by $54.5 million to $61.3 million, primarily due to the discontinuance of securities sold under agreements to repurchase products in 2019. In addition, on December 30, 2019, the Company redeemed $30.0 million of subordinated debentures priced at three-month LIBOR plus 305 basis points. Ending balances of total short- term borrowings decreased $75.6 million during 2019 to $170.0 million, due to decreases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Capital
The Company believes that a strong, appropriately managed capital position is critical to long-term earnings and continuing growth in loans. Capital is used primarily to fund continued organic loan growth and to support dividends per share to shareholders. The Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.7%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 13.4% and a common Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.4% as of December 31, 2020. These ratios met or exceeded the Federal Reserve Bank’s “well-capitalized” minimums of 10.0%, 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively. The Company also had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.9% and a tangible equity ratio of 11.2%. See Note 16 - Capital Requirements for more information.
The ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy. Total stockholders’ equity increased by 9.9% to $657.2 million as of December 31, 2020 from $598.1 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company earned $84.3 million in 2020 and $87.0 million in 2019. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.20 per share in 2020, which decreased equity by $30.6 million. The Company declared cash dividends of $1.16 per share in 2019, which decreased equity by $29.7 million. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income was due to changes in the fair values of available-for-sale securities and the defined benefit pension which increased equity by $15.7 million in 2020 compared to an increase of $18.3 million in 2019. The impact to equity due to other comprehensive income is not included in regulatory capital. In addition, during 2020 the
Company repurchased 289,101 shares of its common stock for $10.0 million. Share repurchases under the repurchase plan were suspended in March of 2020 with $20.0 million of authorization remaining under the plan.
