Overview
General
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to applying our leading expertise in the field of oncolytic immunotherapy to transform the lives of cancer patients. We use our proprietary Immulytic platform to design and develop product candidates that are intended to maximally activate the immune system against cancer.
Oncolytic immunotherapy is an emerging drug class, which we intend to establish as the second cornerstone of immune-based cancer treatments, alongside checkpoint blockade. Oncolytic immunotherapy exploits the ability of certain viruses to selectively replicate in and directly kill tumors, as well as induce a potent, patient-specific, anti-tumor immune response. Our product candidates incorporate multiple mechanisms of action into a practical “off-the-shelf” approach that is intended to maximize the immune response against a patient’s cancer and to offer significant advantages over personalized vaccine approaches. We believe that the bundling of multiple approaches for the treatment of cancer into single therapies will simplify the development path of our product candidates, while also improving patient outcomes at a lower cost to the healthcare system than the use of multiple different drugs.
The foundation of our Immulytic platform consists of a proprietary, engineered strain of herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, that has been “armed” with a fusogenic glycoprotein intended to substantially increase anti-tumor activity. Our Immulytic platform enables us to incorporate various genes into HSV-1 that are intended to further augment the inherent properties of HSV-1 in order to both directly destroy tumor cells and induce an anti-tumor immune response. We currently have three product candidates in our development pipeline, RP1, our lead product candidate, RP2 and RP3.
We are conducting a number of clinical trials of RP1, both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, with a focus on immune-responsive tumors. We are actively enrolling patients in the CERPASS trial, a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of RP1 with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, RP1’s lead indication in agreement with our partner Regeneron. CERPASS is a registration-directed clinical trial evaluating RP1 in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron, versus cemiplimab alone. CERPASS is currently being amended, in agreement with Regeneron, to include two independent primary endpoints, complete response (CR) rate and overall response rate (ORR), rather than only ORR, and to reduce the sample size from 240 to 180 patients. Regeneron has granted to us a non-exclusive royalty-free license to cemiplimab for use in this trial, is funding one-half of the clinical trial costs, and is supplying cemiplimab at no cost. If this clinical trial generates compelling clinical data demonstrating the benefits of the combined treatment, we believe the data could support a filing with regulatory authorities seeking marketing approval. We expect the primary data read-out from this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2022.
We continue our collaboration with BMS under which it has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and is supplying at no cost, its anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP1 in our multi-cohort Phase 1/2 IGNYTE clinical trial. This trial includes a registration directed Phase 2
expansion cohort enrolling 125 patients with anti-PD-1 failed cutaneous melanoma who are being treated with RP1 in combination with nivolumab. We initiated this cohort after completing enrollment in a prior Phase 2 cohort in the same clinical trial of approximately 30 patients with melanoma, which demonstrated the safety and clinical activity of the combination of RP1 and nivolumab in patients with melanoma who failed prior anti-PD-1 when given alone or in combination with CTLA-4 blockade. In March 2021 we held a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of this cohort in the IGNYTE trial. In this meeting, the FDA expressed that while a randomized controlled clinical trial would always be preferred for registration purpose, that in this patient population with no clear standard of care, if the clinical data is sufficiently compelling then the data could be considered for submission by the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. The FDA also indicated that a randomized confirmatory trial would also be needed as is required under the accelerated approval pathway. The design of the confirmatory trial is intended to be discussed with the FDA prior to a BLA submission. In connection with a presentation at SITC in October 2020 we announced updated clinical data from our multi-cohort Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating RP1 in combination with nivolumab in patients with melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. As reported, RP1 in combination with nivolumab has continued to be well tolerated, and we believe demonstrates continued promising anti-tumor activity in patients with skin cancers, including in patients with anti-PD-1 failed melanoma, and in patients with CSCC. We expect that the primary data read-out from the registration directed Phase 2 melanoma cohort will be in 2022.
We continue to enroll patients in other IGNYTE Phase 2 cohorts under our collaboration with BMS in which we are evaluating RP1 in combination with nivolumab. Currently, enrollment is ongoing in a 45 patient cohort with non-melanoma skin cancer (including the recent addition of 15 patients who have failed prior anti-PD-1 therapy), a 15 patient cohort with MSI-H/dMMR tumors and a 30 patient cohort with anti-PD(L)-1 failed NSCLC. We recently began dosing a patient in the NSCLC cohort. Due in part to COVID-19 related disruptions, we now expect the original 30 patient non-melanoma skin cancer cohort to be fully accrued by mid-2021. We continue to accumulate data in the MSI-H/dMMR cohort and expect to decide whether to pursue MSI-H/dMMR tumors into registration-directed development by the end of 2021.
We have also opened for enrollment a Phase 1b clinical trial of single agent RP1 in solid organ transplant recipients with CSCC, or ARTACUS or the ARTACUS trial, which we believe to be potentially registrational (in its own right or, subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, following enrollment of additional patients, including as a potential label expansion after an initial approval of RP1 in a different indication). We are currently enrolling patients in this clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of RP1 in liver and kidney transplant recipients with recurrent CSCC and are currently targeting about 30 patients for this trial. Enrollment in this clinical trial has been impacted by COVID-19, as the patient population is severely immune-compromised and considered very high risk. Nevertheless, we have begun dosing patients and expect to present initial data from this clinical trial in the second half of the year.
We are also developing additional product candidates, RP2 and RP3, that have been further engineered to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and are intended to address additional tumor types, including traditionally less immune responsive tumor types. In addition to the expression of GALV-GP R(-) and human GM-CSF as in RP1, RP2 has been engineered to express an antibody-like molecule intended to block the activity of CTLA-4, a protein that inhibits the full activation of an immune response, including to tumors. RP3, which does not include the expression of GM-CSF, has been engineered with the intent to further stimulate an anti-tumor immune response through activation of immune co-stimulatory pathways through expression of the ligands for CD40 and 4-1BBL, in addition to anti-CTLA-4 and GALV-GP R(-).
We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 alone and in combination with nivolumab in the second half of 2019. This clinical trial is also being conducted as part of our collaboration with BMS, under which BMS has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to, and will supply at no cost, nivolumab, for use in combination with RP2. In November 2020, we and BMS agreed to increase the number of patients in the combination part of the clinical trial from 12 to 30 patients. In October 2020, we presented positive data from the single agent RP2 portion of the clinical trial that showed deep and durable responses, including demonstration of tumor response in uninjected lesions and in patients with difficult to treat advanced cancers. This data supports the hypothesis that anti-CTLA-4 delivered intra-tumorally through oncolytic virus replication, with accompanying antigen release and presentation, can provide potent anti-tumor effects.
Following the monotherapy phase of this clinical trial with RP2, enrollment in the expansion phase using RP2 in combination with nivolumab is currently underway and we expect to present initial data in mid-2021.
We have obtained clearance from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom to begin clinical development with RP3 and in December 2020 we initiated dosing in this clinical trial. This Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate RP3 alone and combined with anti-PD-1 therapy in advanced solid tumor patients. Initial data from this clinical trial is expected to be presented in the second half of 2021.
RP1, RP2 and RP3 are administered by direct injection into solid tumors, guided either visually or by ultrasound, computerized tomography, or CT, or other imaging methods. We believe that direct injection maximizes virus-mediated tumor cell death, provides the most efficient delivery of virus-encoded immune activating proteins into the tumor with the goal of activating systemic immunity, and limits the systemic toxicities that could be associated with intravenous administration. Activation of systemic immunity through local administration is intended to lead to the induction of anti-tumor immune responses leading to clinical response of tumors that have not themselves been injected.
Financial
Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our Immulytic platform building our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and to a lesser extent the proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
Since our initial public offering, or IPO, on July 24, 2018, we have raised an aggregate of approximately $569.0 million in net proceeds to fund our operations, of which $101.2 million was from our IPO, $463.4 million was from three separate follow-on offerings, or the Public Offerings, that we closed in November 2019, June 2020 and October 2020, respectively, and $4.4 million was from at-the-market offerings. We sold 7,407,936 shares of common stock in our IPO, an aggregate of 13,619,822 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 5,284,238 shares of our common stock in the Public Offerings, and 287,559 shares of common stock through our at-the-market facility.
Funds affiliated with two separate institutional investors hold all of our outstanding pre-funded warrants. Other than as set forth in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the shares of our common stock into which our outstanding pre-funded warrants are exercisable are not included in the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, on August 8, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, which we refer to as the Hercules Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million under a secured term loan facility in the amount of $30.0 million. The Hercules Loan Agreement was subsequently amended on June 1, 2020, in order to, among other things, increase the secured term loan facility from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. On December 15, 2020, we paid a total of $10.8 million, representing the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, costs and expenses due and owing under the Hercules Loan Agreement and related loan documents, in repayment of all of our outstanding obligations thereunder, and thereby terminated the Hercules Loan Agreement and the related loan documents.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $80.9 million and $52.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $193.2 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.
We anticipate that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates, and if and as we:
•
conduct our current and future clinical trials with RP1, RP2 and RP3;
•
further preclinical development of our platform;
•
operate our own in-house manufacturing facility;
•
seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;
•
seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•
until our manufacturing facility is fully validated, continued limited manufacturing by third parties for clinical development;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire and retain additional clinical, quality control, scientific and general and administration personnel;
•
acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for RP1 or our other product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership in any jurisdiction, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.
As a result, we will need additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, lines of credit, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $476.3 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
See “- Liquidity and capital resources” and “Risk factors - Risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital.”
The COVID-19 pandemic
We are continuing to monitor the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions
taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have implemented a global work from home policy for certain employees who are able to perform their duties remotely. For those employees working from our facilities, including certain essential employees in our laboratory and who perform manufacturing functions, and certain other employees we deem essential from time to time, we have implemented stringent safety measures designed to comply with applicable federal, state and local guidelines instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and has affected and may continue to affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including by causing disruptions in our raw material and anti-PD-1 supply, the manufacturing of our product candidates and our commercialization processes. In addition, timing of patient enrollment and treatment in certain of our ongoing clinical studies has been impacted by the pandemic. For example, the enrollment of our clinical trial of RP1 in liver and kidney transplant patients with CSCC, representing highly immunocompromised patient populations, has been slower than expected for reasons we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the extent of these delays is currently unknown and has and will likely continue to vary by clinical study. In addition, we may incur unforeseen costs as a result of disruptions in clinical supply or preclinical study or clinical trial delays. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken in an effort to contain it or to potentially treat or continue to vaccinate against COVID-19 and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. We continue to actively monitor this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. For additional information, see “Risk Factors - Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the coronavirus disease-2019, or COVID-19, outbreak.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of our results of operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales as we do not have any approved products and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for RP1 or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in regulatory approval, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from those collaborations or license agreements.
Operating expenses
Our expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, and include:
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including clinical research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical and clinical trials;
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•
the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements in connection with the development of our product candidates; and
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
These costs will be partially offset by our agreement with Regeneron related to our CERPASS trial.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.
Our direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not allocate personnel costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. All non-employee costs associated with our manufacturing facility have been fully burdened to our RP1 program.
The table below summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for each of the periods presented:
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue enrollment and initiate additional clinical trials and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:
•
the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our ongoing clinical trials, as well as future clinical trials or other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•
uncertainties in clinical trial design;
•
the rate of enrollment in clinical trials;
•
the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
our success in operating our manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;
•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•
the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved;
•
the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;
•
our ability to successfully develop our product candidates for use in combination with third-party products or product candidates;
•
negative developments in the field of immuno-oncology;
•
competition with other products; and
•
significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment, the COVID-19 pandemic, or other reasons, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to continue to incur increased expenses, including accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.
Other income (expense), net
Research and development incentives
Research and development incentives consists of reimbursements of research and development expenditures from governmental authorities. We participate, through our subsidiary in the United Kingdom, in the research and development program provided by the United Kingdom tax relief program, such that a percentage of up to 14.5% of our qualifying research and development expenditures are reimbursed by the United Kingdom government, and such incentives are reflected as other income.
Investment income
Investment income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Interest expense on finance lease liability
Interest expense on finance lease liability consists of amortization of finance charges under our financing lease.
Interest expense on debt obligations
Interest expense on debt obligations consists of the amortization of debt discount and cash paid for interest under the term loan facility with Hercules.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt consists of the loss from extinguishment of debt obligations under the term loan facility with Hercules.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Income taxes
Since our inception and through March 31, 2021, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we incurred in each jurisdiction in which we operate, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.
Results of operations
Comparison of the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $56.8 million, compared to $38.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase of $18.0 million was due primarily to an increase of $16.0 million in direct research costs related to our clinical trials for RP1, RP2 and RP3, as well as a net increase in unallocated research and development costs of $1.9 million. The increase in RP1 costs was due primarily to an increase in clinical trial costs in the year ended March 31, 2021 associated with the advancement of our ongoing clinical trials as well as costs associated with operations of our manufacturing facility allocated to RP1. The increase in costs associated with RP2 and RP3 are primarily associated with the continued clinical trial development of these product candidates.
In addition, the increase in unallocated research and development expenses is mainly attributable to an $8.3 million increase in personnel-related costs, including a $6.6 million increase in payroll and fringe benefits and a stock-based compensation increase of $2.1 million. The increase in personnel-related costs largely reflected the hiring of additional personnel in our research and development functions as we expanded the development plan of our product candidates in multiple indications. Personnel related costs for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 included stock-based compensation expense of $5.7 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Other costs decreased primarily due to our manufacturing operations focused on the potential registrational studies associated with our RP1 development plan with multiple cohorts.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $23.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, compared to $17.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase of $5.8 million primarily reflects an increase of approximately $3.7 million in personnel related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.0 million, which is driven by the hiring of additional personnel in our general and administrative functions as we expanded our R&D operations in the United States. Additionally, the change is driven, in part, by an increase of approximately $1.3 million in facility and other variable costs due to an increase in costs associated with maintaining our directors and officers insurance policy.
Total other (expense) income, net
Other (expense) income for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $(0.9) million compared to $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease of $4.5 million is primarily attributable to a $1.5 million decrease in investment income as a result of declining market conditions on a year-over-year basis, which have decreased the rate of return on investments, and a $1.1 million increase in expense related to interest on our financing lease liability.
Liquidity and capital resources
Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, which are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for the foreseeable future, if at all.
Sources of liquidity
To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. Through March 31, 2021, we had received net proceeds of $655.8 million from our sales of equity instruments and $10.0 million from our incurrence of debt under the term loan facility with Hercules, which was repaid in full in December 2020. As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $476.3 million.
In July 2018, we completed our IPO and issued and sold 7,407,936 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $101.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $9.9 million. In the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, we closed a registered public offering for the issuance and sale of 4,516,561 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.61 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $13.6099 per pre-funded warrant, which was equal to the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $85.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $5.8 million. In June 2020, we closed a second registered public offering for the issuance and sale of 3,478,261 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $23.00 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,521,738 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $22.9999 per pre-funded warrant, which was equal to the public offering price per share of common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $107.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $7.2 million. In October 2020, we closed a third registered public offering for the issuance and sale of 5,625,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $40.00 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,562,500 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $39.9999 per pre-funded warrant, the public offering price per share of common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $270.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $17.5 million.
In addition to registered public equity offerings, we also established an at-the-market offering program pursuant to a sales agreement that we entered into with SVB Leerink LLC, or the Agent, on August 8, 2019, or the 2019 Sales Agreement. Under the 2019 Sales Agreement, and prior to its amendment in June 2020, we could sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock. In June 2020, we amended the 2019 Sales Agreement to reduce the aggregate offering amount thereunder from $75.0 million to $30.0 million. We sold 287,559 shares of our common stock under the 2019 Sales Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $4.4 million. On August 11, 2020, in connection with our entry into separate sales agreement with the Agent, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, we and the Agent mutually agreed to terminate the 2019 Sales Agreement. Under the 2020 Sales Agreement, and prior to its amendment in October 2020, we could sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $75.0 million of shares of our common stock. In October 2020, we amended the 2020 Sales Agreement to reduce the aggregate offering amount thereunder from $75.0 million to $62.5 million. We have not sold any shares of our common stock under the 2020 Sales Agreement.
Our incurrence of debt was conducted entirely under the Hercules Loan Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million of a maximum of $40.0 million. On December 15, 2020, we entered into a Payoff Letter with Hercules and paid a total of $10.8 million to Hercules in connection therewith, representing the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, costs and expense due and owed to Hercules, thereby terminating the Hercules Loan Agreement and the related loan documents.
Cash flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented:
Operating activities
During the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $61.4 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $80.9 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash charges of $16.0 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation expense, and an increase in cash of $3.5 million related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by our changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of a $3.4 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a net $2.5 million increase in cash related to ASC 842 (including changes in operating lease liabilities, operating lease, right-of-use asset and financing lease right-of-use asset), a $1.7 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $1.0 million decrease in accounts payable and a $0.3 million increase in research and development incentives receivable from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures. The changes in accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $60.6 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $52.6 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $15.4 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $14.4 million net increase related to the adoption of ASC 842 (including changes in long-term prepaid rent operating lease liabilities, operating lease, right-of-use asset and financing lease, right-of-use-asset), a $3.8 million decrease in accounts payable and a $0.6 million increase in research and development incentives receivable from the United Kingdom government due to the timing and amount of our qualifying expenditures, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $2.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the recognition of prepaid amounts paid to vendors.
Investing activities
During the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $188.8 million, consisting of $392.4 million in purchases of available for sale securities which were primarily driven by the receipt of proceeds from two registered public offerings during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as well as $2.4 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $206.1 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million, consisting of $149.7 million in purchases of available for sale securities which was primarily driven by the receipt of proceeds for a registered public offering during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as well as $6.5 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $151.0 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.
Financing Activities
During the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $372.5 million, consisting of $286.1 million from the issuance of common stock, $91.7 million from the issuance of pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock, $5.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $10.0 million in debt payments under the Hercules Loan Agreement and $0.8 million of fees associated with the extinguishment of the obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $100.2 million, consisting of $57.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $28.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock, $10.0 million in proceeds from the incurrence of long-term debt, $4.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through sales under our at-the-market offering program and $0.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.4 million in payments of issuance costs and $0.1 million in principal payments of finance lease obligations.
Hercules Loan Agreement
On August 8, 2019 and as amended on June 1, 2020, we and certain of our affiliates entered into the Hercules Loan Agreement with Hercules, which provided for aggregate borrowings of up to $40 million in the form of term loans. We borrowed $10.0 million at closing under the Hercules Loan Agreement in August 2019 and subject to the achievement of certain milestones, had the ability to borrow the unused $30.0 million available in three separate $10.0 million advances between October 1, 2020 and December 15, 2020, July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, and July 1, 2021 and December 15, 2021, respectively.
On December 15, 2020, we entered into a Payoff Letter with respect to the Hercules Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Payoff Letter, we paid a total of $10.8 million to Hercules, representing the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, costs and expenses due and owed to Hercules under the Hercules Loan Agreement. Upon the execution of the Payoff Letter, in repayment of all of our outstanding obligations thereunder, the Hercules Loan Agreement and the related loan documents were terminated.
Borrowings under the Hercules Loan Agreement bore interest at a rate per annum equal to 8.75%. Under the Hercules Loan Agreement, we were required to make monthly interest-only payments through September 1, 2022. As of March 31, 2021, there was no amount outstanding under the Hercules Loan Agreement due and owing.
The Term Loan Facility with Hercules was secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, and subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. All liens on our assets held by Hercules were released in connection with the execution of the Payoff Letter.
Funding requirements
Our plan of operation is to continue implementing our business strategy, continue research and development of RP1 and our other product candidates and continue to expand our research pipeline
and our internal research and development capabilities. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates and if and as we:
•
conduct our current and future clinical trials with RP1, RP2 and RP3;
•
further preclinical development of our platform;
•
operate our own in-house manufacturing facility;
•
seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;
•
seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•
until our planned manufacturing facility is fully validated, continued limited manufacturing by third parties for clinical development.
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.
As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $476.3 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our overall operations into the second half of 2024. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of RP1 and other product candidates and programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including those described in this section and above under “- Operating expenses - Research and development expenses.”
Developing novel biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of therapies that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of our equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders’ interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholder. Additional debt or
preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt adversely impact our ability to conduct our business, and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interest.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce and/or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual obligations and commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:
(1)
Amounts in the table reflect commitments for costs associated with our external CMO, which we engaged to manufacture clinical trial materials.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for clinical trials and preclinical research studies and testing. Manufacturing and research commitments in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.
Collaborations
BMS
In February 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. Pursuant to the agreement, BMS is providing to us, at no cost, nivolumab, its anti-PD-1 therapy, for use in combination with RP1 in our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Under the agreement, we will sponsor, fund and conduct the clinical trial in accordance with an agreed-upon protocol. BMS granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty-free license (with a right to sublicense) under its intellectual property to use nivolumab in the clinical trial and has agreed to supply nivolumab, at no cost to us, for use in the clinical trial. Both parties will own the study data produced in the clinical trial, other than study data related solely to nivolumab, which will belong solely to BMS, or study data related solely to RP1, which will belong solely to us. In January 2020, this agreement was expanded to cover an additional cohort of 125 patients with anti-PD-1 failed melanoma.
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until (i) the completion of the clinical trial, (ii) all related clinical trial data have been delivered to both parties and (iii) the completion of any statistical analyses and bioanalyses contemplated by the clinical trial protocol or any analysis otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The agreement may be terminated by either party (i) in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, (ii) in the event the other party is insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings or (iii) for safety reasons. Upon termination, the licenses granted to us to use nivolumab in the clinical trial will terminate. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature.
In April 2019, we entered into a separate agreement with BMS on terms similar to the terms set forth in the agreement described above, pursuant to which BMS will provide, at no cost to us, nivolumab for use in our Phase 1 clinical trial of RP2 in combination with nivolumab.
Regeneron
In May 2018, we entered into a Master Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron. Pursuant to the agreement we agreed to undertake one or more clinical trials with Regeneron for the administration of our product candidates in combination with cemiplimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Regeneron, across multiple solid tumor types, the first of which is our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial testing RP1 in combination with cemiplimab versus cemiplimab alone in patients with CSCC. Each clinical trial will be conducted pursuant to an agreed study plan which, among other things, will identify the name of the sponsor and which party will manage the particular study, and include the protocol, the budget and a schedule of clinical obligations. The first study plan related to the Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC has been agreed.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, each party granted the other party a non-exclusive license of their respective intellectual property and agreed to contribute the necessary resources needed to fulfill their respective obligations, in each case, under the terms of agreed study plans. Development costs of a particular clinical trial will be split equally. The agreement contains representations, warranties, undertakings and indemnities customary for a transaction of this nature. The agreement also contains certain time-based covenants that restrict us from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of our product
candidates in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy and that restrict Regeneron from entering into a third-party arrangement with respect to the use of cemiplimab in combination with an HSV-1 virus, in each case, for the treatment of a tumor type that is the subject of a clinical trial to which the covenants apply. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in a future study plan, these covenants are only applicable to our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in CSCC, and expire upon the one-year anniversary of the commencement of the applicable study plan.
The agreement may be terminated by either party if (i) there is no active study plan for which a final study report has not been completed and the parties have not entered into a study plan for an additional clinical trial within a period of time after the delivery of the most recent final study report or (ii) in the event of a material breach.
Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued research and development expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
CROs in connection with performing research activities and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;
•
CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;
•
investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials;
•
vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and
•
vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on
factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-based compensation
We issue stock-based awards to employees, directors, consultants and non-employees in the form of stock options and restricted stock units. We measure such stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires all stock-based awards to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair value on the date of the grant and the related compensation expense for those awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have, to date, only issued stock-based awards with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of each stock-based award is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of our common stock on that same date.
We classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business and may potentially have an impact on our financial position and results of operations
Emerging growth company status
As an “emerging growth company,” the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
