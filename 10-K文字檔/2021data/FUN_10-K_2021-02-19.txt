ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Business Overview
We generate our revenues from sales of (1) admission to our amusement parks and water parks, (2) food, merchandise and games both inside and outside our parks, and (3) accommodations, extra-charge products, and other revenue sources. Our principal costs and expenses, which include salaries and wages, operating supplies, maintenance, advertising and utilities, are relatively fixed for an operating season and do not vary significantly with attendance.
Each of our properties is overseen by a general manager and operates autonomously. Management reviews operating results, evaluates performance and makes operating decisions, including allocating resources, on a property-by-property basis.
Along with attendance and in-park per capita spending statistics, discrete financial information and operating results are prepared at the individual park level for use by the CEO, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), as well as by the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, Regional Vice Presidents and the general managers.
The following table presents certain financial data expressed as a percent of total net revenues and selective statistical information for the periods indicated.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
Summary
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a material impact on our business in 2020, is expected to have a continuing negative impact in 2021 and may have a longer-term negative effect. On March 14, 2020, we closed our properties in response to the spread of COVID-19 and local government mandates. We ultimately resumed only partial operations at 10 of our 13 properties in 2020. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we resumed partial operations at eight properties on a staggered basis with opening dates starting in mid-June and continuing through mid-July. We also reopened operations at some of our out-of-park attractions at this time, such as hotel operations. Attendance upon reopening was impacted by the ongoing effects of the pandemic and was below original expectations. However, demand steadily increased from 20-25% of comparable prior-year attendance levels upon initially reopening up to 55% of comparable prior-year attendance levels in September 2020. Due to these soft demand trends upon reopening, park operating calendars were adjusted for the remainder of 2020, including reduced operating days per week and operating hours within each operating day. In addition, some of our reopened parks closed earlier than the park's typical operating calendar. Two parks, Cedar Point and Kings Island, remained open after Labor
Day. In order to alleviate social distancing concerns, Cedar Point and Kings Island changed their fall entertainment programming from traditional Haunt or Halloweekends events to a fall festival to allow for better management of social distancing and limited park capacity requirements. Two additional parks, Carowinds and Kings Dominion, reopened on weekends in November and December to host abbreviated versions of their traditional WinterFest events. Following March 14, 2020, Knott's Berry Farm's partial operations were limited to culinary festivals. Net revenues from these limited operations at Knott's Berry Farm were classified as out-of-park revenues. Attendance, in-park per capita spending and operating day statistics for 2020 exclude these limited operations at Knott's Berry Farm.
A summary of 2020 park opening and closing dates following the March 14, 2020 closure of our properties follows:
(1) Some of our out-of-park attractions were able to operate outside of the referenced dates, including hotel operations.
(2) Unlike the other parks classified as "Opened", Knott's Berry Farm was unable to reopen amusement park operations. Following March 14, 2020, Knott's Berry Farm's partial operations were limited to culinary festivals. These limited operations at Knott's Berry Farm were classified as out-of-park revenues. Attendance, in-park per capita spending and operating day statistics for 2020 exclude these limited operations at Knott's Berry Farm.
(3) Park closed earlier than the park's typical operating calendar.
In order to ensure our season pass holders receive a full season of access to our parks, in April 2020, we extended the usage privileges of 2020 season passes through the 2021 season and paused collections of guest payments on installment purchase products. For those parks which opened during the summer of 2020, we resumed collections of guest payments on installment purchase products as each of these parks opened for the 2020 operating season. For those parks which did not open during the summer of 2020, we will resume collections of guest payments as each of these parks opens for the 2021 operating season. For those parks that we announced on August 4, 2020 would not reopen in 2020, we also provided our season pass holders a loyalty reward to be used on purchases within the park during the 2021 operating season.
Liquidity
Following the March 14, 2020 closure of our properties and in response to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took steps in 2020 to secure additional liquidity and to obtain relief from certain financial covenants.
On April 27, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion of 5.500% senior secured notes due 2025 and amended the 2017 Credit Agreement to suspend and revise certain financial covenants, and to adjust the interest rate on and reflect additional commitments and capacity for our revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and in response to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we issued an additional $300 million of 6.500% senior unsecured notes due 2028 and further amended the 2017 Credit Agreement to further suspend and revise certain of the financial covenants. The fourth quarter 2020 credit agreement amendment also extended the maturity of and adjusted the terms that apply to a portion of our senior secured revolving credit facility. See the Long-Term Debt footnote at Note 8 for further details.
Other steps taken in 2020 to secure additional liquidity included suspending quarterly partnership distributions and suspending a series of capital expenditures planned for the 2020 and 2021 operating seasons. Capital expenditures for 2020 totaled $129.1 million, reflecting a reduction of approximately $60 million from our initial budget. We also reduced operating expenses and cash outflows while all of our operations were idled by temporarily eliminating nearly all of our seasonal and part-time labor costs, suspending advertising and marketing expenses, reducing general and administrative and other park-level operating expenses,
reducing the base salaries of our CEO and other executives, deferring base salaries for all other salaried employees, reducing hours for full-time hourly employees, and suspending cash retainer fees for the Board of Directors.
Following the opening of partial operations at eight of our properties, we resumed paying full base salaries to our CEO, other executives and all other salaried employees. We also increased scheduled hours for full-time hourly employees to 40 hours per week, and resumed cash retainer fees to our Board of Directors. For those parks operating, we incurred seasonal and part-time labor expenses, park-level operating expenses and advertising expenses to correspond with lower than typical attendance levels and abbreviated park operating calendars.
Governmental Economic Assistance
During 2020, we benefited from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act"), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. We expect to recognize two benefits. First, we expect to carryback the 2020 losses incurred by our corporate subsidiaries, which will result in refunds of a portion of federal income taxes paid during the carryback period of approximately $55.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Second, as of December 31, 2020, the annual effective tax rate included a net benefit of $18.1 million from carrying back the projected 2020 losses of the corporate subsidiaries. This tax benefit represents an estimated $34.2 million incremental benefit of tax loss carrybacks for periods when the federal income tax rate was greater than the current 21% rate. The estimated $34.2 million benefit was decreased by $16.1 million for a projected valuation allowance on foreign tax credits originally utilized during the carryback period which would be released as a result of the loss carryback but which are not expected to be utilized.
Additional benefits from the CARES Act included an $8.2 million deferral of the employer's share of Social Security taxes due in 50% increments in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2022, and $3.7 million in tax benefits from the Employee Retention Credit program.
We also received $5.0 million from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ("CEWS"), which provides cash payments to Canadian employers that experienced a decline in revenues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Impairment
Due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our expected future operating results, we tested our long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of March 29, 2020 and September 27, 2020 resulting in $106.7 million of impairment charges recorded, primarily related to the recently acquired Schlitterbahn parks.
Management has made significant estimates and assumptions to determine our liquidity requirements and estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including financial results in the near and long-term. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates depending on the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
2021 Outlook
As we continue to actively work with state and local officials, we have established May 2021 opening dates for our seasonal parks. Knott's Berry Farm, our only year-round park, has announced a new culinary festival beginning in March 2021. The culinary festivals at Knott's Berry Farm are expected to continue until state and local officials lift restrictions to allow us to resume normal amusement park operations. Prior to reopening, pre-opening expenses will be minimized. With broad vaccination distribution efforts in process and anticipated pent-up demand for outdoor entertainment, management is focused on maximizing the seasonally weighted second half of 2021. A substantial portion of our revenues are typically generated during the peak vacation months of July and August allowing for broader vaccine distribution and a potential reduction of COVID-19 restrictions before these key months. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have a sizeable base of approximately 1.8 million season passes outstanding and valid for the 2021 operating season following the extension of usage privileges for 2020 season passes through the 2021 operating season. Despite these positive indicators, we do not anticipate 2021 to be a normal operating year operationally or financially, and it is uncertain how long it may take us to achieve full operational potential. Our future operations are dependent on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. See Risk Factors at Item 1A. In January 2021, Knott's Berry Farm announced a day for day extension into calendar year 2022 for 2020 and 2021 season passes for every day the park is closed in 2021. No other parks have announced similar plans.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. The following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity (see Note 3 for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies). Application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties, and as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying values of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using a combination of a cost and market approach. Significant factors considered in the cost approach include the replacement cost, reproduction cost, depreciation, physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence of the asset. The market approach estimates fair value by utilizing market data for similar assets. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available.
The determination of undiscounted cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date. Subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists and whether the effects could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
Due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our expected future operating results, we tested our long-lived assets for impairment as of March 29, 2020 and September 27, 2020 (see Note 6). Management made significant estimates in performing these impairment tests, including the anticipated time frame to re-open our parks following the COVID-19 pandemic and the related anticipated demand upon re-opening our parks following the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates depending on the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the ongoing development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably predicted.
Accounting for Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. The fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts and other relevant information. The valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. The determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management. If future operating results do not meet expectations or anticipated synergies are not realized, the Schlitterbahn reporting unit may become further impaired.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trade-names, are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in equity price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
It is possible that our assumptions about future performance, as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding valuation, could change adversely, which may result in additional impairment that would have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods.
Due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our expected future operating results, we tested our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of March 29, 2020 and September 27, 2020 (see Note 7). Management made significant estimates in performing these impairment tests, including the anticipated time frame to re-open our parks following the COVID-19 pandemic and the related anticipated demand upon re-opening our parks following the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates depending on the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the ongoing development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably predicted. In conjunction with our annual measurement date, we completed the review of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles as of the first days of the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019 and determined goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles were not further impaired as of these testing dates.
Self-Insurance Reserves
Self-insurance reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims and are recorded when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon our own claims data history. Self-insurance reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as
necessary. The ultimate cost for identified claims can be difficult to predict due to the unique facts and circumstances associated with each claim.
Revenue Recognition
As disclosed within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, revenues are generated from sales of (1) admission to our amusement parks and water parks, (2) food, merchandise and games both inside and outside the parks, and (3) accommodations, extra-charge products, and other revenue sources. Most revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spend at the properties. Revenues from multi-use products, including season-long products for admission, dining, beverage and other products, are recognized over the estimated number of uses expected for each type of product. The estimated number of uses is reviewed and may be updated periodically during the operating season prior to the ticket or product expiration, which generally occurs no later than the close of the operating season. The number of uses is estimated based on historical usage adjusted for current period trends.
Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the validity of our 2020 season-long products through the 2021 operating season in order to ensure our season pass holders receive a full season of access to our parks. The extended validity of the 2020 season-long products resulted in a significant amount of revenue deferred into 2021. In order to calculate revenue recognized in 2020 on 2020 season-long products, management made significant estimates regarding the estimated number of uses expected for these season-long products for admission, dining, beverage and other products for the 2021 operating season. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates depending on the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the ongoing development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably predicted.
Income Taxes
Our legal entity structure includes both partnerships and corporate subsidiaries. We are subject to publicly traded partnership tax ("PTP tax") on certain partnership level gross income (net revenues less cost of food, merchandise, and games revenues), state and local income taxes on partnership income, U.S. federal state and local income taxes on income from our corporate subsidiaries and foreign income taxes on our foreign subsidiary. As such, the total (benefit) provision for taxes includes amounts for the PTP gross income tax and federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. Under applicable accounting rules, the total (benefit) provision for income taxes includes the amount of taxes payable for the current year and the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represents future tax consequences of events that are recognized in different periods in the financial statements than for tax purposes.
Our corporate subsidiaries account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income at the time of enactment of such change in tax law. Any interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are included in the provision for income taxes.
We record a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The need for this allowance is based on several factors including the ten-year carryforward period allowed for excess foreign tax credits, experience to date of foreign tax credit limitations, carryforward periods of state net operating losses, and management's long-term estimates of domestic and foreign source income.
There is inherent uncertainty in the estimates used to project the amount of foreign tax credit and state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized. It is possible that our future income projections, as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding valuation allowances could change, which may result in additional valuation allowance being recorded or may result in additional valuation allowance reductions, and which may have a material negative or positive effect on our reported financial position and results of operations in future periods.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items, and adjustments as defined in the Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement and prior agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of operating performance computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure as it is widely used by analysts, investors and comparable companies in our industry to evaluate our operating performance on a consistent basis, as well as more easily compare our results with those of other companies in our industry. Further, management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of park-level operating profitability and we use it for measuring returns on capital investments, evaluating potential acquisitions, determining awards under incentive compensation plans, and calculating compliance with certain loan covenants. Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the discussion of results of operations that follows as a supplemental measure of our operating results and is not intended to be a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities as defined under GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The table below sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income for the periods indicated:
(1) Consists of certain costs as defined in our Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement and prior credit agreements. These items are excluded in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and have included certain legal expenses and severance expenses. This balance also includes unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments.
Results of Operations
We believe the following are key operational measures in our management and operational reporting, and they are used as major factors in significant operational decisions as they are primary drivers of our financial and operational performance:
Attendance is defined as the number of guest visits to our amusement parks and separately gated outdoor water parks.
In-park per capita spending is calculated as revenues generated within our amusement parks and separately gated outdoor water parks along with related tolls and parking revenues (in-park revenues), divided by total attendance.
Out-of-park revenues are defined as revenues from resort, marina, sponsorship, online transaction fees charged to customers and all other out-of-park operations.
Net revenues consist of in-park revenues and out-of-park revenues less amounts remitted to outside parties under concessionaire arrangements (see Note 5).
2020 vs. 2019
The results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not directly comparable with the results for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to park closures and operating calendar changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (the "COVID-19 disruption"). On March 14, 2020, we closed our properties in response to the spread of COVID-19. We ultimately resumed only partial operations at 10 of our 13 properties in 2020. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we resumed partial operations at eight properties on a staggered basis with opening dates starting in mid-June and continuing through mid-July. We also reopened operations at some of our out-of-park attractions at this time, such as hotel operations. Attendance upon reopening was impacted by the ongoing effects of the pandemic and was below original expectations. Due to these soft demand trends upon reopening, park operating calendars were adjusted for the remainder of 2020, including reduced operating days per week and operating hours within each operating day. In addition, some of our reopened parks closed earlier than the park's typical operating calendar. Two parks, Cedar Point and Kings Island, remained open after Labor Day. Two additional parks, Carowinds and Kings Dominion, reopened on weekends in November and December to host abbreviated versions of their traditional WinterFest events. Following March 14, 2020, Knott's Berry Farm's partial operations were limited to culinary festivals. Net revenues from these limited operations at Knott's Berry Farm were classified as out-of-park revenues. Attendance, in-park per capita spending and operating day statistics for 2020 exclude these limited operations at Knott's Berry Farm.
As a result of the COVID-19 disruption, the current year included 487 operating days compared with 2,224 operating days for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table presents key financial information and operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
(1) For additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, including how we define and use Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation from net (loss) income, see page 20.
Consolidated net revenues totaled $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreasing $1.3 billion, from $1.5 billion for 2019. This reflected the impact of a 25.3 million-visit decrease in attendance, a $1.94 decrease in in-park per capita spending, and a $101.3 million decrease in out-of-park revenues, all of which were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 disruption. The decrease in attendance was due to the aforementioned park closures and operating calendar changes, as well as soft initial demand upon re-opening our parks. However, demand steadily increased from 20-25% of comparable prior-year attendance
levels upon initially reopening up to 55% of comparable prior-year attendance levels in September 2020. The decrease in in-park per capita spending was the result of less guest spending on extra-charge products, specifically front-of-line products, and admission attributable to a higher season pass mix. In-park per capita spending on food, merchandise and games increased compared with the prior year. The decrease in out-of-park revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in accommodations revenue related to a decrease in occupancy due to the COVID-19 disruption, as well as a decrease in online transaction fee revenue due to a decline in online sales volume. Net revenues were not materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates.
Operating costs and expenses for 2020 decreased 51.2%, or $506.8 million, to $483.9 million from $990.7 million for 2019. The decrease was the result of a $98.3 million decrease in cost of food, merchandise and games revenues ("COGS"), a $294.4 million decrease in operating expenses, and a $114.1 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses ("SG&A"). The decrease in COGS was due to the decline in sales volume from the COVID-19 disruption and soft initial demand at our open parks. The $294.4 million decrease in operating expenses was attributable to $167.5 million of seasonal labor savings, as well as reductions in operating supplies, maintenance supplies, utilities, entertainment-related fees and insurance attributable to closed properties, abbreviated operating calendars and fewer offerings at our parks. In addition, full-time wages decreased due to a decline in anticipated payout of bonus plans. The $114.1 million decrease in SG&A expense was attributable to $57.5 million of advertising expense savings, as well as a reduction in transaction fee expense due to a decline in online sales volume, a decline in the anticipated payout of outstanding equity-based compensation and bonus plans, and prior period acquisition-related costs. Operating costs and expenses were not materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates.
Depreciation and amortization expense for 2020 decreased $12.9 million compared with 2019 primarily due to the prior period change in estimated useful life of a long-lived asset at Kings Dominion. The loss on impairment / retirement of fixed assets for 2020 was $8.1 million compared with $4.9 million for 2019. The current year included a $2.7 million impairment charge with respect to the Schlitterbahn parks' long-lived assets triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2020 (see Note 6), as well as the impairment of two specific assets during the first quarter of 2020. Similarly triggered by the anticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the loss on impairment of goodwill and other intangibles for 2020 included a $73.6 million, $6.8 million and $7.9 million impairment of goodwill at the Schlitterbahn parks, goodwill at Dorney Park, and the Schlitterbahn trade name, respectively, during the first quarter of 2020, and an $11.3 million, $2.3 million and $2.2 million impairment of goodwill at the Schlitterbahn parks, goodwill at Dorney Park, and the Schlitterbahn trade name, respectively, during the third quarter of 2020 (see Note 7). During the first quarter of 2019, a $0.6 million gain on sale of investment was recognized for additional proceeds from the liquidation of a preferred equity investment.
After the items above, operating loss for 2020 totaled $572.0 million compared with operating income of $309.4 million for 2019.
Interest expense for 2020 increased $50.3 million due to interest incurred on the 2025 senior notes issued in April 2020 and on the 2029 senior notes issued in late June 2019. The net effect of our swaps resulted in a $15.8 million charge to earnings for 2020 compared with a $16.5 million charge to earnings for 2019. The difference was attributable to the change in fair market value of our swap portfolio. We recognized a $2.3 million loss on early debt extinguishment related to our 2020 refinancing events (see Note 8). During 2020, we also recognized a $12.2 million net benefit to earnings for foreign currency gains and losses compared with a $21.1 million net benefit to earnings for 2019. Both amounts primarily represent remeasurement of the U.S.-dollar denominated debt recorded at our Canadian entity from the U.S.-dollar to the legal entity's functional currency.
For 2020, a benefit for taxes of $137.9 million was recorded to account for PTP taxes and federal, state, local and foreign income taxes compared with a provision for taxes recorded for 2019 of $42.8 million. The increase in benefit for taxes was attributable to an increase in pretax loss from our taxable subsidiaries, as well as expected benefits from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act"), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act resulted in various changes to the U.S. tax law, including, among other things, allowing net operating losses arising in tax years 2018 through 2020 to be carried back to the preceding five taxable years and removing the limitation that such losses only offset 80% of taxable income. As a result of these changes, we expect to recognize two benefits. First, we expect to carryback the 2020 losses incurred by our corporate subsidiaries, which will result in the refund of a portion of federal income taxes paid during the carryback period of approximately $55.4 million. Second, as of December 31, 2020, the annual effective tax rate included a net benefit of $18.1 million from carrying back the projected 2020 losses of the corporate subsidiaries. This tax benefit represents an estimated $34.2 million incremental benefit of tax loss carrybacks for periods when the federal income tax rate was greater than the current 21% rate. The estimated $34.2 million benefit was decreased by $16.1 million for a projected valuation allowance on foreign tax credits originally utilized during the carryback period which would be released as a result of the loss carryback but which are not expected to be utilized.
After the items above, net loss for 2020 totaled $590.2 million, or $10.45 per diluted limited partner unit, compared with net income of $172.4 million, or $3.03 per diluted unit, for 2019.
For 2020, Adjusted EBITDA loss totaled $302.0 million compared with a $504.7 million Adjusted EBITDA for 2019. The variance in Adjusted EBITDA was due to decreased net revenues offset somewhat by expense savings attributable to the COVID-19 disruption.
2019 vs. 2018
The results for the year ended December 31, 2019 were not directly comparable with the results for the year ended December 31, 2018. The year ended December 31, 2019 included results from the operations of the Schlitterbahn parks from the July 1, 2019 acquisition date. Since many differences in our operating results related to the acquisition, we also included a discussion of operating results excluding the results of the Schlitterbahn parks (or on a "same-park" basis).
The year ended December 31, 2019 included 2,224 operating days compared with 2,061 operating days for the year ended December 31, 2018. On a same-park basis, the year ended December 31, 2019 included 2,079 operating days. The increase in same-park operating days from the year ended December 31, 2018 was largely due to the inaugural Canada's Wonderland WinterFest event, a holiday event operating during November and December, in 2019. The following table presents key financial information and operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:
(1) For additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, including how we define and use Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation from net (loss) income, see page 20.
(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues) is not a measurement computed in accordance with GAAP or a substitute for measures computed in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We provide Adjusted EBITDA margin because we believe the measure provides a meaningful metric of operating profitability.
Consolidated net revenues totaled $1,474.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, increasing $126.4 million, from $1,348.5 million for 2018. This reflected the impact of a 2.0 million visit increase in attendance and a $0.63 increase in in-park per capita spending. Out-of-park revenues increased $16.5 million compared with 2018. The increase in net revenues was net of a $10.4 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange related to our Canadian park.
Operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 11.0%, or $98.3 million, to $990.7 million from $892.4 million for 2018. The increase was the result of an $11.5 million increase in COGS, a $57.9 million increase in operating expenses, and a $28.9 million increase in SG&A expense. The increase in operating costs and expenses was net of a $5.1 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange related to our Canadian park. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2019 increased $14.9 million compared with 2018.
The loss on impairment / retirement of fixed assets for 2019 was $4.9 million compared with $10.2 million for 2018. The decrease was attributable to the retirement of a specific asset in the second quarter of 2018 and the impairment of two specific assets in the third quarter of 2018. A $0.6 million and $0.1 million gain on sale of investment was recognized for the liquidation of a preferred equity investment during the first quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter of 2018, respectively.
After the items above, operating income increased $18.9 million to $309.4 million for 2019 from operating income of $290.5 million for 2018.
Interest expense for 2019 increased $14.7 million due to interest incurred on the 2029 senior notes issued in late June 2019 and incremental revolving credit facility borrowings during 2019. We recognized a $1.1 million loss on early debt extinguishment during the first quarter of 2018 in connection with amending our 2017 Credit Agreement. The net effect of our swaps resulted in a $16.5 million charge to earnings for 2019 compared with a $7.4 million charge to earnings for 2018. The difference reflected changes in fair market value movements in our swap portfolio offset by 2018 amortization of amounts in other comprehensive income for our de-designated swaps. We also recognized a $21.1 million net benefit to earnings for foreign currency gains and
losses in 2019 compared with a $36.3 million net charge to earnings for 2018. Both amounts primarily represented remeasurement of the U.S.-dollar denominated debt recorded at our Canadian entity from the U.S.-dollar to the legal entity's functional currency.
For 2019, a provision for taxes of $42.8 million was recorded to account for PTP taxes and federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. This compared with a provision for taxes recorded for 2018 of $34.7 million. The increase in provision for taxes was attributable to a $9.9 million tax benefit in 2018 for the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Cash taxes paid in 2019 were $40.8 million compared to $42.2 million in 2018.
After the items above, net income for 2019 totaled $172.4 million, or $3.03 per diluted limited partner unit, compared with net income of $126.7 million, or $2.23 per diluted unit, for 2018.
As stated previously, the results for 2019 included the results of the Schlitterbahn parks from the July 1, 2019 acquisition date. Comparing 2019 and 2018 on a same-park basis, net revenues increased by $83.8 million, or 6%, to $1,432.4 million. The increase reflected the impact of a 1.3 million-visit increase in attendance to 27.2 million visits and a $0.44 increase in in-park per capita spending to $48.13 on a same-park basis. The increase in attendance, particularly season pass visitation, was driven by strong season pass sales, favorable third quarter weather conditions and the introduction of new immersive events, including the inaugural WinterFest at Canada's Wonderland. The increase in in-park per capita spending was attributable to higher guest spending in food and beverage driven by the continued investment in our food and beverage offerings and in extra-charge products, particularly front-of-line products, driven by higher attendance levels. Out-of-park revenues increased $11.5 million to $163.7 million on a same-park basis largely due to an increase in online transaction fees charged to customers and the acquisition of the Sawmill Creek Resort at Cedar Point. Amounts remitted to outside parties under concessionaire arrangements increased $2.8 million to $42.2 million on a same-park basis, reflecting higher attendance and food and beverage demand.
Operating costs and expenses on a same-park basis increased by $70.7 million, or 8%, to $963.1 million. The increase was the result of an $8.6 million increase in COGS, a $37.8 million increase in operating expenses and a $24.2 million increase in SG&A expense on a same-park basis. COGS as a percentage of food, merchandise, and games net revenue was comparable. Operating expenses grew by $37.8 million primarily due to increased labor costs for seasonal, full-time and maintenance labor largely driven by planned wage and rate increases and related benefits, as well as incremental operating costs associated with new and expanded immersive events, including the inaugural WinterFest at Canada's Wonderland. The $24.2 million increase in SG&A expense was attributable to $7.2 million of acquisition-related costs, increased transaction fees related to higher sales volume, increased full-time wages, higher technology related costs, and an increase in marketing expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.2 million to $167.8 million on a same-park basis due to growth in capital improvements and the change in estimated useful lives for a series of specific assets in anticipation of future disposal.
After the same-park basis fluctuations described above, and the fluctuations of loss on impairment / retirement of fixed assets and gain on sale of investment, which were not materially impacted by the acquisition of the Schlitterbahn parks, operating income on a same-park basis increased $6.9 million. The fluctuations in interest expense, net effect of swaps, loss on early debt extinguishment, foreign currency (gain) loss, and provision for taxes on a same-park basis were not materially impacted by the acquisition of the Schlitterbahn parks. After these items, net income on a same-park basis increased $33.7 million to $160.4 million for 2019.
For 2019, Adjusted EBITDA increased $36.9 million to $504.7 million from $467.8 million for 2018. Adjusted EBITDA on a same-park basis increased $21.2 million, or 5%, due to increased net revenues driven by higher attendance, in-park per capita spending and out-of-park revenues offset by higher expenses, particularly for planned increases in labor and operating supply costs and variable costs associated with higher attendance, such as COGS and transaction fees. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2019 decreased 50 basis points ("bps") compared with our Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin on a same-park basis decreased 60 bps due to the planned expense increases in labor and operating supply costs, including costs for new facilities and immersive events. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were computed in the same manner on a same-park basis (3).
(3) Adjusted EBITDA for 2019 excluding the Schlitterbahn parks' results was calculated as net income of $160.4 million plus interest expense of $100.4 million, interest income of $2.0 million, provision for taxes of $42.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $167.8 million, net effect of swaps charge of $16.5 million, non-cash foreign currency gain of $21.1 million, non-cash equity compensation expense of $12.4 million, loss on impairment / retirement of fixed assets of $4.7 million, and acquisition-related costs of $7.2 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity typically include cash from operating activities, funding from our long-term debt obligations and existing cash on hand. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically fund pre-opening operations with revolving credit borrowings. Revolving credit borrowings are typically reduced with our positive cash flow during the seasonal operating period. Our primary uses of liquidity typically include operating expenses, partnership distributions, capital expenditures, interest payments and income tax obligations.
Due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took steps in 2020 to secure additional liquidity and to obtain relief from certain financial covenants including the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes, amendment of our term debt and revolving credit agreement, reducing operating expenses, including labor costs, suspending capital expenditures, and suspending quarterly partnership distributions. Due to limited open operations during 2020, our 2020 liquidity needs were funded from cash on hand from the recently issued senior notes. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash on hand of $376.7 million and $359.1 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Based on this level of liquidity, we have concluded that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations and remain in compliance with our debt covenants at least through the first quarter of 2022 assuming partial operations in 2021.
In the long term, and as restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 are lifted and our properties are able to resume full operations, management is focused on pursuing business process efficiencies and cost savings opportunities identified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, optimizing the Company's organizational structure with an aim for margin expansion, and reducing the Company's leverage. Also, in the long term, management anticipates returning to historic annual capital expenditure investments of 9-10% of revenues. We have no material, long-term commitments for new rides and attractions. Management is also committed to reinstituting quarterly partnership distributions when it is appropriate to do so and it is permissible under the Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement and our other debt covenants.
In the short term, and as we prepare our properties for the 2021 operating season, we expect to invest $30-35 million in capital expenditures, specifically for essential compliance and infrastructure requirements, as well as the completion of select unfinished projects from 2020. Many new rides and attractions planned for the 2020 operating season have yet to be introduced to our guests. We may invest in additional capital expenditures over the 2021 operating season as conditions permit. Due to the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in 2020, we anticipate an increase in cash interest payments of $45 million in 2021 to approximately $175 million in annual cash interest. We are expecting to receive $55.4 million in tax refunds attributable to the net operating loss in 2020 being carried back to prior years in the United States and an additional $11.9 million in tax refunds attributable to net operating losses being carried back to prior years in Canada. We anticipate receiving these tax refunds in the fourth quarter of 2021. Also, in 2021, we anticipate cash payments for income taxes to range from $5 million to $10 million, exclusive of these tax refunds. We anticipate funding our 2021 liquidity needs from cash on hand and cash from operating activities.
As of the date of this Form 10-K, we anticipate that we will spend $40-50 million per month during the first quarter of 2021 as we prepare our parks for opening in the second quarter of 2021. Our estimate includes projected operating expenses, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, and interest payments. We have made significant estimates and assumptions to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including financial results in the near and long term. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. We have not provided a longer period estimate due to the volatility of the current operating environment.
Operating Activities
Net cash for operating activities in 2020 totaled $416.5 million compared with net cash from operating activities of $403.0 million in 2019. The variance was attributable to lower earnings as a result of the COVID-19 disruption. Net cash from operating activities in 2019 increased $52.3 million compared with 2018. The increase was driven primarily by higher season-long product sales for the subsequent operating season, an increase in accrued income taxes due to an increase in income before taxes and the timing of payments, and an increase in accrued interest due to the 2029 senior notes issued in 2019.
Cash interest payments totaled $130.4 million in 2020 compared with $85.6 million in 2019. The increase in cash interest payments from 2019 was attributable to the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes issuances during 2020 offset by less outstanding term debt in 2020 following a $463.3 million prepayment in the second quarter of 2020. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $1.8 million in 2020 compared with $40.8 million in 2019. The decrease in cash payments for income taxes from 2019 was attributable to an increase in pretax loss from our taxable subsidiaries, as well as expected benefits from the CARES Act.
Investing Activities
Net cash for investing activities in 2020 totaled $120.8 million, a decrease of $479.4 million compared with 2019. The decrease from 2019 was attributable to multiple causes. First, in 2020 and due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our capital spending by approximately $60 million from our initial capital expenditures budget to maintain flexibility and retain liquidity. Second, in 2019, net cash for investing activities included the acquisitions of the Schlitterbahn parks and Sawmill Creek Resort which totaled $270.2 million and the purchase of the land at California's Great America from the City of Santa Clara for $150.3 million. Net cash for investing activities in 2019 increased $410.5 million compared with 2018. The increase from 2018 was
attributable to the acquisitions of the Schlitterbahn parks and Sawmill Creek Resort and the purchase of the land at California's Great America in 2019.
Financing Activities
Net cash from financing activities in 2020 totaled $730.9 million, an increase of $460.4 million compared with 2019. The increase from 2019 was primarily attributable to the net cash proceeds from the April 2020 financing events and the issuance of the 2028 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the 2029 senior notes issuance in 2019. The increase from 2019 was somewhat offset by the suspension of quarterly partnership distributions following the first quarter 2020 partnership distribution. Net cash from financing activities in 2019 increased $487.0 million compared with net cash for financing activities in 2018. The increase from 2018 was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the 2029 senior notes issuance in 2019.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, our primary contractual obligations consisted of outstanding long-term debt agreements and related derivative agreements. Before reduction for debt issuance costs and original issue discount, our long-term debt agreements consisted of the following:
•$264 million of senior secured term debt, maturing in April 2024 under our Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement. The term debt bears interest at London InterBank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 175 bps, under amendments we entered into on March 14, 2018. The pricing terms for the amendment reflected $0.9 million of Original Issue Discount ("OID"). Following a $463.3 million prepayment during the second quarter of 2020, we do not have any required remaining quarterly payments. Therefore, we had no current maturities as of December 31, 2020.
•$1.0 billion of 5.500% senior secured notes, maturing in May 2025, issued at par. The 2025 senior notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens on the issuers' and the guarantors' assets that secure all the obligations under our credit facilities. Prior to May 1, 2022, up to 35% of the 2025 senior notes may be redeemed with net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a price equal to 105.500% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any. The 2025 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 1, 2022 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a "make-whole" premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date. Thereafter, the 2025 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed. The 2025 senior notes pay interest semi-annually in May and November.
•$450 million of 5.375% senior unsecured notes, maturing in June 2024, issued at par. The 2024 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed. The 2024 senior notes pay interest semi-annually in June and December.
•$500 million of 5.375% senior unsecured notes, maturing in April 2027, issued at par. The 2027 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to April 15, 2022 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a "make-whole" premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date. Thereafter, the 2027 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed. The 2027 senior notes pay interest semi-annually in April and October.
•$300 million of 6.500% senior unsecured notes, maturing in October 2028, issued at par. Prior to October 1, 2023, up to 35% of the 2028 senior notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a price equal to 106.500% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any. The 2028 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 1, 2023 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a "make-whole" premium together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date. Thereafter, the 2028 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed. The 2028 senior notes pay interest semi-annually in April and October, beginning April 1, 2021.
•$500 million of 5.250% senior unsecured notes, maturing in July 2029, issued at par. Prior to July 15, 2022, up to 35% of the 2029 senior notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a price equal to 105.250% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any. The 2029 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to July 15, 2024 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a "make-whole" premium together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date. Thereafter, the 2029 senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed. The 2029 senior notes pay interest semi-annually in January and July.
•No borrowings under the $375 million senior secured revolving credit facility under our Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement with a Canadian sub-limit of $15 million. $300 million of the revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 350 bps or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate ("CDOR") plus 250 bps and requires the payment of a 62.5 bps commitment fee per annum on the unused portion of the credit facilities. The remaining $75 million of the revolving
credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 300 bps or CDOR plus 200 bps and requires the payment of a 37.5 bps commitment fee per annum on the unused portion of the credit facilities. The $300 million revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in December 2023 and the $75 million revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in April 2022. The Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit. After letters of credit, which totaled $15.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and $15.4 million as of December 31, 2019, we had available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $359.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and $259.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Our letters of credit are primarily in place to backstop insurance arrangements. The maximum outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility was $140.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $150.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had four interest rate swap agreements that matured on December 31, 2020 and converted $500 million of variable-rate debt to a fixed rate of 4.39%. We have four additional interest rate swap agreements that convert the same notional amount of variable-rate debt to a fixed rate of 4.63% for the period December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2023. None of our interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges in the periods presented. As of December 31, 2020, the fair market value of our swap portfolio was a liability of $39.1 million compared with a liability of $23.2 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the total fair value of our swap portfolio was classified as long-term and recorded in "Derivative Liability" within the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, $5.1 million of the fair value of our swap portfolio was classified as current and recorded in "Other accrued liabilities", and $18.1 million was classified as long-term and recorded in "Derivative Liability" within the consolidated balance sheet.
The Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement includes (i) a Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of 4.50x Total First Lien Senior Secured Debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA starting with the first quarter of 2022, which will step down to 4.00x in the second quarter of 2023 and which will step down further to 3.75x in the third quarter of 2023, with the covenant calculations for the first, second, and third quarters in 2022 to include Consolidated EBITDA from the second, third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 in lieu of the Consolidated EBITDA for the corresponding quarters in 2021 ("Deemed EBITDA Quarters"), (ii) a requirement that we maintain a minimum liquidity level of at least $125 million, tested at all times, until the earlier of December 31, 2022 or the termination of the Additional Restrictions Period (which generally includes the period from the effective date of the Second Amendment until the delivery of the compliance certificate for the fourth quarter of 2022), (iii) a suspension of certain restricted payments, including partnership distributions, under the Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement until the termination of the Additional Restrictions Period. We may terminate the Additional Restrictions Period prior to December 31, 2022 by achieving compliance with the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio covenant as of the end of a fiscal quarter without giving effect to Deemed EBITDA Quarters for any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants under the Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement.
Our fixed rate note agreements include Restricted Payment provisions, which could limit our ability to pay partnership distributions. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2024 senior notes, which includes the most restrictive of these Restricted Payments provisions under our fixed rate note agreements, if our pro forma Total-Indebtedness-to-Consolidated-Cash-Flow Ratio is greater than 5.00x, we can still make Restricted Payments of $60 million annually so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. If our pro forma Total-Indebtedness-to-Consolidated-Cash-Flow Ratio is less than or equal to 5.00x, we can make Restricted Payments up to our Restricted Payment pool. Our pro forma Total-Indebtedness-to-Consolidated-Cash-Flow Ratio was greater than 5.00x as of December 31, 2020.
As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise.
Financial and Non-Financial Disclosure About Issuers and Guarantors of our Registered Senior Notes
As discussed within the Long-Term Debt footnote at Note 8, we have issued five tranches of fixed rate senior notes: the 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028 and 2029 senior notes (“senior notes”). The 2024, 2027 and 2029 senior notes (the “registered senior notes”) have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The 2025 and 2028 senior notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Cedar Fair, L.P., Canada's Wonderland Company ("Cedar Canada"), and Magnum Management Corporation ("Magnum") are the co-issuers of the 2024 senior notes. Cedar Fair, L.P., Cedar Canada, Magnum, and Millennium Operations LLC (“Millennium”) are the co-issuers of the 2027 and 2029 senior notes. Our senior notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each 100% owned subsidiary of Cedar Fair (other than the co-issuers). There are no non-guarantor subsidiaries. A full listing of the issuers and guarantors of our registered senior notes can be found within Exhibit 22, and additional information with respect to our registered senior notes and the related guarantees follows.
The 2024, 2027 and 2029 senior notes each rank equally in right of payment with all of each issuer’s existing and future senior unsecured debt, including the other registered senior notes and the 2028 senior notes. However, the 2024, 2027 and 2029 senior notes are ranked effectively junior to our secured debt under the Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement and the 2025 senior notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
In the event that the co-issuers (except for Cedar Fair, L.P.) or any subsidiary guarantor is released from its obligations under our senior secured credit facilities (or the Third Amended 2017 Credit Agreement), such entity will also be released from its obligations under the registered senior notes. In addition, the co-issuers (except for Cedar Fair, L.P.) or any subsidiary guarantor can be released from its obligations under the 2024, 2027 and 2029 senior notes under the following circumstances, assuming the associated transactions are in compliance with the applicable provisions of the indentures governing the 2024, 2027 and 2029 senior notes: i) any direct or indirect sale, conveyance or other disposition of the capital stock of such entity following which the entity ceases to be a direct or indirect subsidiary of Cedar Fair or a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such entity; ii) if such entity is dissolved or liquidated; iii) if we designate such entity as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; iv) upon transfer of such entity in a qualifying transaction if following such transfer the entity ceases to be a direct or indirect Restricted Subsidiary of Cedar Fair or is a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a guarantor under any credit facility; or v) in the case of the subsidiary guarantors, upon a discharge of the indenture or upon any legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the indenture.
The obligations of each guarantor are limited to the extent necessary to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. This provision may not, however, protect a guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. If a guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness of the guarantor, and depending on the amount of such indebtedness, could reduce the guarantee to zero. Each guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a guarantee is entitled to a pro rata contribution from each other guarantor based on the respective net assets of the guarantors.
The following tables provide summarized financial information for each of our co-issuers and guarantors of the 2024, 2027 and 2029 senior notes. We have presented each entity that is a co-issuer of any series of the registered senior notes separately. The subsidiaries that guarantee the 2027 and 2029 senior notes are presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in such guarantor subsidiary group eliminated. Intercompany balances and transactions between the co-issuers and guarantor subsidiaries have not been eliminated. The subsidiaries that guarantee the 2024 senior notes include the guarantor subsidiary group, as well as Millennium. Millennium is a co-issuer under the 2027 and 2029 senior notes and a guarantor under the 2024 senior notes. There are no non-guarantor subsidiaries.
(1) With respect to the 2024 senior notes, if the financial information presented for Millennium was combined with that of the other guarantor subsidiaries that have been presented on a combined basis, the following additional intercompany balances and transactions between Millennium and such other guarantor entities would be eliminated: Non-Current Assets - $2,201.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and $2,141.8 million as of December 31, 2019; and Net revenues - $130.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and $121.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Combined amounts for all guarantors of the 2024 senior notes for all other line items within the table would be computed by adding the amounts in the Millennium and Guarantor Subsidiaries columns.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in Canada, and from time to time, on imported rides and equipment. The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.
We manage interest rate risk using a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt, interest rate swaps that fix our variable-rate long-term debt, and variable-rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Translation exposures with regard to our Canadian operations are not hedged.
None of our interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedging instruments. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or were de-designated are reported as "Net effect of swaps" in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
As of December 31, 2020, on an adjusted basis after giving effect to the impact of interest rate swap agreements, all of our outstanding long-term debt represented fixed-rate debt except for revolving credit borrowings. Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately $14.6 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in 30-day LIBOR on our variable-rate debt (including term debt and not considering the impact of our interest rate swaps) would lead to an increase of approximately $2.8 million in cash interest costs over the next twelve months.
Assuming a hypothetical 100 bps increase in 30-day LIBOR, the amount of net cash interest paid on our derivative portfolio would decrease by $2.6 million over the next twelve months.
A uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would result in a $2.9 million decrease in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.
