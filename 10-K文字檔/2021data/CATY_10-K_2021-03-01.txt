Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
General
The following discussion is intended to provide information to facilitate the understanding and assessment of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries. It should be read in conjunction with this Annual Report and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and "Risk Factors Summary." Actual results could differ materially because of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors,” under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
The Bank offers a wide range of financial services. As of the filing date of this report, the Bank operates 25 branches in Southern California, 13 branches in Northern California, 10 branches in New York State, four branches in Washington State, three branches in Illinois, two branches in Texas, one branch in Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Jersey, one branch in Hong Kong, and a representative office in Beijing, in Shanghai, and in Taipei. The Bank is a commercial bank, servicing primarily individuals, professionals, and small to medium-sized businesses in the local markets in which its branches are located.
The financial information presented herein includes the accounts of the Bancorp, its subsidiaries, including the Bank, and the Bank’s consolidated subsidiaries. All material transactions between these entities are eliminated.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Certain accounting policies that are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management believes the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements:
Allowance for Credit Losses
The determination of the amount of the provision for credit losses charged to operations reflects management’s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans, changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management, changes in the volume and severity of past due, non-accrual, and adversely classified or graded loans, changes in the quality of the loan review system, changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans, the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and the effect of competition, legal and regulatory requirements, and other factors. The nature of the process by which we determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs when management believes the collectability of a loan is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. A weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults, and a higher level of non-performing assets, net charge-offs, and provision for loan losses in future periods.
The total allowance for credit losses consists of two components: specific allowances and general allowances. To determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components, we employ two primary methodologies, the individual loan review analysis methodology and the classification migration methodology. These methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of our allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. These methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio, and environmental factors which include trends in delinquency and non-accrual, and other significant factors, such as the national and local economy, the volume and composition of the portfolio, the strength of management and loan staff, underwriting standards, and the concentration of credit.
The Bank’s management allocates a specific allowance for “Impaired Credits,” in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Section 310-10-35. For non-Impaired Credits, a general allowance is established for those loans internally classified and risk graded Pass, Watch, Special Mention, or Substandard based on historical losses in the specific loan portfolio and a reserve based on environmental factors determined for that loan group. The level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management’s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance. The allowance for credit losses is discussed in more detail in “Risk Elements of the Loan Portfolio - Allowance for Credit Losses” below. Management has reviewed the foregoing critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Recent Developments: Impact of and Response to COVID-19 Pandemic
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 in the United States has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Many states, including California, New York, Washington, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Nevada and other states in which we have significant operations, have imposed restrictions on leisure, business, commercial and other activities and gatherings to seek to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly heightened the level of challenges, risks and uncertainties facing our Company and its operations, including the following:
●
Market interest rates have declined significantly and these reductions, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income, net interest margin and earnings.
●
We anticipate a potential slowdown in demand for our products and services, including the demand for traditional loans, although we believe the decline may be partially offset due to the new volume of PPP loans under the CARES Act and other governmental programs established in response to the pandemic.
●
The inability of our customers to meet their loan commitments due to job and other losses resulting from the pandemic could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and declining collateral values, resulting in losses to our Company.
Additional potential impacts arising from, and our anticipated responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic are set forth below. See also Item 1A Risk Factors.
Financial position and results of operations
Our financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic environment and uncertainty related to the pandemic, higher specific reserves for impaired loans and net charge-offs of $14.2 million during the year contributed to a $57.5 million provision for credit losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. While we have not yet experienced significant write-offs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as of December 31, 2020, the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic effects will continue to affect our estimate of our allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses. To the extent the impact of the pandemic is prolonged and economic conditions worsen or persist longer than forecast, such estimates may be insufficient and change significantly in the future. Our interest income may also be negatively impacted in future periods as we continue to work with our affected borrowers to defer payments, interest, and fees. Additionally, net interest margin may be reduced generally as a result of the low rate environment. These uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings, slow growth, and may result in deterioration of asset quality in our loan and investment portfolios.
The below table details our exposure to borrowers in industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic:
(1)
Balances capture credit exposures in the business segments that manage the significant majority of industry relationships. Balances consist of commercial real estate secured loans where the collateral consist of restaurants, hotels/motels or have a retail dependency.
While we have not experienced disproportionate impacts among our business segments as of December 31, 2020, borrowers in the industries detailed in the table above (and potentially other industries) could have greater sensitivity to the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19 with potentially longer recovery periods than other business lines.
Loan and lease modifications
We began receiving requests from our borrowers for loan and lease deferrals in March following the onset of the pandemic. Modifications include the deferral of principal payments or the deferral of principal and interest payments for terms generally 90 - 180 days. Requests are evaluated individually, and approved modifications are based on the unique circumstances of each borrower. We are committed to working with our clients to allow time to work through the challenges of this pandemic. At this time, it is uncertain what future impact loan and lease modifications related to COVID-19 difficulties will have on our financial condition, results of operations and reserve for loan and lease losses.
The CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, (“CAA”), permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and provides interpretive guidance as to the conditions that would constitute a short-term modification that would not meet the definition of a TDR. These conditions include the following (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2021 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. The Company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications and anticipates that it will continue to experience an increase in short-term modifications.
As of December 31, 2020, COVID-19 modifications outstanding include 78, or $40.7 million, in residential mortgage loans, with a weighted average loan to value of 53.9% that represented 1.0% of the total residential mortgage portfolio and 12, or $56.7 million, in commercial loan balances that represented 2.0% of total commercial loans.
The following table shows COVID-19 CRE loan and lease modifications outstanding by property type as of December 31, 2020.
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
As part of the CARES Act, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has been authorized to guarantee loans under the PPP through December 31, 2020 for small businesses who meet the necessary eligibility requirements in order to keep their workers on the payroll. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if borrowers, among other conditions, maintain their staff and payroll and if loan amounts are used to cover payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. PPP loans have a two to five year term and earn interest at a rate of 1%. We began accepting applications on April 3, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had processed 1,362 PPP loans with a current balance of $240.9 million and forgiven $23.3 million. We have begun accepting and processing PPP applications under the CAA. As of February 15, 2021, we have accepted $191.1 million in applications and funded $96.8 million of PPP loans under the CAA. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA and therefore we believe PPP loans generally do not represent a material credit risk.
Capital and liquidity
While we believe we have sufficient capital and do not anticipate any need for additional liquidity as of December 31, 2020, in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are prepared to take additional actions, as needed, to maintain strong capital levels and ensure the strength of our liquidity position. Such actions may include pledging additional collateral to increase our borrowing capacity with the FRB, if necessary. Our Board of Directors also will continue to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the appropriateness of declaring future dividends and the rate of any future dividends as well as any stock repurchases, in light of our capital and liquidity needs.
Asset impairment
At this time, as of December 31, 2020, we do not believe there exists any impairment to our goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived assets, right of use assets, or available-for-sale investment securities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is uncertain whether prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will result in future impairment charges related to any of the aforementioned assets. Continued and sustained declines in Bancorp’s stock price and/or other credit related impacts could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a write-down in the value of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Our processes, controls and business continuity plan
As a financial institution, we are considered an essential business and therefore continue to operate on a modified basis to comply with governmental restrictions and public health authority guidelines. The health and safety of our employees and customers is a major concern to our management. We are continuing to permit employees to work from home when feasible or, if working from one of our locations is required, to maintain appropriate social distancing and observe other health precautions. We have also taken such other actions as social distancing, restrictions on in-person meetings and conferences, Company travel restrictions and increased sanitary protocols. We believe these actions offer the best protection for our employees and customers, and enhance our ability to continue providing our banking services.
Through this time of disruption, we have remained open for business supporting our customers while implementing our business continuity plan to mitigate the risks of the spread of COVID-19 to our employees and customers. While physical access to our bank offices remains restricted, customer business is still being transacted through drive-up facilities, online, telephone or by appointment.
We believe that we are positioned to continue these business continuity measures for the foreseeable future, however, no assurances can be provided as these circumstances may change depending on the duration and severity of the pandemic.
Results of Operations
Overview
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported net income of $228.9 million, or $2.87 per diluted share, compared to net income of $279.1 million, or $3.48 per diluted share, in 2019, and net income of $271.9 million, or $3.33 per diluted share, in 2018. The $50.2 million decrease in net income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily the result of decreases in net interest income and increases in provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreases in income taxes. The return on average assets in 2020 was 1.22%, compared to 1.61% in 2019, and to 1.70% in 2018. The return on average stockholders’ equity was 9.70% in 2020, compared to 12.63% in 2019, and to 13.18% in 2018.

Net income available to common stockholders and key financial performance ratios are presented below for the three years indicated:
Net Interest Income
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
Net interest income decreased $22.8 million, or 4.0%, from $574.9 million in 2019 to $552.1 million in 2020. The decrease in net interest income was due primarily to the decrease in loan interest income, offset by decreases in interest expense from time deposits.
Average loans for 2020 were $15.5 billion, a $1.0 billion, or 6.9% increase from $14.5 billion in 2019. Compared with 2019, average residential mortgage loans increased $325.2 million, or 7.7%, average commercial mortgage loans increased $438.4 million, or 6.3%, average commercial loans increased $184.2 million, or 6.7%, and average real estate construction loans increased $44.8 million, or 7.7%. Average investment securities were $1.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $226.9 million, or 15.7%, from 2019. Average interest-bearing cash on deposits with financial institutions increased $707.0 million, or 279.1%, to $960.3 million in 2020 from $253.3 million in 2019.
Average interest bearing deposits were $12.5 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 8.7%, from $11.5 billion in 2019, primarily due to increases of $891.5 million, or 44.3%, in money market accounts, $301.2 million, or 23.3%, in interest bearing demand deposits, and $28.6 million, or 3.9%, in savings accounts, offset by decreases of $191.1 million, or 2.6%, in time deposits.
Interest income decreased $68.7 million, or 8.9%, from $769.3 million in 2019 to $700.6 million in 2020 primarily due to decreases in the rate of loans:
●
Changes in volume: Average interest-earning assets increased $1.5 billion, or 9.3%, to $17.7 billion in 2020, compared with the average interest-earning assets of $16.2 billion in 2019. Average loans increased $1.0 billion and average interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions increased $707.0 million in 2020 which contributed to the increase in interest income. Offsetting the above increases was a decrease of $226.9 million in average investment securities. The changes in volume contributed to interest income increase of $47.6 million.
●
Changes in rate: The average yield of interest-bearing assets decreased to 3.96% in 2020 from 4.74% in 2019. Decrease in rate on loans resulted in a decrease of $100.0 million interest income, decrease in rate on deposits with other financial institutions resulted in a decrease of $8.3 million interest income, and decrease in rate on investment securities resulted in a decrease of $7.8 million interest income. The changes in rate contributed to interest income decrease of $116.3 million.
●
Change in the mix of interest-earning assets: Average gross loans, which generally have a higher yield than other types of investments, comprised 87.6% of total average interest-earning assets in 2020, a decrease from 89.4% in 2019. Average investment securities comprised 6.9% of total average interest-bearing assets in 2020, a decrease from 8.9% in 2019.
Interest expense decreased by $45.9 million, or 23.6%, to $148.5 million in 2020, compared with $194.4 million in 2019, primarily due to decreased cost from time deposits, FHLB advances, and long-term debt. The overall decrease in interest expense was primarily due to decreases in rates on interest bearing deposits, volume decreases in long term debts and volume and rate decreases in other borrowings as discussed below:
●
Changes in volume: Average interest bearing deposits increased $1.0 billion, or 9.0%, offset by decreases of $53.8 million, or 14.2%, in average FHLB advances and other borrowings and decreases in average long term debt of $45.8 million, or 27.8%. The changes in volume caused an increase in interest expense of $1.3 million.
●
Changes in rate: The average costs of interest-bearing deposits, FHLB advances and other borrowings, and long-term debt decreased to 1.09% and 1.73% and increased to 4.86% in 2020 from 1.55%, 2.21%, and 4.76% in 2019, respectively. The changes in rate caused interest expense to decrease by $47.2 million.
●
Change in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities: Average interest-bearing deposits of $12.5 billion increased to 96.6% of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2020 compared to 95.5% in 2019. Offsetting the increase, average FHLB advances and other borrowings of $326.0 million decreased to 2.5% of total interest-bearing liabilities. Average long-term debt of $119.1 million decreased to 0.9% of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2020 compared to 1.4% in 2019.
Net interest margin, defined as net interest income to average interest-earning assets, was 3.12% in 2020 compared to 3.54% in 2019.
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
Net interest income increased $9.0 million, or 1.6%, from $565.9 million in 2018 to $574.9 million in 2019. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to the increase in loan interest income, offset by increases in interest expense from time deposits and other interest-bearing deposits.
Average loans for 2019 were $14.5 billion, a $1.2 billion, or 9.0% increase from $13.3 billion in 2018. Compared with 2018, average residential mortgage loans increased $652.7 million, or 18.3%, average commercial mortgage loans increased $398.5 million, or 6.1%, average commercial loans increased $201.4 million, or 7.9%, and average real estate construction loans decreased $21.8 million, or 3.6%. Average investment securities were $1.4 billion in 2019, an increase of $97.9 million, or 7.3%, from 2018. Average interest-bearing cash on deposits with financial institutions decreased $23.7 million, or 8.6%, to $253.3 million in 2019 from $277.0 million in 2018.
Average interest bearing deposits were $11.5 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 10.6%, from $10.4 billion in 2018, primarily due to increases of $1.4 billion, or 23.7%, in time deposits, offset by decreases of $188.5 million, or 8.6%, in money market accounts, $98.6 million, or 7.1%, in interest bearing demand deposits, and $61.0 million, or 7.7%, in savings accounts.
Interest income increased $81.3 million, or 11.8%, from $688.0 million in 2018 to $769.3 million in 2019 primarily due to increases in the volume of loans:
●
Changes in volume: Average interest-earning assets increased $1.3 billion, or 8.7%, to $16.2 billion in 2019, compared with the average interest-earning assets of $14.9 billion in 2018. Average loans increased $1.2 billion and average investment securities increased $97.9 million in 2019 which contributed to the increase in interest income. Offsetting the above increases was a decrease of $23.7 million in interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions. The increase of $81.3 million in interest income resulted primarily from a $61.6 million increase in interest income from the loan volume increase and a $2.2 million increase in interest income from investment securities volume increase, offset by a $197 thousand decrease in interest income due to volume decrease from interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions.
●
Changes in rate: The average yield of interest-bearing assets increased to 4.74% in 2019 from 4.61% in 2018. Increase in rate on loans contributed $15.6 million to interest income, increase in rate on deposits with other financial institutions contributed $391 thousand to interest income, and increase in rate on investment securities contributed $2.3 million to interest income. The changes in rate contributed to interest income increase of $17.9 million.
●
Change in the mix of interest-earning assets: Average gross loans, which generally have a higher yield than other types of investments, comprised 89.4% of total average interest-earning assets in 2019, an increase from 89.0% in 2018. Average investment securities comprised 8.9% of total average interest-bearing assets in 2019, a decrease from 9.0% in 2018.
Interest expense increased by $72.3 million, or 59.2%, to $194.4 million in 2019, compared with $122.1 million in 2018, primarily due to increased cost from time deposits, other deposits, and FHLB advances, offset by decreases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The overall increase in interest expense was primarily due to increases in both volume and rates in interest bearing deposits, rate increases in long term debts and volume and rate increases in other borrowings offset by decreases in both volume and rate on securities sold under agreements to repurchase and volume decreases in long term debt as discussed below:
●
Changes in volume: Average interest bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 10.6%, and average FHLB advances and other borrowings increased $126.1 million, or 49.7%, offset by decreases in average long term debt of $29.1 million, or 15.0%, and decreases in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $49.6 million, or 100.0%. The changes in volume caused an increase in interest expense of $24.0 million.
●
Changes in rate: The average costs of interest-bearing deposits, FHLB advances and other borrowings, and long-term debt increased to 1.55%, 2.21% and 4.76% in 2019 from 1.03%, 1.98%, and 4.49% in 2018, respectively. The changes in rate caused interest expense to increase by $48.3 million.
●
Change in the mix of interest-bearing liabilities: Average interest-bearing deposits of $11.5 billion increased to 95.5% of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2019 compared to 95.4% in 2018. Average FHLB advances and other borrowings of $379.8 million increased to 3.2% of total interest-bearing liabilities. Offsetting the increase, average securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased to 0.0% of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2019 compared to 0.5% in 2018 and average long-term debt of $165.0 million decreased to 1.4% of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2019 compared to 1.8% in 2018.
Net interest margin, defined as net interest income to average interest-earning assets, was 3.54% in 2019 compared to 3.79% in 2018.
The following table sets forth information concerning average interest-earning assets, average interest-bearing liabilities, and the average yields and rates paid on those assets and liabilities in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Average outstanding amounts included in the table are daily averages.
(1)
Yields and amounts of interest earned include loan fees. Non-accrual loans are included in the average balance.
(2)
Calculated by dividing net interest income by average outstanding interest-earning assets.
Net Interest Income - Changes Due to Rate and Volume (1)
(1)
Changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to changes due to volume and changes due to rate.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses represents the charge against current earnings that is determined by management, through a credit review process, as the amount needed to maintain an allowance for loan losses and an allowance for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments that management believes to be sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio and credit commitments. The Bank recorded a provision of $57.5 million for credit losses in 2020 compared with a reversal of $7.0 million in 2019, and a reversal of $4.5 million in 2018. Net charge-offs for 2020 were $14.2 million, or 0.09% of average loans, compared to net recoveries for 2019 of $7.8 million, or 0.05% of average loans, and net recoveries for 2018 of $3.6 million, or 0.03% of average loans.
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 4.5%, to $42.8 million for 2020, from $44.8 million for 2019, compared to $31.7 million for 2018. Non-interest income includes depository service fees, letters of credit commissions, securities gains (losses), gains (losses) from loan sales, gains from sale of premises and equipment, gains on acquisition, and other sources of fee income. These other fee-based services include wire transfer fees, safe deposit fees, fees on loan-related activities, fee income from our Wealth Management division, and foreign exchange fees.
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
The decrease in non-interest income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to a $6.9 million decrease in net gains from equity securities, offset in part by a $2.5 million increase in gain on low income housing, a $1.5 million increase in gain on sales of securities, and a $1.3 million increase in fees and commissions income from wealth management.
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
The increase in non-interest income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to a $8.5 million increase in net gains from equity securities, and a $3.3 million increase in fees and commissions income from wealth management.
Non-interest Expense
Non-interest expense includes expenses related to salaries and benefits of employees, occupancy expenses, marketing expenses, computer and equipment expenses, amortization of core deposit intangibles, amortization of investment is affordable housing and alternative energy partnerships, and other operating expenses.
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
Non-interest expense totaled $283.5 million in 2020 compared to $277.3 million in 2019. The increase of $6.2 million, or 2.2%, in non-interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a combination of the following:
●
Amortization of investments in affordable housing and alternative energy partnerships increased $18.5 million, or 46.5%.
●
Salaries and employee benefits decreased $5.3 million, or 4.1%.
●
OREO expenses decreased $4.2 million.
●
Marketing expenses decreased $2.4 million, or 31.1%.
The efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses plus non-interest income, increased to 47.65% in 2020 compared to 44.75% in 2019 due primarily to an increase in non-interest expense and lower net interest income as explained above.
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
Non-interest expense totaled $277.3 million in 2019 compared to $264.4 million in 2018. The increase of $12.9 million, or 4.9%, in non-interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a combination of the following:
●
Salaries and employee benefits increased $4.8 million, or 3.9%, due primarily to higher salaries and benefits and additional employee costs due in part to the hiring of additional personnel.
●
Provision for unfunded commitment expenses increased by $3.9 million.
●
OREO expenses increased $1.8 million.
●
FDIC and State assessments expenses increased $1.6 million.
●
Occupancy expenses increased $1.3 million, or 6.4%.
The efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses plus non-interest income, increased to 44.75% in 2019 compared to 44.25% in 2018 due primarily to an increase in non-interest expense, offset in part by higher net interest income as explained above.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $25.1 million in 2020, compared to $70.2 million in 2019, and $65.8 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 9.9% for 2020, 20.1% for 2019, and 19.5% for 2018. The effective tax rate for 2020 includes alternative energy, low-income housing and other tax credits totaling $56.5 million. The effective tax rate for 2019 includes alternative energy, low-income housing and other tax credits totaling $39.6 million.
Our tax returns are open for audits by the Internal Revenue Service back to 2017 and by the California Franchise Tax Board back to 2016. The audit by the Internal Revenue Service for 2017 was completed in July 2020 and did not have an impact on income tax expense. From time to time, there may be differences of opinion with respect to the tax treatment accorded transactions. When, and if, such differences occur, and the related tax effects become probable and estimable, such amounts will be recognized.
Financial Condition
Total assets were $19.0 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $949.0 million, or 5.2%, from $18.1 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of $865.9 million in short-term investments and interest bearing deposits, and an increase of $523.7 million in net loans, offset by a decrease of $419.6 million in securities available for sale and equity securities.
Investment Securities
Investment securities were $1.0 billion and represented 5.4% of total assets at December 31, 2020, compared with $1.5 billion and 8.0% of total assets at December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the carrying value of our portfolio of securities for each of the past two years:
ASC Topic 320 requires an entity to assess whether it has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, an entity must recognize an other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) to its investment securities. If an entity does not intend to sell the debt security and will not be required to sell the debt security, the entity must consider whether it will recover the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, OTTI shall be considered to have occurred. OTTI is then separated into the amount of the total impairment related to credit losses and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors. An entity determines the impairment related to credit losses by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. OTTI related to the credit loss is thereafter recognized in earnings. OTTI related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. OTTI not related to the credit loss for a held-to-maturity security should be recognized separately in a new category of other comprehensive income and amortized over the remaining life of the debt security as an increase in the carrying value of the security only when the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis. The Company has both the ability and the intent to hold and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell those securities with unrealized losses before recovery of their amortized cost basis.
The temporarily impaired securities represented 17.9% of the fair value of investment securities as of December 31, 2020. Unrealized losses for securities with unrealized losses for less than twelve months represented 0.31%, and securities with unrealized losses for twelve months or longer represented 2.10%, of the historical cost of these securities as of December 31, 2020. Unrealized losses on these securities generally resulted from increases in interest rates or spreads subsequent to the date that these securities were purchased.
Total unrealized losses of $1.5 million at December 31, 2020, were primarily caused by increases in interest rates or the widening of credit and liquidity spreads since the dates of acquisition. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuers to settle the security at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment.
At December 31, 2020, management believed the impairment was temporary and, accordingly, no impairment loss on debt securities has been recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of its debt securities and has no intent to sell and believes it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell available-for-sale debt securities that have declined below their cost before their anticipated recovery.
The tables below show the fair value and unrealized losses of the temporarily impaired securities in our investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019:
The scheduled maturities and taxable-equivalent yields by security type are presented in the following table:
(1)
Securities reflect stated maturities and do not reflect the impact of anticipated prepayments.
Equity Securities
The adoption of ASU 2016-01 resulted in approximately $8.6 million being reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings, representing an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a net loss of $1.1 million due to the decrease in fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values, compared to a net gain of $5.7 million in 2019. Equity securities were $23.7 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $28.0 million as of December 31, 2019.
Loans
Loans represented 87.6% of average interest-earning assets during 2020, compared with 89.4% during 2019. Gross loans increased by $568.9 million, or 3.8%, to $15.6 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $15.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in gross loans was primarily attributable to the following:
•
Commercial mortgage loans increased $279.8 million, or 3.8%, to $7.6 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $7.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Total commercial mortgage loans accounted for 48.3% of gross loans at December 31, 2020, compared to 48.3% at December 31, 2019. Commercial mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial retail properties, shopping centers, owner-occupied industrial facilities, office buildings, multiple-unit apartments, hotels, and multi-tenanted industrial properties, and are typically secured by first deeds of trust on such commercial properties.
•
Total residential mortgage loans increased by $56.8 million, or 1.4%, to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to the low level of interest rates, the originations of limited documentation mortgages, and loan purchases.
•
Commercial loans, including PPP loans, increased $58.1 million, or 2.1%, to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2019. Commercial loans consist primarily of short-term loans (typically with a maturity of one year or less) to support general business purposes, or to provide working capital to businesses in the form of lines of credit, trade-finance loans, loans for commercial purposes secured by cash, and SBA loans.
•
Real estate construction loans increased $99.6 million, or 17.2%, to $679.5 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $579.9 million at December 31, 2019.
Our lending relates predominantly to activities in the states of California, New York, Texas, Washington, Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, and Nevada. We also lend to domestic clients who are engaged in international trade. Loans outstanding in our branch in Hong Kong were $280.5 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $305.3 million as of December 31, 2019.
The classification of loans by type and amount outstanding as of December 31 for each of the past five years is presented below:
The loan maturities in the table below are based on contractual maturities as of December 31, 2020. As is customary in the banking industry, loans that meet underwriting criteria can be renewed by mutual agreement between us and the borrower. Because we are unable to estimate the extent to which our borrowers will renew their loans, the table is based on contractual maturities. As a result, the data shown below should not be viewed as an indication of future cash flows.
Contractual Maturity of Loan Portfolio
As of December 31, 2020
Deposits
The Bank primarily uses customer deposits to fund its operations, and to a lesser extent borrowings in the form of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, and other borrowings. The Bank’s deposits are generally obtained from the Bank’s geographic market area. The Bank utilizes traditional marketing methods to attract new customers and deposits, by offering a wide variety of products and services and utilizing various forms of advertising media. Although the vast majority of the Bank’s deposits are retail in nature, the Bank does engage in certain wholesale activities, primarily accepting deposits generated by brokers or Internet listing services. The Bank considers wholesale deposits to be an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship and, as such, their levels are determined by management’s decisions as to the most economic funding sources. Brokered-deposits totaled $1.2 billion, or 7.2%, of total deposits, at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.3 billion, or 9.1%, at December 31, 2019.
The Bank’s total deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 9.5%, to $16.1 billion at December 31, 2020, from $14.7 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $1.1 billion, or 48.6%, increase in money market deposits, a $568.0 million, or 41.8%, increase in NOW deposits, a $493.6 million, or 17.2%, increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits offset by a $769.7 million, or 10.3% decrease in time deposits. The following table displays the deposit mix balances as of the end of the past three years:
Average total deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 9.8%, to $15.7 billion in 2020, compared with average total deposits of $14.3 billion in 2019.
The following table displays average deposits and rates for the past five years:
Management considers the Bank’s time deposits of $250 thousand or more, which totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020, to be generally less volatile than other wholesale funding sources primarily because approximately 92.3% of the Bank’s CDs of $250 thousand or more have been on deposit with the Bank for two years or more. Management monitors the CDs of $250 thousand or more portfolio to help identify any changes in the deposit behavior in the market and of the Bank’s customers.
Approximately 97.5% of the Bank’s CDs mature within one year as of December 31, 2020. The following tables display time deposits by maturity:
The following table displays time deposits with a remaining term of more than one year at December 31, 2020:
Borrowings
Borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Federal funds purchased, funds obtained as advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of San Francisco, and borrowings from other financial institutions.
The table below provides comparative data for securities sold under agreements to repurchase for the years indicated:
(1)
Average balances were computed using daily averages.
(2)
Highest month-end balance was January 2018.
As of December 31, 2020, there were no over-night borrowings from the FHLB compared to $450.0 million at a rate of 1.66% at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the advances from the FHLB were $150.0 million at a weighted average rate of 2.15% compared to $220.0 million at a weighted average rate of 2.26% as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, final maturity for the FHLB advances is $5.0 million in May 2021, $50.0 million in June 2021, $75.0 million in July 2021, and $20.0 million in May 2023.
Long-term Debt
We established three special purpose trusts in 2003 and two in 2007 for the purpose of issuing Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in their Subordinated Debentures to outside investors (“Capital Securities”). The proceeds from the issuance of the Capital Securities as well as our purchase of the common stock of the special purpose trusts were invested in Junior Subordinated Notes of the Company (“Junior Subordinated Notes”). The trusts exist for the purpose of issuing the Capital Securities and investing in Junior Subordinated Notes. Subject to some limitations, payment of distributions out of the monies held by the trusts and payments on liquidation of the trusts, or the redemption of the Capital Securities, are guaranteed by the Company to the extent the trusts have funds on hand at such time. The obligations of the Company under the guarantees and the Junior Subordinated Notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company and will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities and obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company has the right to defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes at any time or from time to time for a period of up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each deferral period. Under the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock or purchase or acquire any of its capital stock if it has deferred payment of interest on any Junior Subordinated Notes.
At December 31, 2020, Junior Subordinated Notes totaled $119.1 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.40%, compared to $119.1 million with a weighted average rate of 4.09% at December 31, 2019. The Junior Subordinated Notes have a stated maturity term of 30 years and qualify as Total Capital for these periods.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Guarantees, and Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2020. Payments for deposits and borrowings do not include interest. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts. Loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used, the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements.
In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Loan Commitments. We enter into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses.
Standby Letters of Credit. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to secure the obligations of a customer to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of an agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek reimbursement from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.
Capital Resources
Stockholders’ Equity
Total equity was $2.4 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $123.9 million, or 5.4%, from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to net income of $228.9 million, proceeds from dividend reinvestment of $9.8 million, stock based compensation of $5.6 million, and other comprehensive income of $3.0 million, offset by shares withheld related to net share settlement of RSUs of $1.9 million, purchase of treasury stock of $23.6 million, and common stock cash dividends of $98.7 million. The Company paid cash dividends of $1.24 per common share in 2020, $1.24 per common share in 2019, and $1.03 per common share in 2018.
On May 7, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to buy back up to $50.0 million of Bancorp’s common stock. In 2019, the Company repurchased 741,934 shares for $26.4 million, or $35.59 average cost per share under the May 2019 repurchase program. In December 2020, the Company completed the May 2019 stock repurchase program with the repurchase of 1,541,912 shares in total for approximately $50.0 million at an average cost of $32.43 per share of the Company’s common stock.
Capital Adequacy
Management seeks to retain our capital at a level sufficient to support future growth, protect depositors and stockholders, and comply with various regulatory requirements. The primary measure of capital adequacy is based on the ratio of risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.53%, total risk-based capital ratio of 15.47%, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 10.94%, calculated under the Basel III capital rules, continue to place the Company in the “well capitalized” category for regulatory purposes, which is defined as institutions with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 5%. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.51%, total risk-based capital ratio was 14.11%, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.83%.
A table displaying the Bancorp’s and the Bank’s capital and leverage ratios at December 31, 2020, and 2019, is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Dividend Policy
Holders of common stock are entitled to dividends as and when declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. We increased the common stock dividend from $.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, to $.21 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, to $.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, and to $.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. The amount of future dividends will depend on our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by our Board of Directors. The terms of our Junior Subordinated Notes also limit our ability to pay dividends. If we are not current in our payment of dividends on our Junior Subordinated Notes, we may not pay dividends on our common stock.
Substantially all of the revenues of the Company available for payment of dividends derive from amounts paid to it by the Bank. The Bank paid dividends to the Bancorp totaling $146.0 million during 2020, $239.0 million during 2019, and $127.8 million during 2018.
The Federal Reserve Board issued Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Letter SR-09-4 that states that bank holding companies are expected to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid.
Under California State banking law, the Bank may not without regulatory approval pay a cash dividend which exceeds the lesser of the Bank’s retained earnings or its net income for the last three fiscal years, less any cash distributions made during that period. Under this regulation, the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends to the Company immediately after December 31, 2020, was restricted to approximately $289.8 million. For additional information on statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of Bancorp to pay dividends to its shareholders and on the Bank to pay dividends to Bancorp, see “Item 1. Business-Regulation and Supervision - Dividends.”
Risk Elements of the Loan Portfolio
Non-performing Assets
Non-performing assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, non-accrual loans, and OREO. Our policy is to place loans on non-accrual status if interest and principal or either interest or principal is past due 90 days or more, or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely. After a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against current income and subsequent payments received are generally first applied towards the outstanding principal balance of the loan. Depending on the circumstances, management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and/or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. The loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and, in the opinion of management, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled.
Management reviews the loan portfolio regularly to see to identify problem loans. During the ordinary course of business, management may become aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of their loan agreements. Such loans are placed under closer supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non-accrual status, the need for an additional allowance for loan losses, and (if appropriate) partial or full charge-off.
Total non-performing portfolio assets increased $20.4 million, or 35.7%, to $77.6 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $57.2 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of $27.2 million in nonaccrual loans, offset by decreases of $5.3 million and $1.4 million in OREO and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, respectively.
As a percentage of gross loans, excluding loans held for sale, plus OREO, our non-performing assets decreased to 0.50% at December 31, 2020, from 0.38% at December 31, 2019. The non-performing portfolio loan, excluding loans held for sale, coverage ratio, defined as the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased to 237.3% at December 31, 2020, from 270.8% at December 31, 2019. The following table presents the breakdown of total non-accrual, past due, and restructured loans for the past five years:
Non-accrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans
The effect of non-accrual loans on interest income for the past five years is presented below:
As of December 31, 2020, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to those borrowers whose loans had been restructured, were considered impaired, or were on non-accrual status.
Non-accrual Loans
Total non-accrual portfolio loans were $67.7 million at December 31, 2020, increased $27.2 million, or 67.0%, from $40.5 million at December 31, 2019. The allowance for the collateral-dependent impaired loans is calculated by the difference between the outstanding loan balance and the value of the collateral as determined by recent appraisals, sales contracts, or other available market price information. The allowance for collateral-dependent impaired loans varies from loan to loan based on the collateral coverage of the loan at the time of designation as non-performing. We continue to monitor the collateral coverage, based on recent appraisals, on these loans on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance accordingly.
The following tables present the type of properties securing the non-accrual portfolio loans and the type of businesses the borrowers engaged in as of the dates indicated:
(1)
Real estate includes commercial mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, and residential mortgage loans and equity lines.

Real estate includes commercial mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, and residential mortgage loans and equity lines.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
A troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) is a formal modification of the terms of a loan when the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower. The concessions may be granted in various forms, including reduction of the stated interest rate, reduction of the amount of principal amortization, forgiveness of a portion of a loan balance or accrued interest, or an extension of the maturity date. Although these loan modifications are considered under ASC Subtopic 310-40 to be TDRs, the loans must have, pursuant to the Bank’s policy, performed under the restructured terms and have demonstrated sustained performance under the modified terms for six months before being returned to accrual status. The sustained performance considered by management pursuant to its policy includes the periods prior to the modification if the prior performance met or exceeded the modified terms. This would include cash paid by the borrower prior to the restructure to set up interest reserves.
A summary of TDRs by type of loan and by accrual/non-accrual status as of the dates indicated is shown below:
The activity within our TDR loans for 2020, 2019, and 2018 is shown below:
Impaired Loans
A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current circumstances and events. The assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are on non-accrual as a result of delinquency of over 90 days or receipt of information indicating that full collection of principal is doubtful, or when the loan has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring. Those loans with a balance less than our defined selection criteria, generally when a loan amount is $500,000 or less, are treated as a homogeneous portfolio. If loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent, we generally measure the impairment based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. If loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent, we generally measure the impairment by using the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral. We generally obtain an appraisal as appropriate to determine the amount of impairment at the date that the loan becomes impaired. The appraisals are based on “as is” or bulk sale valuations. To help ensure that appraised values remain current, we generally obtain an updated appraisal every twelve months from qualified independent appraisers. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded amount of the loan, we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. If an impaired loan is expected to be collected through liquidation of the collateral, the amount of impairment, excluding disposal costs (which range between 3% to 6% of the fair value, depending on the size of impaired loan), is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Non-accrual impaired loans are not returned to accruing status unless the unpaid interest has been brought current and full repayment of the recorded balance is expected or if the borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments of the scheduled amounts due and are continued to be reviewed for impairment until they are no longer reported as TDRs.
We identified impaired loans with a recorded investment of $95.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $75.9 million at December 31, 2019. The average balance of impaired loans was $91.4 million in 2020 and $102.6 million in 2019. We considered all non-accrual loans to be impaired. Interest recognized on impaired loans totaled $2.4 million in 2020 and $2.1 million in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, $44.6 million, or 65.9%, of the $67.7 million of non-accrual portfolio loans, excluding loans held for sale, was secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2019, $21.1 million, or 52.2%, of the $40.5 million of non-accrual portfolio loans, excluding loans held for sale, was secured by real estate. The Bank seeks to obtain current appraisals or other available market price information to assist in evaluating potential loss exposure.
At December 31, 2020, $6.4 million of the $166.5 million allowance for loan losses was allocated for impaired loans and $160.1 million was allocated to the general allowance. At December 31, 2019, $3.2 million of the $123.2 million allowance for loan losses was allocated for impaired loans and $120.0 million was allocated to the general allowance. In 2020, net loan charge-offs were $14.2 million, or 0.09%, of average loans, compared to net loan recoveries of $7.8 million, or 0.05%, of average loans in 2019.
The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, was 229.2% at December 31, 2020, compared to 262.6% at December 31, 2019. Non-accrual loans also include those TDRs that do not qualify for accrual status.
The following table presents impaired loans and the related allowance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Loan Interest Reserves
In accordance with customary banking practice, construction loans and land development loans generally are originated where interest on the loan is disbursed from pre-established interest reserves included in the total original loan commitment. Our construction and land development loans generally include optional renewal terms after the maturity of the initial loan term. New appraisals are typically obtained prior to extension or renewal of these loans in part to help determine the appropriate interest reserve to be established for the new loan term. Loans with interest reserves are underwritten to the same criteria, including loan to value and, if applicable, pro forma debt service coverage ratios, as loans without interest reserves. Construction loans with interest reserves are monitored on a periodic basis to gauge progress towards completion. Interest reserves are generally frozen if the Bank becomes aware that additional draws would result in a loan to value ratio that exceeds policy maximums based on collateral type. Our policy limits in this regard are consistent with supervisory limits and range from 65% in the case of land to 85% in the case of 1- to 4-family residential construction projects.
As of December 31, 2020, construction loans of $643.5 million were disbursed with pre-established interest reserves of $71.0 million compared to $550.0 million of such loans disbursed with pre-established interest reserves of $73.4 million at December 31, 2019. The balance for construction loans with interest reserves which have been renewed was $127.0 million with pre-established interest reserves of $4.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $129.2 million with pre-established interest reserves of $4.7 million at December 31, 2019. Land loans of $24.7 million were disbursed with pre-established interest reserves of $486 thousand at December 31, 2020, compared to $45.5 million land loans disbursed with pre-established interest reserves of $1.9 million at December 31, 2019. The balance for land loans with interest reserves which have been renewed was $942 thousand at December 31, 2020 with pre-established interest reserves of $58 thousand, compared to $1.7 million land loans with pre-established interest reserves of $2 thousand at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, the Bank had no loans on non-accrual status with available interest reserves. At December 31, 2020, $4.3 million of non-accrual non-residential construction loans had been originated with pre-established interest reserves. At December 31, 2019, $4.6 million of non-accrual non-residential construction loans had been originated with pre-established interest reserves. While loans with interest reserves are typically expected to be repaid in full according to the original contractual terms, some loans require one or more extensions beyond the original maturity. Typically, these extensions are required due to construction delays, delays in the sale or lease of property, or some combination of these two factors.
Loan Concentration
Most of our business activity is in markets with a concentration of Chinese-American individuals and businesses located in California; New York City; Dallas and Houston, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Nevada; New Jersey; and Maryland. We have no specific industry concentration, and generally our loans are collateralized with real property or other pledged collateral. We generally expect our loans to be paid off from the operating profits of the borrowers, refinancing by another lender, or through sale by the borrowers of the secured collateral.
The Federal banking regulatory agencies issued final guidance on December 6, 2006, regarding risk management practices for financial institutions with high or increasing concentrations of commercial real estate ("CRE") loans on their balance sheets. The regulatory guidance reiterates the need for sound internal risk management practices for those institutions that have experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, have notable exposure to specific types of CRE, or are approaching or exceeding the supervisory criteria used to evaluate the CRE concentration risk, but the guidance is not to be construed as a limit for CRE exposure. The supervisory criteria are: (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% of the institution's total risk-based capital, and (2) both total CRE loans represent 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's CRE loan portfolio has increased 50% or more within the last thirty-six months. The Bank’s loans for construction, land development, and other land represented 35% of total risk-based capital as of December 31, 2020, and 34% as of December 31, 2019. Total CRE loans represented 273% of total risk-based capital as of December 31, 2020, and 277% as of December 31, 2019, which were within the Bank’s internal limit of 400%, of total capital. See Part I - Item 1A - “Risk Factors” for a discussion of some of the factors that may affect us.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Bank maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level that the Bank’s management considers appropriate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks in the loan portfolio and off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments. Allowance for credit losses is comprised of allowances for loan losses and for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments. With this risk management objective, the Bank’s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans, and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for credit losses in a timely manner.
In addition, the Board of Directors of the Bank has established a written credit policy that includes a credit review and control system that it believes should be effective in ensuring that the Bank maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The Board of Directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process, including quarterly evaluations, and determines whether the allowance is appropriate to absorb losses in the credit portfolio. The determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses is based on management’s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectability when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses. The nature of the process by which the Bank determines the appropriate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment. Additions or reductions to the allowance for credit losses are made by charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. A weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality can result in an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, and defaults, and a higher level of non-performing assets, net charge-offs, and provision for loan losses. See Part I - Item 1A - “Risk Factors” for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance.
The allowance for loan losses was $166.5 million and the allowance for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments was $5.9 million at December 31, 2020, which represented the amount believed by management to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses, which is the sum of the allowances for loan losses and for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments, was $172.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $127.1 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $45.3 million, or 35.6%. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.10% of period-end gross loans and 237.3% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2020. The comparable ratios were 0.84% of period-end gross loans and 270.8% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2019.
The following table sets forth the information relating to the allowance for loan losses, charge-offs, recoveries, and the reserve for off-balance sheet credit commitments for the past five years:
Allowance for Credit Losses
(1)
Excluding loans held for sale
(2)
Excluding non-accrual loans held for sale
Our allowance for loan losses consists of the following:
•
Specific allowance: For impaired loans, we provide specific allowances for loans that are not collateral dependent based on an evaluation of the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate and for loans that are collateral dependent based on the fair value of the underlying collateral determined by the most recent valuation information received, which may be adjusted based on factors such as changes in market conditions from the time of valuation. If the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or, alternatively, a specific allocation will be established.
•
General allowance: The unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis. Segmentation is determined by loan types and common risk characteristics. The non-impaired loans are grouped into 19 segments: two commercial segments, ten commercial real estate segments, one residential construction segment, one non-residential construction segment, one SBA segment, one installment loans segment, one residential mortgage segment, one equity lines of credit segment, and one overdrafts segment. The allowance is provided for each segmented group based on the group’s historical loan loss experience aggregated based on loan risk classifications which take into account the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors, the prevailing value of the underlying collateral if collateral dependent, charge-off history, management’s knowledge of the portfolio, general economic conditions, environmental factors including the trends in delinquency and non-accrual, and other significant factors, such as the national and local economy, volume and composition of the portfolio, strength of management and loan staff, underwriting standards, and concentration of credit. Management also reviews reports on past-due loans to ensure appropriate classification. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management reevaluated and increased the look back period from five to eight years to capture historical loan losses from the last recession. The look back period is anchored from the first quarter of 2009 and has been extended through forty-eight quarters through the fourth quarter of 2020. The general allowance is affected by loan volumes, quarterly net charge-offs/recoveries and historical loss rates. In addition, risk factor calculations for pass rated loans included a specified loss emergence period and were determined based on five-year average of observed net losses, unless trends would indicate that a different weighting would be appropriate. These refinements maintained the Bank’s allowance at a level consistent with the prior quarter.
The table set forth below reflects management’s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to the total loans as of the dates indicated:
The allowance allocated to commercial loans was $68.7 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $57.0 million at December 31, 2019. The increase is due primarily to an increase in the allowance due to the continued deterioration in economic conditions related to COVID-19, and the impact on loss rates from charge-offs of commercial loans.
The allowance allocated to residential mortgage loans and equity lines was $17.7 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $13.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase is due primarily to continued deterioration in economic conditions related to COVID-19.
The allowance allocated to commercial mortgage loans increased was $49.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $33.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase is due primarily to continued deterioration in economic conditions related to COVID-19.
The allowance allocated for construction loans increased to $30.9 million at December 31, 2020, from $19.5 million at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the continued deterioration in economic conditions related to COVID-19 and increases in real estate construction loans.

Liquidity
Liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and customer credit needs, and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace. Our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits, proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments, repayments from securities and loans, Federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and advances from the FHLB. For December 2020, our average monthly liquidity ratio (defined as net cash plus short-term and marketable securities to net deposits and short-term liabilities) was 14.7% compared to 12.9% for December 2019.
The Bank is a shareholder of the FHLB, which enables the Bank to have access to lower-cost FHLB financing when necessary. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had an approved credit line with the FHLB of San Francisco totaling $4.8 billion. Total advances from the FHLB of San Francisco were $150.0 million and standby letter of credits issued by FHLB on the Company’s behalf were $531.7 million as of December 31, 2020. These borrowings bear fixed rates and are secured by loans. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2020, the Bank pledged $7.5 million of its commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window under the Borrower-in-Custody program. The Bank had borrowing capacity of $7.6 million from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window at December 31, 2020.
Liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets, which consist of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities available-for-sale and equity securities. At December 31, 2020, securities available-for-sale totaled $1.0 billion, with $22.7 million pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments. The remaining $1.0 billion was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings.
Approximately 98% of our time deposits mature within one year or less as of December 31, 2020. Management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the Bank’s marketplace. However, based on our historical runoff experience, we expect the outflow will not be significant and anticipate that the outflow can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits. Management believes all the above-mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity during the next twelve months for the Bank to meet its operating needs.
The business activities of the Bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the Bank and limited activities in other investments. The Bancorp obtains funding for its activities primarily through dividend income contributed by the Bank, proceeds from the issuance of the Bancorp common stock through our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the exercise of stock options. Dividends paid to the Bancorp by the Bank are subject to regulatory limitations. Management believes the Bancorp’s liquidity generated from its prevailing sources is sufficient to meet its operational needs.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This update requires an entity to use a broader range of reasonable and supportable (“R&S”) forecasts, in addition to historical experience and current conditions, to develop an expected credit loss estimate, referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, for financial assets and net investments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost.
The FASB issued additional ASUs containing clarifying guidance, transition relief provisions and minor updates to the original ASU. These include ASU 2018-19 (issued November 2018), ASU 2019-04 (issued April 2019), ASU 2019-05 (issued May 2019), ASU 2019-10 (issued November 2019), ASU 2019-11 (issued November 2019), ASU 2020-02 (issued February 2020) and ASU 2020-03 (issued March 2020). ASU 2016-13 and subsequent ASUs are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. This amendment is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.
Under the CECL approach management estimates the allowance for credit losses (or "ACL") using relevant available information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that vary by loan portfolio. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in gross domestic product, unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors.
Under the CECL methodology, quantitative and qualitative loss factors are applied to our population of loans on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. When loans do not share similar risk characteristics, the Company would evaluate the loan for expected credit losses on an individual basis. The Company evaluates loans for expected credit losses on an individual basis, if, based on current information and events, the loan does not share similar credit risk characteristics with other loans. When CECL is adopted, the Company may choose to measure expected credit losses on an individual loan basis by using one of the following three different loan valuation methods: (1) the present value of the expected future cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate, (2) the observable market price of the impaired loan or (3) the fair value of the collateral of a collateral-dependent loan less costs of sale. For loans that are not collateral-dependent, the Company will use the present value of future cash flows or the market value of the loan.
Under the Company’s CECL methodology, nine portfolio segments with similar risk characteristics are evaluated for expected loss. Six portfolios will be modeled using econometric models and three smaller portfolios are evaluated using a simplified approach. The six portfolios subject to econometric modeling include residential mortgages; commercial and industrial loans (“C&I”); construction loans; commercial real estate (“CRE”) for multifamily loans; CRE for owner-occupied loans; and other CRE loans. We will estimate the probability of default during the reasonable and supportable forecast period using separate econometric regression models developed to correlate macroeconomic variables to historical credit performance for each of the six loan portfolios from 2009 to 2019. Loss given default rates initially would be computed based on the net charge-offs recognized divided by the expected exposure at default of defaulted loans starting with the first quarter of 2009 to 2019. Both the econometric regression models and the expected exposure of default will be updated annually.
The Company’s CECL methodology will utilize an eight-quarter reasonable and supportable period (“R&S”), and a four-quarter transition period. Management will rely on multiple forecasts, blending them into a single loss estimate. We use economic forecasts from Moody’s Analytics in this process. Generally speaking, the blended scenario approach would include the Baseline forecast, the stronger near-term growth scenario and the Moderate Recession forecast. After the R&S period, the Company will revert to using long term loss rates for each of the six portfolios of loans.
The Company’s CECL methodology will estimate expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: (i) management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or (ii) the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
The simplified approach portfolios include Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOC’s”) and cash-secured loans, which could not be modelled econometrically, and provide for a forecast loss rate based on the forecasted economic factors during the first six quarters of the portfolio’s contractual life, transition loss rates for the next six quarters of the portfolio’s contractual life, and the long-term loss rate projected over the remainder of the portfolio’s contractual life.
Under the Company’s CECL methodology, the qualitative portion of the reserve on pooled loans represents management’s judgment of additional considerations to account for internal and external risk factors that are not adequately measured in the quantitative reserve. The qualitative loss factors consider idiosyncratic risk factors, conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, or other relevant factors to ensure the allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses. The qualitative reserves include reserves for policy exceptions, experience of management and staff, level of competition in the lending environment, weak risk identification, lack of historical experience with residential mortgage loans made to non-US residents, and the higher risk characteristics of purchased syndicated loans. An additional incremental qualitative adjustment includes an estimate for possible model error from the econometric models to estimate the reserves for the six loan pools described above. Current and forecasted economic trends and underlying market values for collateral dependent loans are generally considered to be included within the econometric models described above.
As provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (the “CARES Act”) and extended by the CAA, the Company has elected to delay its adoption of ASU 2016-13. Although the CAA permits a delay in the adoption of ASU 2016-13 until the date on which the national emergency related to the COVID-19 outbreak is terminated or January 1, 2022, whichever occurs first, the Company will be adopting ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2021. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company expects to recognize, as of January 1, 2021, a one-time cumulative effect adjustment through retained earnings of between $10.0 million to $12.0 million and expects to increase its allowance for credit losses by $13.0 to $15.0 million. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, the reserve for unfunded commitments under CECL is increased by approximately $500 thousand than under the incurred loss methodology. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s process for estimation of the ACL under the CECL model is substantially completed. The Company does not expect to record an ACL for AFS debt securities.
