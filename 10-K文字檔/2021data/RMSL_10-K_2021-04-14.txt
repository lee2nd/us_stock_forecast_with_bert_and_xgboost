ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We are a Nevada corporation formed on June 6, 2007. Our headquarters are in Tampa, FL. We have been engaged in our current business model since January 1, 2015.
We have experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, including in our current business model. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we ramp up our expansion, which likely will lead to additional losses, until such time that we approach profitability, or which there are no assurances. We have relied on equity financing to fund operations. There can be no guarantee that we will ever become profitable, or that adequate additional financing will be realized in the future or otherwise may be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our expansion efforts. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, of which there are no assurances.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,565,942 at December 31, 2020, had a net loss of $1,175,452 (including $127,500 of non-cash stock compensation and $832,885 in losses related to convertible debt, interest and discount amortization) and net cash used in operating activities of $335,293 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock and/or debt financing is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors over the next twelve months raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.
Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Revenues
We generated no revenues during our fiscal years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, professional fees decreased $18,535 or 30.9% to $41,525 compared to $60,060 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Professional fees consist mostly of accounting, audit and legal fees. The decrease of $18,535 in the current year is mainly attributed to a decrease in legal fees. In the prior year we incurred additional legal fees related to the preparation and filing of our Form 1-A.
Consulting expense was $5,000 compared to $54,720 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $49,720 or 90.9%. The decrease is due to the decrease in issuing common stock for services. In the prior year we granted common stock for total non-cash expense of $54,320. In addition, in the prior year we had a hired a consultant for investor relation and related services. We are no longer using those services in the current period. We issued no stock for services in the current year.
Compensation expense was $211,500 and $2,107,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the prior year we issued 25,000,000 common shares each to both our Chairman and CEO for services for total non-cash expense of $2,000,000. We also issued our Chairman 500,000 shares of series A preferred stock for total non-cash compensation expense of $20,000.
General and administrative expense was $211,819 and $119,504 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $92,315 or 79.9%. The increase in the current period can be largely attributed to an increase in depreciation of $31,657, development expense of $22,922, web design expense of $10,450 and investor relation expense of $20,390, all related to increased efforts to fully develop our product and bring it to market. We also had an increase in investor relation expense of $20,390, for assistance with our Offering Statement.
Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $705,608. Other income/expense includes $561,576 of debt discount amortization, a $350,986 loss on the issuance of convertible debt, an early payment penalty of $49,162 and a gain in the change of fair value of derivatives of $79,677. These are all expenses related to our convertible debt. We also incurred $49,958 of interest expense.
Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $1,546,484. Other expense includes $341,011 of debt discount amortization, a $1,575,107 loss on the issuance of convertible debt and a gain in the change of fair value of derivatives of $445,318. These are all expenses related to our convertible debt. We also incurred $55,693 of interest expense.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $1,175,452 as compared to a net loss of $3,888,468 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net loss was lower in the current period primarily due to the expense associated with the other non-cash expense from the issuance of convertible debt and common stock issued for services.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Net cash used in operating activities was $335,293 for year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we used cash of $236,036 in operating activities.
We used $36,710 and $96,874 on the purchase of property and equipment for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We received a net total of $366,656 from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted of $460,000 from proceeds from convertible debt and $75,000 from the sale of common stock. We repaid $165,000 of our convertible debt and $3,344 against other loans. We received a net total of $435,844 from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, including $439,000 from a convertible promissory note offset by repayment of related party loans of $3,156.
As of December 31, 2020, we have the following amounts due on our convertible debt.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On June 20, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to nonemployees (for example, service providers, external legal counsel, suppliers, etc.). Under the new standard, companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Meaning that companies will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC718 and forgo revaluing the award after this date. The Company has chosen to early adopt this standard. There has been no material impact on our financial statements as a result of adopting this standard.
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
