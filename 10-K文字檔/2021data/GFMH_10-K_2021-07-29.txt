Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting the Company.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Basis of Presentation
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: Estimated revenue of films. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer.
2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.
3. Determination of the transaction price.
4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. The Company allocates the entire transaction price to a single performance obligation.
The Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with all technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s rights system.
The Company will evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions when revenues are achieved. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices. The Company recognizes revenue from the distribution of its films on a net revenue basis as MarVista distributes the films to MarVista’s end customers.
For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $38,366 and $13,954, respectively, of recorded revenue.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable, if any are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will be based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations.
The Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carrying accounts receivable.
Films and Television Costs
The Company capitalizes production costs for films produced in accordance with ASC 926-20, “Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs”. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production based on the relative fair value of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. The Company evaluates its capitalized production costs annually and limits recorded amounts by its ability to recover such costs through expected future sales.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Stock Compensation
In accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), we measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. We apply this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 718. ASC No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees (“ASC 505”) defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the ASC 505.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We follow the provisions of ASC 820. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
We use fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value. These require management’s judgment.
Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports. For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments and long-term debt. Also, FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.
Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s investments and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.
● Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
● Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.).
● Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).
The Company’s adoption of FASB ASC Topic 825 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at April 30, 2021 and 2020. Assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature.
The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment.
Basic and diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares (including common stock subject to redemption) plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the reporting period. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
The total number of potential additional dilutive securities outstanding for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020 was none since the Company had net losses and any additional potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.
Concentrations, Risks, and Uncertainties
The Company did not have a concentration of business with suppliers constituting greater than 10% of the Company’s expenses during 2021 or 2020. In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, all of its revenues were from Mar Vista Entertainment LLC.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have evaluated new accounting pronouncements that have been issued and are not yet effective for us and determined that there are no such pronouncements expected to have an impact on our future financial statements.
Plan of Operations
The Company had a net income of $2,227 and a net loss of $30,671 for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and historical losses totaling $1,053,194. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s management plan to continue as a going concern revolves around its ability to execute its business strategy of distributing digital content, as well as raising the necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company.

We sold no shares in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As we move forward with our business plan, we will need to raise additional capital either through the sale of stock or funding from shares and or officers and directors to cover our cash needs through the end of the 2022 fiscal year.
