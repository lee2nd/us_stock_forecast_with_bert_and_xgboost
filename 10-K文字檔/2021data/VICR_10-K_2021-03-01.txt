ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
A discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2019, on pages 36-38
under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.
We design, develop, manufacture, and market modular power components and power systems for converting electrical power for use in electrically-powered devices. Our competitive position is supported by innovations in product design and achievements in product performance, largely enabled by our focus on the research and development of advanced technologies and processes, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry, materials, and packaging. Many of our products incorporate patented or proprietary implementations of high-frequency switching topologies enabling power system solutions that are more efficient and much smaller than conventional alternatives. Our strategy emphasizes demonstrable product differentiation and a value proposition based on competitively superior solution performance, advantageous design flexibility, and a compelling total cost of ownership. While we offer a wide range of alternating current (“AC”) and direct
current (“DC”) power conversion products, we consider our core competencies to be associated with 48V DC distribution, which offers numerous inherent cost and performance advantages over lower distribution voltages. However, we also offer products addressing other DC voltage standards (e.g., 380V for power distribution in data centers, 110V for rail applications, 28V for military and avionics applications, and 24V for industrial automation).
Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which our products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either “Advanced Products” or “Brick Products.” The Advanced Products category consists of our more recently introduced products, which are largely used to implement our proprietary Factorized Power Architecture™
(“FPA”), an innovative power distribution architecture enabling flexible, rapid power system design using individual components optimized to perform a specific conversion function.
The Brick Products category largely consists of our broad and well-established families of integrated power converters, incorporating multiple conversion stages, used in conventional power systems architectures. Given the growth profiles of the markets we serve with our Advanced Products line and our Brick Products line, our strategy involves a transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in our Advanced Products line and targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix,
high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in the mature market segments we serve with our Brick Products line with a high-mix,
low-volume
operational model.
The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Products, we generally serve large Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”), and their contract manufacturers, with sales currently concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which our products are used for voltage distribution on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure. We have established a leadership position in the emerging market segment for powering high-performance processors used for acceleration of applications associated with artificial intelligence (“AI”). Our customers in the AI market segment include the leading innovators in processor and accelerator design, as well as early adopters in cloud computing and high performance computing. We also target applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, industrial automation, instrumentation, test equipment, solid state lighting, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment). With our Brick Products, we generally serve a fragmented base of large and small customers, concentrated in aerospace and defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (notably in rail and heavy equipment applications). With our strategic emphasis on larger, high-volume customers, we expect to experience over time a greater concentration of sales among relatively fewer customers.
In June 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,769,231 shares of our Common Stock, at a price to the public of $65.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $109.7 million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and other general corporate purposes.
Our quarterly consolidated operating results can be difficult to forecast and have been subject to significant fluctuations. We plan our production and inventory levels based on management’s estimates of customer demand, customer forecasts, and other information sources. Customer forecasts, particularly those of OEM, ODM, and contract manufacturing customers to which we supply Advanced Products in high volumes, are subject to scheduling changes on short notice, contributing to operating inefficiencies and excess costs. In addition, external factors such as supply chain uncertainties, which are often associated with the cyclicality of the electronics industry, regional macroeconomic and trade-related circumstances, and force majeure
events (most
recently evidenced by the COVID-19
pandemic), have caused our operating results to vary meaningfully. Our quarterly gross margin as a percentage of net revenues may vary, depending on production volumes, average selling prices, average unit costs, the mix of products sold during that quarter, and the level of importation of raw materials subject to tariffs. Our quarterly operating margin as a percentage of net revenues also may vary with changes in revenue and product level profitability, but our operating costs are largely associated with compensation and related employee costs, which are not subject to sudden or significant changes.
Impact of COVID-19
Pandemic
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization designated the COVID-19
outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” (i.e., a health emergency requiring coordinated action by the governments of effected countries). On January 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency for the entire United States, thereby facilitating a nationwide public health response. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19
was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, an indication of its global severity. Governments worldwide have responded with measures intended to contain the further spread of COVID-19,
including mandatory closures of businesses, schools, and organizations.
On March 23, 2020, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ordered non-essential
businesses closed and prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people, extending the Commonwealth’s emergency declaration made on March 10, 2020. Our headquarters and primary manufacturing facility are located in Massachusetts. However, the Company is designated as essential by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, given our role in supporting industrial sectors considered “critical infrastructure.” As such, we have continued to operate at, or close to, full manufacturing capacity, although there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to operate at such levels of manufacturing capacity.
Widespread uncertainty associated with the pandemic has contributed to reduced business activity worldwide. As described further below, we experienced production constraints throughout 2020 that resulted in delays, inefficiencies, and higher costs, which, in the aggregate, had a detrimental influence on our financial results for the past four quarters. Given ongoing uncertainty, there is no assurance that our financial performance will not continue to be negatively influenced as a result of the pandemic.
Since early March 2020, we have taken actions intended to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, business partners, and suppliers. Following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, state and local health authorities, and existing internal crisis management policies, we developed and implemented comprehensive health and safety measures at all of our locations, including: establishing a central response team; distributing information and carrying out education initiatives; implementing social distancing requirements, including the installation of transparent panels to physically separate individuals when in close proximity; distributing breathing masks, disposable gloves, disinfectant wipes, and thermometers to employees; implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our manufacturing facility; extensive and frequent disinfecting of our workspaces; modifying our meal services to minimize physical contact; enabling work-from-home arrangements for those employees who do not need to be physically on premises to perform their work effectively; and suspending travel. We expect to maintain these measures until we determine the pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business, and we may take further actions we consider to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, business partners, and suppliers, or in response to further government mandates or requirements.
Rates of absenteeism associated with employee self-quarantine due to exposure to COVID-19
were steady at a satisfactory level through the third quarter of 2020, but rose in December. The productivity of our factory may be reduced if quarantine rates increase or if the number of employees diagnosed with COVID-19
requires further implementation of restrictive health and safety measures, including factory closure. As of the date of this report, absenteeism rates have improved, we continue to operate with three shifts in our factory, and, with few exceptions, our engineering, sales, and administrative personnel are working from the Company’s offices.
We are closely monitoring the operating performance and financial health of our customers, business partners, and suppliers, but an extended period of operational constraints brought about by the pandemic could cause financial hardship within our customer base and supply chain. Such hardship may continue to disrupt customer demand and limit our customers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Similarly, such hardship within our supply chain could continue to restrict our access to raw materials or services. Additionally, restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of cargo transport by ship or air, could result in higher costs and inbound and outbound delays. During 2020, we took steps to address certain supply chain risks, and we believe our actions mitigated those risks, particularly for the second half of the year; however, there are no assurances that those steps will continue to mitigate risks in 2021 and beyond.
Although there is uncertainty regarding the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our operational and financial results in the future, the Company’s high level of liquidity (supplemented by the approximately $109.7 million of net proceeds from the public offering of shares of our Common Stock during the second quarter of 2020), flexible operational model, existing raw material inventories, and increased use of second sources for critical manufacturing inputs together support management’s belief the Company will be able to effectively conduct business until the pandemic passes.
We are monitoring the rapidly changing circumstances, and may take additional actions to address COVID-19
risks as they evolve. Because much of the potential negative impact of the pandemic is associated with risks outside of our control, we cannot estimate the extent of such impact on our financial or operational performance, or when such impact might occur.
Recent Developments
On February 24, 2021, James A. Simms notified us of his decision to resign from his positions as our Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary effective June 30, 2021. Mr. Simms’ resignation is not related to our operations, policies, or practices, including our internal controls or other matters related to financial reporting. We have initiated a search for a new Chief Financial Officer, a process with which Mr. Simms will be assisting.
2020 Financial Highlights
•
Net revenues increased 12.8% to $296,576,000 for 2020, from $262,977,000 for 2019, primarily due to an overall 28.6% increase in bookings for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, principally due to an increase of 80.9% in new orders for Advanced Products.
•
Export sales, as a percentage of total revenues, represented approximately 64.4% in 2020 and 53.7% in 2019, principally reflecting the locations of OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers utilizing higher volumes of Advanced Products.
•
Gross margin increased to $131,447,000 for 2020, from $122,966,000 for 2019. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 44.3% for 2020 from 46.8% for 2019. Despite higher net revenues and gross margin dollars for the year ended December 31, 2020, gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an unfavorable change in product mix (i.e., a higher percentage of lower margin products were produced and shipped during the year ended December 31, 2020), a negative influence from production inefficiencies and cost variances associated with initial production volumes of new products, certain supply chain constraints associated with the COVID-19
pandemic, and higher tariff charges.
•
Backlog, representing the total of orders for products received for which shipment is scheduled within the next 12 months, was approximately $147,550,000 at the end of 2020, as compared to $104,164,000 at the end of 2019.
•
Operating expenses for 2020 increased $4,934,000, or 4.5%, to $114,079,000 from $109,145,000 for 2019, due to increases in research and development expenses of $4,328,000 and selling, general, and administrative expenses of $606,000. Compensation and related personnel costs closely track headcount and annual merit-based increases in salary and wages. However, certain other expenses, such as prototyping costs in research and development, or advertising and promotion costs associated with sales initiatives, can vary meaningfully period to period.
•
We reported net income for 2020 of $17,910,000, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14,098,000, or $0.34 per diluted share, for 2019. Diluted shares outstanding at year-end
2020 increased approximately 2.2 million over the prior year-end,
as a result of the June 2020 underwritten offering of Common Stock and employee exercise of stock options during the year.
•
In 2020, as a result of activities associated with our construction and capacity expansion, depreciation and amortization totaled $11,056,000, and capital expenditures were $28,653,000, compared to $10,334,000 and $12,485,000, respectively, for 2019.
•
Inventories increased by approximately $8,082,000, or 16.4%, to $57,269,000 at the end of 2020, as compared to $49,187,000 at the end of 2019, primarily due to an increase in raw materials of $9,972,000 to meet increasing demand, partially offset by an increase in reserves of $3,442,000.
The following table sets forth certain items of selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of net revenues for the years shown, ended December 31. This table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes contained elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and our associated judgments, including those related to inventories, income taxes, contingencies, and litigation. We base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We also have other policies we consider key accounting policies, (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
). However, the application of these other policies does not require us to make significant estimates and assumptions difficult to support quantitatively.
Inventories
We employ a variety of methodologies to evaluate inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or unmarketable, in order to write down that inventory to net realizable value. Our estimation process for assessing
net realizable value is based upon forecasted future usage which we derive based on backlog, historical consumption, and expected market conditions. For both Brick and Advanced product lines, the methodology used compares on-hand
quantities to forecasted usage and historical consumption, such that amounts of inventory on hand in excess of management’s estimate of expected future utility, are fully reserved. While we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand, due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in forecasting future usage, it is possible actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods.
Evaluation of the Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets
Significant management judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. We assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and past financial performance. While recent positive operating results, as a result of increases in bookings, caused the Company to be in a cumulative income position as of December 31, 2020, the Company faces uncertainties in forecasting its operating results due to the continued impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the Company’s supply chain, certain process issues with the production of Advanced Products and the unpredictability in certain markets. This operating uncertainty also makes it difficult to predict the availability and utilization of tax benefits over the next several years. As a result, management has concluded, at this time, is more likely than not the Company’s net domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized, and a full valuation allowance against all net domestic deferred tax assets is still warranted as of December 31, 2020. The valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences, changes in tax laws, and operating performance. If the positive quarterly earnings and increases in bookings continue, and the Company’s concerns about industry uncertainty and world events, including the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the Company’s supply chain, and process issues with the production of Advanced Products are resolved, and the amount of tax benefits the Company is able to utilize to the point that the Company believes future taxable income can be more reliably forecasted, the Company may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the near-term. Certain state tax credits, though, will likely never be released by the valuation allowance. If and when the Company determines the valuation allowance should be released (i.e., reduced), the adjustment would result in a tax benefit reported in that period’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, the effect of which would be an increase in reported net income.
The amount of any such tax benefit associated with release of our valuation allowance in a particular quarter may be material.
New Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting
Policies
- Impact of recently issued accounting standards
, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and expected impact on our financial position and results of operations.
Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2020 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to Year ended December 31, 2019
See Note 19, Segment Information,
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our change to segment reporting in the second quarter of 2019.
Consolidated net revenues for 2020 were $296,576,000, an increase of $33,599,000, or 12.8%, as compared to $262,977,000 for 2019.
Net revenues, by product line, for the years ended December 31 were as follows (dollars in thousands):
The increase in net revenues was primarily due to an overall 28.6% increase in bookings for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, principally due to an increase of 80.9% in new orders for Advanced Products.
Gross margin for 2020 increased $8,481,000, or 6.9%, to $131,447,000 from $122,966,000 in 2019. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 44.3% in 2020 from 46.8% in 2019. Despite higher net revenues and gross margin dollars for the year ended December 31, 2020, gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an unfavorable change in product mix (i.e., a higher percentage of lower margin products were produced and shipped during the year ended December 31, 2020), a negative influence from production inefficiencies and cost variances associated with initial production volumes of new products, certain supply chain constraints associated with the COVID-19
pandemic, and higher tariff charges.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $63,163,000 for 2020, an increase of $606,000, or 1.0%, as compared to $62,557,000 for 2019. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to 21.3% in 2020 from 23.8% in 2019, primarily due to the increase in net revenues.
The components of the $606,000 increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
(1) Increase primarily attributable to merit-based compensation increases for non-exempt
hourly employees in May 2020, increases in headcount and higher stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options awarded in June 2020.
(2) Increase attributable to net additions of furniture and fixtures and capitalization of building improvements.
(3) Increase primarily attributable to higher use of outside legal services associated with the December 2019 ransomware incident, which carried into the first quarter of 2020, and other corporate legal matters.
(4) Decrease primarily attributable to a decrease in the use of outside service providers at our Andover, MA facility.
(5) Decrease primarily attributed to decreases in sales support expenses, direct mailings, and advertising in trade publications.
(6) Decrease primarily attributable to the decline in net revenues subject to commissions.
(7) Decrease primarily attributable to reduced travel by our sales and marketing personnel, due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic.
Research and development expenses increased $4,328,000, or 9.3%, to $50,916,000 in 2020 from $46,588,000 in 2019. As a percentage of net revenues, research and development expenses decreased to 17.2% in 2020 from 17.7% in 2019, primarily due to the increase in net revenues.
The components of the $4,328,000 increase in research and development expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
(1) Increase primarily attributable to merit-based compensation increases for non-exempt
hourly employees in May 2020, increases in headcount, and higher stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options awarded in June 2020.
(2) Increase primarily attributable to a decrease in the capitalization of costs for certain non-recurring
engineering projects for which the related revenues have been deferred.
(3) Increase primarily attributable to higher spending for new product development of Advanced Products.
(4) Decrease primarily attributable to a decrease in research and development (“R&D”) personnel incurring time on production activities, compared to R&D activities.
The significant changes in the components of “Other income (expense), net” for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in thousands):
Our exposure to market risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to the operations of VJCL, for which the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, and all other subsidiaries in Europe and Asia, for which the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. These other subsidiaries in Europe and Asia experienced more favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in 2020 compared to 2019. Interest income decreased due to a decrease in interest rates.
Income before income taxes was $18,461,000 in 2020, as compared to $14,887,000 in 2019.
The provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31 were as follows (dollars in thousands):
The effective tax rates were lower than the statutory tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 primarily due to the Company’s full valuation allowance position against domestic deferred tax assets. The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included estimated foreign income taxes and estimated state taxes in jurisdictions in which the Company does not have sufficient net operating loss carryforwards.
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding our current assessment of the valuation allowance against all domestic deferred tax assets, and the possible release (i.e., reduction) of the allowance in the future.
We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $17,910,000, or $0.41 per diluted share, as compared to $14,098,000, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At December 31, 2020, we had $161,742,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $50,166,000 of highly liquid short-term investments. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 7.8:1 at December 31, 2020, as compared to 6.0:1 at December 31, 2019. Net working capital increased $127,283,000 to $276,419,000 at December 31, 2020 from $149,136,000 at December 31, 2019.
The primary working capital changes were due to the following (in thousands):
The primary sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 were: (i) approximately $109,681,000 of cash received in the form of net proceeds from the completion of the public offering of our Common Stock in June 2020, (ii) $34,547,000 of cash generated through operating activities, and (iii) $11,585,000 of cash received in connection with the exercise of options to purchase our Common Stock awarded under our stock option plans and the issuance of Common Stock under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The primary uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $50,166,000 for the purchase of short-term investments and $28,653,000 for the purchase of property and equipment.
In November 2000, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30,000,000 of Common Stock (the “November 2000 Plan”). The November 2000 Plan authorizes us to make such repurchases from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing of such repurchases and the number of shares purchased in each transaction are at the discretion of management based on its view of economic and financial market conditions. We did not repurchase shares of Common Stock under the November 2000 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $8,541,000 remaining for share purchases under the November 2000 Plan.
As of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance
sheet arrangements.
The table below summarizes our contractual obligations for operating leases as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1) For further information, refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Leases
, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As of December 31. 2020, we had approximately $13,141,000 of capital expenditure commitments, principally for manufacturing equipment, which we intend to fund with existing cash. In addition to these commitments, as of December 31, 2020 we had approximately $63,800,000, in aggregate, of budgeted capital expenditures associated with the construction of an addition to the Company’s existing manufacturing facility and the purchase and installation of new production equipment, which represent our primary liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We believe cash generated from operations together with our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund planned operational needs, capital equipment purchases, and the construction activities for the foreseeable future.
We do not consider the impact of inflation and changing prices on our business activities or fluctuations in the exchange rates for foreign currency transactions to have been significant during the last three fiscal years.
