Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”. Byline assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.
COVID-19 Response
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused health and economic concerns in the United States and globally. In March 2020 the United States declared a public health and national emergency due to COVID-19, which resulted in mandatory stay-at-home orders in most U.S. states, including Illinois and Wisconsin. The impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continue to have destabilizing and negative effects on global, national, and local economic and business activity. We continue to proactively engage with our customers to assist them through these uncertain times.
We initiated a series of measures to ensure the safety of employees, customers, and communities, to support customer needs, and to limit operational disruptions. We maximized social distancing protocols by augmenting business hours and the locations of employee teams. All of our non-retail employees have the ability to work from home and have done so during this time since mid-March 2020. We have converted 22 branches to drive-thru only locations and have 24 branch locations allowing regular lobby traffic.
CARES Act
In response to this economic disruption, federal and state governments enacted laws intending to stimulate the economy during this time. The CARES Act was signed on March 27, 2020, which, among other things, initiated the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) under the SBA. PPP loans originated before June 5, 2020 have a two-year term and bear an interest rate of 1.0%, however borrowers can request an extension to five-years. PPP loans originated after June 5, 2020 have a five-year term and bear an interest rate of 1.0%. On April 16, 2020, the original $349.0 billion of funding for loans to small businesses under the PPP was depleted, and on April 27, 2020 the Federal government funded an additional $310.0 billion to the PPP. As a preferred SBA lender, we assisted our customers in participating in the initial and second round of funding appropriations approved by Congress for the PPP, which was designed to help small businesses maintain their workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to provide our customers with access to the PPP, and through December 31, 2020, we registered over 3,700 loans totaling $635.4 million. As of December 31, 2020, over $366.9 million of PPP loans were in various stages of the SBA forgiveness process, with over $110.1 million approved for forgiveness by the SBA. The Company received fee income from the Federal government of approximately $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This fee income is deferred over the life of the PPP loan and before costs incurred by the Company, including technology costs for loan application and processing and loan servicing costs. The following table provides the net PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020:
On January 11, 2021 the Company began accepting applications for the new round of PPP funding and on January 29, 2021 the SBA opened its portal for all participating lenders to submit PPP applications. As of March 1, 2021, we had received over 2,300 applications and approved funding of $270.2 million.
COVID-19 Loan and Lease Deferrals
The CARES Act also temporarily eases the guidance applicable to loan modifications and the effect on assessing troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Modifications within the scope of this relief include arrangements that defer or delay payments of principal and/or interest and extend until the earlier of the following: 1) 60 days after the date on which the national emergency related to the COVID-19 outbreak is terminated; or 2) January 1, 2022. At December 31, 2020, we had $100.6 million in active COVID-19 related payment deferrals, or 2.6% of loans and leases, excluding PPP loans. We expect payment deferral requests from borrowers to continue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including our borrowers who have SBA 7(a) loans, and possibly beyond. We have also assisted our customers’ cash flow needs by waiving or refunding certain fees, including early withdrawal fees on time deposits.
In support of our customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and keeping with regulatory guidance, we began offering relief through payment deferrals during the first quarter of 2020. As part of the CARES Act, the SBA is required to pay six months of
principal, interest and any associated fees that borrowers owe for all current 7(a), 504, and Microloans in regular servicing status as well as new 7(a), 504, and Microloans disbursed prior to September 27, 2020. The payments to be made by the SBA are not deferments. These payments will be forgiven, and borrowers will not be expected to make these payments at a later date.
Beginning in the fourth quarter, this payment subsidy expired for some borrowers, and we began offering payment deferrals on SBA 7(a) loans. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 (“CAA”) enacted on December 27, 2020, the SBA will again make payments on covered loans for two months beginning with the first payment due on the loan on or after February 1, 2021. For certain industries and depending on the date of approval and funding, the SBA will make three months of payments. The SBA program is subject to adjustment by the SBA and is based on the availability of funds. The CAA also increased the guaranteed on 7(a) loans from 75% to 90%.
The following table shows active deferrals by category, as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1) Excludes PPP loans
Critical accounting policies and estimates
Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare financial statements and interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes; and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements.
These critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) acquisition-related fair value computations, (ii) the carrying value of loans and leases, (iii) determining the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses, (iv) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, servicing assets and core deposit intangibles, (v) the determination of fair value for financial instruments, including other-than-temporary-impairment losses, (vi) the valuation of real estate held for sale, and (vii) the valuation or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as we remain an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided for under the JOBS Act.
The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require us to make complex and subjective judgments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
Business combinations
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). We recognize the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of the fair value of consideration provided over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Application of the acquisition method requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
In accordance with ASC 805, the acquiring company retains the right to make appropriate adjustments to the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity for information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period ends as of the earlier of (i) one year from the acquisition date or (ii) the date when the acquirer receives the information necessary to complete the business combination accounting.
Carrying value of loans and leases
Our accounting methods for loans and leases differ depending on whether they are new or acquired loans and leases, and for acquired loans, whether the loans were acquired at a discount as a result of credit deterioration since the date of origination.
Originated loans and leases
We account for originated loans and leases and purchased loans and leases not acquired through business combinations as originated loans and leases. The new loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any allowance for loan and lease losses, unamortized deferred fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the new loans using methods which approximate the level yield method. Discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated term of the new loans using methods that approximate the effective yield method. Interest income on new loans is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance outstanding. Additionally, once an acquired non-impaired loan reaches its contractual maturity date, it is re-underwritten, and if renewed, it is classified as an originated loan.
Acquired loans and leases
Acquired loans and leases are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan and lease losses is not recorded at the acquisition date. Acquired loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either acquired impaired or acquired non-impaired. Acquired impaired loans reflect evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required principal and interest will not be collected by us. Subsequent to acquisition, we periodically update for changes in cash flow expectations, which are reflected in interest income over the life of the loan as accretable yield. Any subsequent decreases in expected cash flow attributable to credit deterioration are recognized by recording a provision for loan losses.
For acquired non-impaired loans and leases, the excess or deficit of the loan and lease principal balance over the fair value is recorded as a premium or discount at acquisition and is accreted through interest income over the life of the loan or lease. Subsequent to acquisition, these loans and leases are evaluated for credit deterioration and a provision for loan and lease losses would be recorded when probable loss is incurred. These loans and leases are evaluated for impairment consistent with originated loans and leases.
Provision and allowance for loan and lease losses
The provision for loan and lease losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) at an appropriate level based upon management’s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves.
The ALLL is maintained at a level that management believes is appropriate to provide for known and inherent incurred loan and lease losses as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and we have established methodologies for the determination of its adequacy. The methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are determined on an individual loan basis. We increase our ALLL by charging provisions for probable losses against our income and decrease by charge-offs, net of recoveries.
The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases, changes in economic or other conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods.
The ALLL is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to provide for probable losses based upon an ongoing review of the originated and acquired non-impaired loan and lease portfolios by portfolio category, which include consideration of actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in the size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations which may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, and evaluation of prevailing economic conditions.
For acquired impaired loans, a specific valuation allowance is established when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all of the cash flows expected at acquisition, plus the additional cash flows expected to be collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition.
The originated and non-impaired acquired loans have experienced increasing delinquency and credit loss history that have trended upward, primarily in the U.S. government guaranteed portfolio. The credit quality of loans in these loan portfolios are impacted by delinquency status and debt service coverage generated by the borrowers’ businesses and fluctuations in the value of real estate collateral.
Acquired non-impaired loans and originated loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. All acquired non-impaired loans and originated loans of $100,000 or greater with an internal risk rating of substandard or below, or on nonaccrual, as well as loans classified as TDR, are reviewed individually for impairment on a quarterly basis.
In March of 2020, the CARES Act was enacted by the U.S. government in response to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act provided that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the President of the United States terminates. The CAA further extended the suspension period until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the President of the United States terminates. The Company has modifications under these Acts. The underlying loans and leases are subject to the same underwriting, risk-rating and accrual standards as the rest of the loan portfolio.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically evaluated for impairment under the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”).
Impairment testing is performed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach at the reporting unit level. Our goodwill is allocated to Byline Bank, which is our only applicable reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. We have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we perform a goodwill impairment evaluation on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists.
Servicing assets. Servicing assets are recognized separately when they are acquired through sales of loans or when the rights to service loans are purchased. When loans are sold with servicing rights retained, servicing assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (“ASC 860”). Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in the prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. See Note 7 and Note 17 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information.
Core deposit intangible assets. Other intangible assets primarily consist of core deposit intangible assets. In valuing core deposit intangibles, we consider variables such as deposit servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the core deposit intangibles is determined to be less than its carrying value, we would then measure the amount of impairment based on an estimate of the fair value at that time. We also evaluate whether the events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Core deposit intangibles are currently amortized over an approximate ten-year period.
Customer relationship intangible. Other intangible assets also include our customer relationship intangible asset. In valuing our customer relationship intangibles, we consider variables such as assets under management, attrition rates, and fee structure. Customer relationship intangibles are currently amortized over a 12-year period.
Fair value of financial instruments
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.
See Note 17 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a complete discussion of our use of fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their related measurement practices.
Valuation of real estate held for sale
Other real estate owned (OREO). OREO includes real estate assets that have been acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or repossession and are to be sold. OREO assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the
collateral of the loan, on the date of foreclosure or repossession, establishing a new cost basis. Adjustments that reduce loan balances to fair value at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized as charge-offs in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Positive adjustments, if any, at the time of foreclosure or repossession are recognized as a reduction in non-interest expense. After foreclosure or repossession, management periodically obtains new valuations and real estate or other assets may be adjusted to a lower carrying amount, determined by the fair value of the asset, less estimated costs to sell. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded as a decrease in the asset and charged against other real estate owned valuation adjustments, included within non-interest expense. Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, are included in non-interest expense, and gains and losses on their disposition are included in non-interest expense. Gains on internally financed other real estate owned sales are accounted for in accordance with the methods stated in ASC Topic 360-20, Real Estate Sales (“ASC 360-20”). Any losses on the sales of other real estate owned properties are recognized immediately.
Assets held for sale. Assets held for sale consist of former branch locations and real estate purchased for expansion. Assets are considered held for sale when management has approved a plan to sell the assets following a branch closure or other events. The properties are being actively marketed and transferred to assets held for sale based at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Adjustments to reduce the asset balances to fair value are recorded at the time of transfer and are recognized through a charge against income. An assessment of the recoverability of other long-lived assets associated with all branches is periodically performed, resulting in impairment losses that are reflected in other non-interest expense.
Income taxes
We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and available tax planning opportunities. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss carryforwards. We review our deferred tax positions quarterly for changes which may impact realizability. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. We use short and long-range business forecasts to provide additional information for its evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as components of non-interest expense.
A deferred tax valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. See Note 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information on income taxes.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the effective dates of adoption and anticipated effects on our results of operations and finance as condition, see Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business
As a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our consolidated financial statements as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the final condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region. Comparison of our financial performance against other financial institutions is impacted by the accounting for acquired non-impaired and acquired impaired loans.
These factors and metrics described in this annual report on Form 10-K may not provide an appropriate basis to compare our results or financial condition to the results or financial condition of other financial services companies, given our limited operating history and strategic acquisitions since our recapitalization.
Results of Operations
Overview
Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans and lease receivables, including accretion income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from fees and service charges on deposits, loan servicing revenue, wealth management and trust income, ATM and interchange fees, and net gains on sales of investment securities and loans. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for loan and lease losses, provision for income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other miscellaneous operating costs.
We reported consolidated net income of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income of $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $19.5 million. The decrease in net income was attributable to a $1.3 million decrease in net interest income and a $35.2 million increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, offset by $6.5 million increase in non-interest income, a $6.1 million decrease in provision for income taxes, and a $4.4 million decrease in non-interest expense. The decrease in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of lower yields on earning assets. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was mainly driven by increases in the general reserves driven by loan and lease originations and increases in qualitative factors caused by the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by gains on the sales of securities. The decrease in provision for income taxes was mostly driven by a decrease in net income before provision for income taxes during the period. The decrease in non-interest expense was mainly due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of an increase in deferred costs for the origination of PPP loans.
We reported consolidated net income of $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $15.8 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a $37.7 million increase in net interest income and a $5.0 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, a $18.9 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $1.9 million increase in provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of our recent acquisitions, organic loan and lease growth, and security purchases, offset by increases in the costs of interest-bearing deposits and increases in average FHLB advances during the current period. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by a decreased downward loan servicing asset revaluation, security sales during the period, an increase in the fair value of equity securities, net, and the acquisitions. The increase in provision for income taxes was mostly driven by an increase in net income before provision for income taxes during the period. The increase in non-interest expense was mainly due to additional costs associated with the acquisitions, primarily salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a decrease in data processing of $4.5 million resulting from the core system conversion charges incurred in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses was mainly driven by increases in the general reserves driven by loan and lease originations.
Dividends declared and paid on preferred shares were $783,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Dividends declared on common shares were $4.6 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dividends paid for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5.7 million. There were no dividends paid on common shares during the year ended December 31, 2019.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, net income available to common stockholders was $36.7 million, or $0.96 per basic and diluted common share, $56.2 million, or $1.51 per basic and $1.48 per diluted common share, and $40.4 million, or $1.21 per basic and $1.18 per diluted common share, respectively.
Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 produced an annual return on average assets of 0.61%, 1.08% and 0.97%, and a return on average stockholders’ equity of 4.78%, 8.05% and 7.34%, respectively.
Net interest income
Net interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings. We generate interest income from interest and dividends on interest-earning assets, which include loans, leases and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which include interest-bearing deposits, subordinated notes, junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources.
We also recognize income from the accretable discounts associated with the purchase of interest-earning assets. Because of our recapitalization and acquisitions, we derive a portion of our interest income from the accretable discounts on acquired loans. The accretion is generally recognized over the life of the loan and is impacted by changes in expected cash flows on the loan. This
accretion will continue to have an impact on our net interest income as long as loans acquired with a discount at acquisition represent a meaningful portion of our interest-earning assets. As of December 31, 2020, acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Accounting for Purchased Loans with Deteriorated Credit Quality, represented 4.7% of our total loan portfolio, compared to 6.8 % at December 31, 2019 and 8.0% at December 31, 2018.
Changes in the market interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of the discounts on our acquired loans, which will also affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.
The following tables present, for the periods indicated, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Loan and lease balances are net of deferred origination fees and costs and initial direct costs. Non-accrual loans and leases are included in total loan and lease balances.
(2)
Interest income and rates include the effects of a tax equivalent adjustment to adjust tax-exempt investment income on tax-exempt investment securities to a fully taxable basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21%.
(3)
Represents the average rate earned on interest-earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
(4)
Represents net interest income divided by total average interest-earning assets.
(5)
Average balances are average daily balances.
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following tables set forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis. The tables below are a summary of the increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average balances (volume) and changes in average interest rates (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Includes loans and leases on non-accrual status.
(2)
Interest income and rates include the effects of a tax equivalent adjustment to adjust tax-exempt investment income on tax-exempt investment securities to a fully taxable basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21%.
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $215.0 million, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 0.6% compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in interest income of $25.6 million was principally a result of decreased average yields on loans and leases. The average balance of interest-earning assets was $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $821.5 million, or 17.0%, compared to 2019, primarily due to the origination of PPP loans and purchase of taxable securities. Interest expense decreased by $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, mostly due to declining rates on time deposits. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased $288.5 million, or 10.4%.
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $216.3 million, an increase of $37.7 million, or 21.1% compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in interest income of $57.9 million was principally a result of an increase in loans as a result of the acquisitions, organic loan and lease growth, and an increase in the securities portfolio. The average balance of interest-earning assets was $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $952.1 million, or 24.5%, compared to 2018. Interest expense increased by $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, mostly due to deposits assumed as a result of the acquisitions, increased FHLB advances to fund organic growth, and increased interest cost of interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances resulting from higher market interest rates. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased $571.5 million, or 25.9%.
Interest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.6 million compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 37.5%. This decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in average rates paid on FHLB advances.
Interest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $12.2 million compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.2 million, or 35.3%. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in outstanding FHLB advances in the year ended December 31, 2019, which was a result of growth in the loan and lease portfolio.
The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.80%, a decrease of 67 basis points compared to 4.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased 124 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 82 basis points, for a decrease in the interest rate spread of 42 basis points. The primary driver of the decrease was a decrease in average loan and lease yields resulting from decreased market interest rates, lower-yielding PPP loan balances, and decreased loan accretion.
The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 4.47%, a decrease of 13 basis points compared to 4.60% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 14 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 40 basis points, for a decrease in the interest rate spread of 26 basis points. The main driver of the decrease was increased average interest-bearing deposit costs resulting from increased market interest rates and increased costs on FHLB advances, partially offset by increased securities yields. Projected accretion income as of December 31, 2020 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
Provision for loan and lease losses
The provision for loan and lease losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan and lease losses that, in management’s evaluation, is appropriate to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior charge-offs.
Provisions for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $55.9 million compared to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $35.2 million, or 170.2%. The increase reflects the growth in our loan portfolio, specifically the migration of the acquired portfolio into the originated portfolio, and increases to our general reserves to address the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ALLL as a percentage of loans and leases increased from 0.84% at December 31, 2019 to 1.53% at December 31, 2020.
Provisions for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $20.7 million compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million, or 10.2%. The increase reflects the growth in our loan portfolio, particularly the unguaranteed portion of U.S. government guaranteed loans, the migration of the acquired portfolio into the originated portfolio, and increases to our general reserves. The ALLL as a percentage of loans and leases increased from 0.72% at December 31, 2018 to 0.84% at December 31, 2019.
Non-interest income
Non-interest income was $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.5 million or 11.7%. The increase in non-interest income was mostly due to an increase in net gains on sale of securities.
Non-interest income was $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.0 million or 12.0%. The increase in non-interest income was mostly due to a decreased downward loan servicing asset revaluation adjustment due to changes in fair value of the servicing asset, security sales during the
period, an increase in the fair value of equity securities, net, and wealth management and trust income as a result of the full year impact of the First Evanston acquisition.
The following table presents the major components of our non-interest income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
Loan servicing revenue was $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $624,000, or 5.8%. Loan servicing revenue was $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $423,000 or 4.1%. The increases in both years were primarily driven by an increase in total loans serviced due to additional U.S. government guaranteed loans sold with retained servicing rights. At December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the outstanding balances of U.S. government guaranteed loans serviced, were $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively.
Loan servicing asset revaluation represents net changes in the fair value of our servicing assets. Loan servicing asset revaluation had a downward adjustment of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a downward adjustment of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 25.4%. The decrease was a result of secondary market volatility caused by the economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan servicing asset revaluation had a downward adjustment of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.6 million or 28.4%. The variances are primarily driven by the change in fair value of the servicing asset as a result of changes to valuation assumptions, including prepayment speeds, discount rates, and expected average loan life on U.S. government guaranteed loans based on the current interest rate environment.
ATM and interchange fees were $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $380,000 or 10.0%. The increase was primarily driven by higher interchange volume and rates. ATM and interchange fees were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $528,000 or 12.2%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower interchange income, decreased transactional account volume, and a credit card agreement signing bonus in the prior period.
Gains on sales of securities were $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $4.2 million or 360.6%. Gains on sales of securities were $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $987,000 or 601.8%. The variances were due to sales volume. We sold $209.0 million, $92.1 million, and $5.1 million of securities during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Change in fair value of equity securities, net, was $729,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $687,000 or 48.5%. Changes in fair value of equity securities are recorded through net income rather than other comprehensive income due to the adoption of accounting guidance as of January 1, 2019. The amount recorded during the periods are a result of the increase or decrease in the fair value of these securities.
Net gains on sales of loans were $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5, or 4.7%. The increase in net gains on sales was primarily driven by higher premiums for government guaranteed loans. Net gains on sales of loans were $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $294,000 or 0.9%. The increase in net gains on sales was primarily driven by increased government guaranteed loan sales volume and partially offset by decreased average premiums. We sold
$369.0 million, $336.2 million and $320.5 million of U.S. government guaranteed loans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Wealth management and trust income represents fees charged to customers for investment, trust, or wealth management services and are primarily determined by total assets under management. Wealth management and trust income was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $102,000 or 4.0%. Wealth management and trust income was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.0 million or 66.9%. We did not offer these services prior to the First Evanston acquisition during the second quarter of 2018. Assets under management were $569.4 million, $568.5 million and $571.5 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Other non-interest income was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.2 million or 28.7%. Customer derivative products fee income was $414,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $893,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $479,000. Other non-interest income was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.3 million. Customer derivative products fee income was $893,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $772,000.
Non-interest expense
We reported non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $169.4 million compared to $173.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.4 million or 2.5%. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits due to increased deferred costs for the origination of PPP loans, as well as decreases in loan and lease related expenses, legal, audit and other professional fees, data processing and advertising and promotions due to general economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increases to other non-interest expense due to expenses associated with our strategic branch consolidation efforts and impairment charges on assets held for sale.
Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $173.8 million compared to $153.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $19.9 million or 12.9%. The increase primarily due to the additional expenses as a result of our acquisition related activity, including salaries and employee benefits, system conversion expenses, other intangible asset amortization expense, and the core system conversion completed in the first and third quarters of 2019.
The following table presents the major components of our non-interest expense for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
Salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $89.8 million compared to $95.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $5.6 million or 5.8%, primarily due to the deferral of costs related to PPP loan originations and lower staffing levels. Our staffing decreased from 1,001 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2019 to 918 as of December 31, 2020.
Salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $95.3 million compared to $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $14.9 million or 18.6%, primarily due to increased staffing as a result of our acquisitions. Our staffing increased from 943 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2018 to 1,001 as of December 31, 2019.
Occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $19.4 million compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2.7 million or 16.4%. The increase was primarily a result of increased real estate taxes, investment in technology and equipment, and expenses related to branch consolidations. Occupancy expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $16.7 million compared to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 839,000 or 5.3%. The increase was primarily a result of branch additions from acquisitions.
Equipment expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.6 million compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $452,000 or 14.6%. Equipment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.1 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $684,000 or 28.3%. The increase in each year was primarily a result of increased investment in equipment and technology assets.
Loan and lease related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $6.0 million compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.1 million or 25.7%. The decrease was primarily driven by higher loan expense reimbursements from borrowers. Loan and lease related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $8.0 million compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million or 31.2%. The increase was primarily driven by additional loans and leases from organic growth and increased collection expense.
Legal, audit and other professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $8.1 million compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.3 million or 28.9%. The decrease reflects merger related expenses incurred during 2019. Legal, audit and other professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $11.5 million compared to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $80,000 or 0.7%.
Data processing expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.9 million compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.8 million or 20.6%. The decrease is reflective of core system conversion expenses incurred during 2019 related to the Oak Park River Forest acquisition. Data processing expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $13.7 million compared to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.5 million or 24.7%. The decrease was primarily due to contract termination expenses during the second quarter of 2018 related to our core system conversion, which was completed during the first quarter of 2019.
Net loss recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses were $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase in expense of $1.2 million, or 173.6%. This variance was primarily attributed to impairments of other real estate owned assets. Net loss recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses were $665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $235,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $430,000 or 183.0%. This variance was primarily attributed to decreased gains on sales of other real estate owned assets.
Regulatory assessments for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.2 million compared to $697,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5 million, or 218.6%. The increase was primarily driven by an increased FDIC insurance assessment as a result of credits received during 2019. Regulatory assessments for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $697,000 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 60.0%. The decrease was primarily driven by an FDIC credit and improved financial ratios.
Other intangible assets amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.6 million, compared to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $113,000, or 1.5%. Other intangible assets amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.7 million compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.1 million, or 37.5%. The increase was attributed to additional core deposit intangible asset amortization and customer relationship intangible asset amortization as a result of the acquisitions.
Advertising and promotions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.3 million compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.1 million or 62.1%, primarily due to an decrease in advertising campaigns and sponsorships. Advertising and promotions for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.4 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.7 million, or 97.1%, primarily due to an increase in advertising attributable to deposit campaigns and an increase in sponsorships.
Telecommunications expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.7 million compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $235,000 or 12.0%. The decrease was primarily a result of our cost savings initiatives. Telecommunications expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.0 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $253,000 or 14.8%. The increase was primarily a result of our larger branch network and integration expenses partially offset by cost savings initiatives
Other non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.0 million compared to $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.9 million, or 53.6%. The increase was primarily a result of disposal losses and asset impairments taken as part of our strategic branch consolidation efforts. Other non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $11.0 million compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.5 million, or 29.7%.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our efficiency ratio was 58.40%, 61.10%, and 65.00%, respectively. The improvements in our efficiency ratio were primarily attributable to increased non-interest income due to increase revenue related to loan servicing, increased net gains on sales of securities and sales of loans, and decreased non-interest expense primarily driven by decreased salary and employee benefit expenses. These improvements were offset by decreases in net interest income due to decreased loan and lease interest income. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 56.68%, 58.54%, and 59.51%, respectively. Please refer to the “GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included in item 6 of this report, for more information on how our adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in 2020 income tax expense was primarily due to decreased income before provision for income taxes during the period. Income tax expense was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in 2019 income tax expense was primarily due to increased income before provision for income taxes during the period.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss (“NOL”) carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company has evaluated the impact of the CARES Act and determined that none of the changes would result in a material income tax benefit to the Company.
Our effective tax rate was 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, 26.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect our effective tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 25% to 27%.
Financial Condition
Balance sheet analysis
Our total assets increased by $868.8 million, or 15.7%, to $6.4 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $5.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets includes an increase of $554.9 million, or 14.7%, in loans and leases from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2019 to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2020. Our originated loan and lease portfolio increased by $832.8 million and our acquired loan and lease portfolio decreased by $277.9 million. The increase in our originated portfolio was mostly attributed to organic loan and lease growth, primarily PPP loans, and renewals of acquired non-impaired loans that are now reflected in originated loans. The decrease in our acquired portfolio was due to renewals reflected in originated loans, payoffs and pay downs during the period.
Total liabilities increased by $813.5 million, or 17.0%, to $5.6 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase is a result of an increase in total deposits of $604.5 million, or 14.6%, primarily attributed growth in non-interest bearing deposits and money market demand deposits and issuance of subordinated debentures during the year.
Investment portfolio
Our investment securities portfolio consists of securities classified as equity and other securities, at fair value, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity. There were no securities classified as trading in our investment portfolio as of or for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. All available-for sale securities are carried at fair value and may be used for liquidity purposes should management consider it to be in our best interest. Securities available-for-sale consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agencies securities.
Securities available-for-sale increased $260.9 million, or 22.0%, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributed to purchases of mortgage-backed securities.
Our held-to-maturity securities portfolio consists of municipal securities. We carry these securities at amortized cost. Securities held-to-maturity were $4.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The fair value of our equity and other securities portfolio was $8.8 million at December 31, 2020, and $8.0 million at December 31, 2019.
We had no securities that were classified as having other-than-temporary-impairment (“OTTI”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following tables summarize the fair value of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolio as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):
Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At December 31, 2020, we evaluated the securities which had an unrealized loss for OTTI and determined all declines in value to be temporary. There were 37 investment securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2020. We anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.
The following tables (dollars in thousands) set forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our debt securities as of the dates presented. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

As of December 31, 2020, investment securities indexed to LIBOR were $44.3 million.
Total non-taxable securities classified as obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions were $77.4 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.1 million from December 31, 2019.
There were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, with total outstanding balances greater than 10% of our stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Restricted stock
As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, Byline Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. No market exists for this stock, and it has no quoted market value. The stock is redeemable at par by the FHLB and is, therefore, carried at cost. In addition, Byline Bank owns stock of Bankers’ Bank, which is redeemable at par and carried at cost. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held $10.5 million and $22.1 million, respectively, in FHLB and Bankers’ Bank stock. We evaluate impairment of our investment in FHLB and Bankers’ Bank based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. We did not identify any indicators of impairment of FHLB and Bankers’ Bank stock as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Loan and lease portfolio
Lending-related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is the main driver of the results of our operations. Total loans and leases at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, an increase of $554.9 million or 14.7%. The growth in the originated loan and lease portfolio was primarily driven by increases in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial loans and leases, and PPP loans. Acquired impaired loans and acquired non-impaired loans and leases were $672.1 million at December 31, 2020 a decrease of $227.9 million or 29.3%, compared to $950.0 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in the acquired loan and lease portfolio was driven by renewals that are reflected within originated loans, payoffs, and maturities during the period.
We strive to maintain a relatively diversified loan portfolio to help reduce the risk inherent in concentration in certain types of collateral. The Company’s exposure to certain industries as of December 31, 2020 represents the following percentages of the portfolio: 27.1% real estate, 13.9% manufacturing, 6.9% consumer, 6.6% retail trade, 5.7% wholesale trade, 5.4% accommodation and food services, and all other industries represent less than 5% of the portfolio or 34.4% of the total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, the loan portfolio included $418.7 million of unguaranteed SBA 7(a) and USDA loans with exposure to the following top three industries: 16.7% accommodation and food services, 15.1% retail trade and 12.6% manufacturing. The following table shows our allocation of originated, acquired impaired and acquired non-impaired loans and leases as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):
Loans collateralized by real estate comprised 51.4% and 59.8% of the loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Commercial real estate loans comprised the largest portion of the real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and totaled $1.4 billion, or 63.9%, of real estate loans and 32.8% of the total loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, commercial real estate loans totaled $1.3 billion and comprised 56.3% of real estate loans and 33.7% of the total loan and lease portfolio. Acquired impaired commercial real estate loans decreased from $135.9 million as of December 31, 2019 to $108.5 million as of December 31, 2020, or 20.2%. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, commercial real estate loans, including both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied, as a percentage of total capital were 282.5% and 308.2%, respectively. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans were $533.9 million and $459.9 million, or 79.0% and 76.3% of total capital, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Residential real estate loans totaled $572.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $711.8 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $139.6 million or 19.6%. The residential real estate loan portfolio comprised 25.7% and 31.4% of real estate loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 13.3% and 18.8% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Acquired impaired residential real estate loans decreased from $100.2 million as of December 31, 2019 to $78.8 million as of December 31, 2020, or 21.3%.
Construction, land development and other land loans totaled $230.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $278.7 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $47.9 million or 17.2%. The construction, land development and other land loan portfolio comprised 10.4% and 12.3% of real estate loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 5.3% and 7.3% of the total loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Commercial and industrial loans totaled $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $37.3 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to organic growth. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio comprised 31.5% and 35.2% of the total loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Lease financing receivables comprised 5.2% and 4.8% of the loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total lease financing receivables were $227.1 million and $180.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $46.6 million, or 25.8%,primarily due to higher origination levels.
Loan and lease portfolio maturities and interest rate sensitivity
The following table shows our loan and lease portfolio by scheduled maturity at December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
As of December 31, 2020, 52.7% of the loan and lease portfolio bears interest at fixed rates and 47.3% at floating rates. In addition, $907.0 million, or 20.9%, of the loan and lease portfolio had interest rate floors of which $788.6 million were at the interest rate floor as of December 31, 2020. The expected life of our loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Because a portion of the portfolio is accounted for under ASC 310-30, the carrying value is significantly affected by estimates and it is impracticable to allocate scheduled payments for those loans based on those estimates. Consequently, the tables presented include information limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.1 billion in loans indexed to LIBOR.
Allowance for loan and lease losses
The ALLL is determined by us on a quarterly basis, although we are engaged in monitoring the appropriate level of the allowance on a more frequent basis. The ALLL reflects management’s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios. The computation includes elements of judgment and high levels of subjectivity.
Factors considered by us include, but are not limited to, actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, and evaluation of the prevailing economic conditions. Changes in conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods.
We assess the ALLL based on three categories: (i) originated loans and leases, (ii) acquired non-impaired loans and leases, and (iii) acquired impaired loans with further credit deterioration after the acquisitions or our recapitalization.
Total ALLL was $66.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $31.9 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $34.4 million, or 107.7%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in specific impairments in the unguaranteed portion of the U.S. government guaranteed portfolio and an increase in the general reserve driven by impact of the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Total ALLL to total loans and leases held for investment, net before ALLL was 1.53% and 0.84% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $31.7 million of the ALLL was allocated to unguaranteed loans.
The following table presents an analysis of the allowance of the loan and lease losses for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
Non-performing assets
Non-performing loans and leases include loans and leases 90 days past due and still accruing and loans and leases accounted for on a non-accrual basis. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and leases plus other real estate owned. Non-accrual loans and leases as December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $41.1 million and $36.3 million, respectively. Non-performing assets consisted of $3.6 million and $4.2 million of U.S. government guaranteed balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Total OREO decreased from $9.9 million as of December 31, 2019 to $6.3 million at December 31, 2020. The $3.5 million decrease in OREO resulted primarily from sales and valuation adjustments.
The following table sets forth the amounts of non-performing loans and leases, non-performing assets, and OREO at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Includes $5.6 million and $8.8 million of non-accrual restructured loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(2)
For the year ended December 31, 2020, $2.6 million in interest income would have been recorded had non-accrual loans been current.
(3)
For the year ended December 31, 2020, $452,000 in interest income would have been recorded had troubled debt restructurings included within non-accrual loans been current.
Acquired impaired loans (accounted for under ASC 310-30) that are delinquent and/or on non-accrual status continue to accrue income provided the respective pool in which those assets reside maintains a discount and recognizes accretion income. The aforementioned loans are characterized as performing loans based on contractual delinquency. If the pool no longer has a discount and accretion income can no longer be recognized, any loan within that pool on non-accrual status will be classified as non-accrual for presentation purposes.
Total non-accrual loans increased by $4.8 million between December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to additional non-accrual loans for commercial real estate.
Total accruing loans past due decreased from $40.2 million at December 31, 2019 to $14.6 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $25.6 million, or 64.0%, and can be attributed to decreases in commercial real estate and construction, land development, and other land loans. See Note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information.
Deposits
We gather deposits primarily through each of our 45 branch locations in the Chicago metropolitan area and one branch in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Through our branch network, online, mobile and other banking channels, we offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposit accounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Small businesses are a significant source of low cost deposits as they value convenience, flexibility and access to local decision makers that are responsive to their needs.
Total deposits at December 31, 2020 were $4.8 billion, representing an increase of $604.5 million, or 14.6%, compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Non-interest-bearing deposits were $1.8 billion, or 37.1% of total deposits, at December 31, 2020, an increase of $483.0 million, or 37.7%, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019, or 31.8% of total deposits. The increase in total deposits is primarily due to government stimulus programs. Core deposits were 89.9% and 83.1% of total deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following tables show the average balance amounts and the average contractual rates paid on our deposits for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
Our average cost of deposits was 35 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 91 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributed to lower rates on interest-bearing deposits as a result of the interest rate environment and an improved deposit mix. We had $35.0 million and $41.0 million of brokered time deposits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table shows time deposits and other time deposits of $100,000 or more by time remaining until maturity (dollars in thousands):
Borrowed funds
On June 26, 2020, the Company issued $50.0 million in 6.00% fixed-to-floating subordinated notes that mature on July 1, 2030. On August 3, 2020, the Company issued an additional $25.0 million. The subordinated notes bear a fixed interest rate of 6.00% until July 1, 2025 and a floating interest rate equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 588 basis points thereafter until maturity (or earlier redemption). The Company may, at its option, redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on a semi-annual basis beginning on July 1, 2025, subject to obtaining the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to the extent such approval is then required. The subordinated notes are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The transaction resulted in debt issuance costs of approximately $1.7 million that will be amortized over 10 years.
In addition to deposits, we also utilize FHLB advances as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. The Bank’s advances from the FHLB are collateralized by residential and multi-family real estate loans and securities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, subject to the availability of collateral. At December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding FHLB advances of $234.0 million with maturities through May 2021.
On April 21, 2020, the Bank entered into a Letter Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago that allows the Bank to access the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (the “PPPLF”). Under the terms of the PPPLF, the Bank pledges loans originated under the PPP to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as collateral for available advances under the PPPLF. Advances under the PPPLF are an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of PPP loans pledged by Byline Bank, carry an interest rate of 35 basis points and mature on the maturity date of the PPP loans pledged as collateral for the advance. As of December 31, 2020, the PPPLF had $371.9 million with an interest rate of 0.35% with various maturity dates in April 2022 and May 2022.
The Company has the capacity to borrow funds from the discount window of the Federal Reserve System. The Company utilized the discount window to lower its cost of funds during 2020. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Federal Reserve Bank discount window line as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company pledges loans as collateral for any borrowings under the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our short-term borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
(1)
We amended the credit agreement, which extended the maturity date to October, 2021. The amended revolving line of credit bears interest at either the LIBOR Rate plus 195 basis points or the Prime Rate minus 75 basis points, based on our election, which is required to be communicate to the lender at least three business days prior to the commencement of an interest period. If we fail to provide timely notification, the interest rate will be Prime Rate minus 75 basis points.
Customer repurchase agreements (sweeps)
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent a demand deposit product offered to customers that sweep balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit into overnight repurchase agreements. We pledge securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by $7.6 million from $49.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $42.0 at December 31, 2020.
Liquidity
We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposits as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without undue loss, the amount of
cash and liquid securities we hold and the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the re-pricing characteristics of our liabilities, the ability to securitize and sell certain pools of assets and other factors.
Our liquidity needs are primarily met by cash and investment securities positions, growth in deposits, cash flow from amortizing loan portfolios, and borrowings from the FHLB and PPPLF. For additional information regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows, see “Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows” in our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
As of December 31, 2020, Byline Bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $2.0 billion and $874.7 million from the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”). As of December 31, 2020, Byline Bank had open advances of $234.0 million and open letters of credit of $21.3 million, leaving us with available aggregate borrowing capacity of $751.9 million. In addition, Byline Bank had an uncommitted federal funds line available of $115.0 million and $874.7 million available under the Federal Reserve Bank discount window line at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2019, Byline Bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $1.9 billion and $547.8 million from the FRB. As of December 31, 2019, Byline Bank had open advances of $490.0 million and open letters of credit of $20.8 million, leaving us with available aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion. In addition, Byline Bank had an uncommitted federal funds line available of $115.0 million and $547.8 million available under the Federal Reserve Bank discount window line at December 31, 2019.
On October 13, 2016, the Company entered into a $30.0 million revolving credit agreement with a correspondent bank. Through subsequent amendments, the revolving credit agreement was reduced to $15.0 million and the maturity was extended to October 8, 2021. The amended revolving line of credit bears interest at either the LIBOR plus 195 basis points or the Prime Rate minus 75 basis points, based on the Company’s election, which is required to be communicated at least three business days prior to the commencement of an interest period. If the Company fails to provide timely notification, the interest rate will be Prime Rate minus 75 basis points. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no balance was outstanding on the line of credit.
There are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of Byline Bank to pay dividends to the Company. See Note 20 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations.
We expect that our cash and liquidity resources will be generated by the operations of Byline Bank, which we expect to be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Capital resources
Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $805.5 million compared to $750.1 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $55.3 million, or 7.4%. The increase was primarily driven by net income generated during the year and increases in accumulated other comprehensive income reflecting the unrealized gains in our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
The Company and Byline Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements.
Under applicable bank regulatory capital requirements, each of the Company and Byline Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Byline Bank must also meet certain specific capital guidelines under the prompt corrective action framework. The capital amounts and classification are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Byline Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, (referred to as the “leverage ratio”), as defined under these capital requirements. For further information, see Item 1. “Business-Supervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements” and “Business-Supervision and Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action Framework.”
As of December 31, 2020, Byline Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements and was considered “well-capitalized.” There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2020 that management believes have changed Byline Bank’s classifications.
The regulatory capital ratios for the Company and Byline Bank to meet the minimum capital adequacy standards and for Byline Bank to be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework and the Company’s and Byline Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios are set forth in the following tables as of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
The Company and Byline Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The conservation buffers for the Company and Byline Bank exceed the minimum capital requirement at 7.36% and 6.16% as of December 31, 2020.
Provisions of state and federal banking regulations may limit, by statute, the amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company by Byline Bank without prior approval of Byline Bank’s regulatory agencies. The Company is economically dependent on the cash dividends received from Byline Bank. These dividends represent the Company’s primary cash flow from operating activities used to service its obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company received $7.5 million and $13.5 million, respectively, in cash dividends from Byline Bank in order to pay the required interest on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures in connection with its trust preferred securities interest, interest on its outstanding subordinated notes, dividends on the Series B preferred stock outstanding, and to fund other Company-related activities.
On December 10, 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The shares may, at the discretion of management, be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases as market conditions warrant or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and share price of shares purchased under the repurchase program will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The shares authorized to be repurchased represent approximately 3.2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock at December 31, 2020. The new program will be effective January 1, 2021 and be in effect until December 31, 2022. Under the stock repurchase program that terminated on December 31, 2020, the Company purchased 118,486 shares of the 1,250,000 total shares authorized for repurchase under that program. See Part II Item 5. Of this report for more information.
Contractual obligations
The following table presents our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020. Further information regarding the details of each obligation is included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. See specific note references in the table below (dollars in thousands):
Off-balance sheet items and other financing arrangements
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by Byline Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral is primarily obtained in the form of commercial and residential real estate (including income producing commercial properties).
Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Byline Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 90 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 1.25 to 18.50% and maturities up to 2050. Variable rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from1.25% to 8.25% and maturities up to 2048.
Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same
credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for funded instruments. We do not anticipate any material losses as a result of the commitments and standby letters of credit.
We enter into interest rate swaps that are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate borrowings. We also enter into interest rate derivatives with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers’ risk management strategies and concurrently entered into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty.
We recognize derivative financial instruments at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. We record derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition within other assets and other liabilities, respectively. See Note 21 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. Because the derivative assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these assets and liabilities are listed in the table below (dollars in thousands):
