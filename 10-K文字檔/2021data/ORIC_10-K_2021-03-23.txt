Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled “Selected Financial Data” and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section titled “Risk factors” included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
ORIC Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patients’ lives by Overcoming Resistance In Cancer.
Our fully integrated discovery and development team is advancing a diverse pipeline of innovative therapies designed to counter resistance mechanisms in cancer by leveraging our expertise within three specific areas: hormone-dependent cancers, precision oncology and key tumor dependencies. Our lead product candidate, ORIC-101, builds upon a legacy of successful drug development by our founders in the field of nuclear hormone receptors and their efforts to elucidate the cause of resistance to the groundbreaking prostate cancer therapies that they had developed. ORIC-101 is a potent and selective small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which has been linked to resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapeutics across a variety of solid tumors. In 2019, we initiated two separate Phase 1b trials of ORIC-101 in combination with (1) Xtandi (enzalutamide) in metastatic prostate cancer and (2) Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) in advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In December 2020, we selected the recommend Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the first half of 2021. In January 2021, we selected the RP2D and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the second half of 2021. Our other product candidates include (1) ORIC-533, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73, a key node in the adenosine pathway believed to play a central role in resistance to chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-based treatment regimens, (2) ORIC-944, an allosteric inhibitor of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) via the embryonic ectoderm development (EED) subunit, for which we licensed development and commercialization rights from Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (Mirati) in August 2020 (Mirati License Agreement) and (3) ORIC-114, a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor designed to selectively target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) with high potency towards exon 20 insertion mutations, for which we licensed development and commercialization rights from Voronoi, Inc. (Voronoi) in October 2020 (Voronoi License Agreement). We expect to file an investigational new drug application (IND) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ORIC-533 in the first half of 2021, an IND for ORIC-944 in the second half of 2021 and a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) for ORIC-114 in the second half of 2021. Beyond these product candidates, we are developing multiple precision medicines targeting other hallmark cancer resistance mechanisms.
Since our inception in 2014, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, including with respect to our GR antagonist and CD73 inhibitor programs and other preclinical programs, in-licensing of external programs, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
We have incurred significant losses since the commencement of our operations. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $73.7 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $166.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Our losses and accumulated deficit have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities including in-licensing and to a lesser extent from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase significantly as we continue our development of ORIC-101, ORIC-533, ORIC-944, ORIC-114 and any future product candidates from discovery through preclinical development and into clinical trials as we seek regulatory approval for these product candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of and expenditures on our planned research and development activities.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, outbreak a global pandemic. To limit the spread of COVID-19, governments have taken various actions including the issuance of stay-at-home orders and physical distancing guidelines. Accordingly, businesses have adjusted, reduced or suspended operating activities. Beginning the week of March 16, 2020, the majority of our workforce began working from home. Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of the stay-at-home orders and work-from-home policies, have impacted productivity, have resulted in increased operational expenses, certain adjustments to the operations of our clinical trials, the suspension of enrollment of new patients at certain of our clinical trial sites, and delays in certain supply chain activities and collecting and analyzing data from patients in our clinical trials, and may further disrupt our business and delay our development programs and regulatory timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct business in the ordinary course. As a result, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses may vary significantly if there is an increased impact from COVID-19 on the costs and timing associated with the conduct of our clinical trials and other related business activities.
On April 28, 2020, we completed our IPO of our common stock. In connection with our IPO, we issued and sold 8,625,000 shares of our common stock, including 1,125,000 shares associated with the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $16.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $138.0 million. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $12.8 million, the net proceeds we received from our IPO were approximately $125.2 million.
On November 17, 2020, we completed a public offering of our common stock. In connection with this offering, we issued and sold 5,796,000 shares of our common stock, including 756,000 associated with the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $23.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $133.3 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $8.5 million, the net proceeds we received from the transaction were approximately $124.8 million.
In the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into license agreements with Mirati and Voronoi, respectively. As consideration for the license granted under the Mirati License Agreement, we issued to Mirati 588,235 shares of our common stock in August 2020. The number of shares issued were based on a price of $34.00 per share, representing a premium of 10% to the 60-day trailing volume weighted average trading price of our common stock. As consideration for the license granted under the Voronoi License Agreement, we made a one-time $5.0 million cash payment in November 2020 and issued 283,259 shares of our common stock to Voronoi in October 2020. The number of shares issued were based on a price of $28.24 per share, representing a premium of 25% to the 30-day trailing volume weighted average trading price of our common stock. For a further description of these license agreements and related stock issuances, please refer to the “Business - Our collaboration and license agreements” and “Item 8 - Notes to Financial Statements” sections in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of Operating Results
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates.
External expenses include:
•
payments to third parties in connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, including contract research organizations (CROs) and consultants;
•
the cost of manufacturing products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including payments to contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and consultants;
•
payments to third parties in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates, including outsourced professional scientific development services, consulting research fees and for sponsored research arrangements with third parties;
•
laboratory supplies; and
•
allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for IT, rent and maintenance of facilities.
We may also incur in-process research and development expense as we acquire or in-license assets from other parties. Technology acquisitions are expensed or capitalized based upon the asset achieving technological feasibility in accordance with management’s assessment regarding the ultimate recoverability of the amounts paid and the potential for alternative future use. Acquired in-process research and development costs that have no alternative future use are immediately expensed.
Internal expenses include employee-related costs such as salaries, related benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions.
We expense research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. External expenses are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. We track external costs by program, clinical or preclinical. We do not track internal costs by program because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials; continue to discover and develop additional product candidates and expand our pipeline; maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, and we do not believe it is possible at this time to accurately project the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. To the extent our product candidates continue to advance into clinical trials, as well as advance into larger and later-stage clinical trials, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from our product candidates to offset these expenses. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•
establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies;
•
successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;
•
the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
our ability to establish licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•
the performance of our future collaborators, if any;
•
obtaining and retaining research and development personnel;
•
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
•
development and timely delivery of commercial-grade product formulations that can be used in our planned clinical trials and for commercial launch;
•
obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
•
launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•
maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following approval.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these factors could significantly impact the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance, not otherwise included in research and development expenses, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support the continued research and development of our programs and the growth of our business. We also anticipate increased expenses relating to accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance and investor and public relations costs associated with operating as a public company.
Total Other Income
Interest income, net primarily consists of interest income generated from our investments in interest-bearing money market accounts and marketable securities. Other income historically had consisted of rental income from the sub-leasing of a portion of our office space in South San Francisco, California. In August 2020, this sublease expired and we reclaimed the space at that time.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.1 million. This increase was primarily driven by $9.0 million of additional external costs primarily related to the continued advancement of our ORIC-101 program and our exploratory programs. Further, we incurred an additional $4.1 million in personnel costs, of which $1.5 million was non-cash stock-based compensation, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019.
We track external research and development costs by program, clinical or preclinical. External research and development expenses consist of payments to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs, clinical trial sites and central laboratories in connection with our discovery and preclinical activities, process development, clinical manufacturing and clinical development activities. External costs also include laboratory supplies as well as allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses. Included in preclinical and other unallocated costs are external corporate overhead costs that are not specific to any one program.
We do not track internal costs by program because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. Internal costs consist of employee-related costs including salaries, related benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions, which are not tracked by product candidate as several of our departments support multiple product candidate research and development programs.
The following table summarizes our external and internal costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, including investments in manufacturing, as our programs advance into later stages of development and as we conduct additional clinical trials.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
In August 2020, we acquired the rights to certain patents, patent applications and know-how from Mirati under the Mirati License Agreement. As consideration for the asset rights, we issued to Mirati 588,235 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $13.0 million based upon the closing price of our common stock on the acquisition date.
In October 2020, we also acquired the rights to certain patent applications and know-how from Voronoi under the Voronoi License Agreement. As consideration for the asset rights, we made an up-front cash payment to Voronoi of $5.0 million and issued to Voronoi 283,259 shares of the Company’s common stock issued, valued at approximately $6.8 million based upon the closing price of our common stock on the acquisition date.
As the assets licensed from Mirati and Voronoi were in early development at the time they were acquired, we concluded that there was no alternative future use for the assets and recorded the value of the asset rights acquired of $13.0 million and $11.8 million, from Mirati and Voronoi, respectively, to acquired in-process research and development at the closing of transactions, resulting in a total charge of $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $7.7 million. This increase was primarily due to $4.5 million higher personnel costs, including additional non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.6 million to support the growth of our company, and higher professional services and related costs to operate as a public company.
Total Other Income
Total other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.5 million, compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2019, a decrease of $1.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the interest income we earned on our cash reserves as a result of lower average interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.8 million. This increase was driven primarily by $2.6 million higher personnel costs related to the addition of a clinical development team and $1.2 million of external costs driven by progression of the ORIC-101 trials and ORIC-533 preclinical development.
The following table summarizes our external costs and internal costs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.4 million. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to hiring of additional employees and higher professional services.
Total Other Income
Total other income was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.7 million. This increase was primarily attributable to interest income as a result of higher cash balances from the Series C and Series D convertible preferred stock financings in 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
On April 28, 2020, we completed our IPO. In connection with our IPO, we issued and sold 8,625,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $16.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $138.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
On November 17, 2020, we completed follow-on offering of our common stock. In connection with our follow-on offering, we issued and sold 5,796,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $23.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $133.3 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
Prior to our IPO, we funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock resulting in total net proceeds of approximately $178.1 million.
Future Funding Requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if at all, that will occur. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Moreover, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the development of and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates. Further, we are subject to all the risks incident in the development of new pharmaceutical products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may harm our business. Our expenses will increase if, and as, we:
•
advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;
•
establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own or jointly;
•
expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company;
•
maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and
•
acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.
We expect our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan into the second half of 2023. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. In order to complete the development of our product candidates and to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates, we may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which could include income from collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties or from grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, including restricting our operations and limiting our ability to incur liens, issue additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in merger, consolidation, licensing or asset sale transactions. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic partnerships and other similar arrangements with third parties, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.
We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on our current operating plan, which is based on several assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount and timing of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the costs of manufacturing commercial-grade products and sufficient inventory to support commercial launch;
•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
•
the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
the ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and
•
the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other factors with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plan may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plan.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $45.3 million was primarily attributable to our net loss of $73.7 million, adjusted for addbacks for non-cash expenses of $26.4 million, which includes stock-based compensation of $5.3 million, depreciation of $1.0 million and non-cash stock consideration in acquisitions of $19.8 million and a net increase in working capital of $2.0 million.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $23.5 million was primarily attributable to our net loss of $26.9 million, adjusted for addbacks for non-cash expenses of $2.1 million, which includes stock-based compensation of $1.1 million and depreciation of $1.0 million and a net increase in working capital of $1.2 million.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $20.7 million was primarily attributable to our net loss of $21.4 million, adjusted for addbacks for non-cash expenses of $1.4 million, which includes stock-based compensation of $0.5 million and depreciation of $0.9 million and a net decrease in working capital of $0.7 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $216.0 million was primarily attributable to purchases of investments.
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $0.5 million was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from notes receivable.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $250.5 million for year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of net proceeds received from our IPO in April 2020 and net proceeds from our follow-on offering in November 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $70.9 million, primarily consisting of proceeds generated from the sale of shares of Series C and Series D convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $38.0 million, primarily consisting of proceeds of $37.9 million generated from the sale of shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs, and proceeds of $0.1 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1)
Reflects minimum payments due for offices and laboratory space in South San Francisco, California and San Diego, California leased under operating leases that expire in May 2022 and December 2021, respectively.
We lease certain office and lab space in South San Francisco, California under a non-cancelable operating lease, with a five-year term through May 2022 with an option to renew for an additional five-year term.
In March 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for office space in San Diego, California under a non-cancelable operating lease with a 13-month term. In October 2019, the lease was amended to increase the office space and extend the lease term until May 2021 and in November 2020, the lease was amended to extend the lease term until December 31, 2021. The minimum payments due under the amended lease total $0.2 million over the lease term.
Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Total rent expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.3 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
In addition, we have entered into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for preclinical research studies and testing, clinical trials and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior notice and, as a result, are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments above. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. We have entered into agreements with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which includes manufacturing services with CMOs and development services with CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payments for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amount of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreement.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not currently have, nor did we have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, during the periods presented.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our audited financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate research and development costs incurred during the period, which impacts the amount of accrued expenses and prepaid balances related to such costs as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and service providers to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
Research and development costs are expensed in the periods in which they are incurred. External costs consist primarily of payments to outside consultants, third-party CROs, CMOs, clinical trial sites and central laboratories in connection with our discovery and preclinical activities, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. External costs also include laboratory supplies as well as allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses. External expenses are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. We allocate external costs by program, clinical or preclinical. Internal costs consist primary of employee-related costs including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions. We do not allocate internal costs by program because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified.
We make estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee, officer, director and non-employee stock option grants, estimated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The vesting period generally approximates the expected service period of the awards. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.
The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires inputs based on certain highly subjective assumptions. Changes to these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of stock options and ultimately the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. These assumptions include:
Fair value of common stock-Prior to our IPO, as there had been no public market for our common stock, the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors primarily based on valuations of our common stock prepared by a third-party valuation firm using the option pricing method (OPM) and a hybrid method of OPM and the probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM) with discounts for lack of marketability and potential liquidation events in periods through August 2019, and PWERM beginning in November 2019. Subsequent to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based upon the closing market price on the date of grant.
Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities similar to the expected term of our stock options.
Expected volatility-Due to our limited operating history and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
Expected term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have opted to use the “simplified method” for estimating the expected term of options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, which is generally 10 years.
Expected dividend yield-To date, we have not issued any dividends and do not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options and therefore have estimated the dividend yield to be zero.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represent our board’s and management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our audited financial statements.
Emerging Growth Company Status
Section 107 of the JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition time to comply with new or revised accounting standards as applicable to public companies. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (1) are no longer an emerging growth company and (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700.0 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) December 31, 2025.
