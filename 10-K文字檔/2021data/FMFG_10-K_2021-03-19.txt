ITEM 7:
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which are presented elsewhere in this annual report.
The Company was incorporated on August 8, 2016 for the purpose of becoming the bank holding company of the Bank in a share exchange transaction that was intended to constitute a tax-free exchange under Section 351 of the IRC. This reorganization was consummated on November 1, 2016, at which time the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and all of the Bank’s stockholders became stockholders of the Company by virtue of the conversion of their shares of common stock of the Bank into an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company. Although we use the terms “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” in this section of the annual report, the discussion and analysis with respect to periods ending prior to November 1, 2016 relate to the operations of the Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the discussion and analysis with respect to periods ending on and after November 1, 2016 relate to the operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Bank.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the industry in which the Company operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.
The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in the annual report. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses as the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.
The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses.
Management applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as most investment securities. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. In addition to valuation, we must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statements of income. Examples include investment securities, goodwill and core deposit intangible, among others.
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The COVID-19 pandemic has been wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy since the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The full impact and its effect on the banking industry, including the Company, will not be known for several quarters, but will be significant.
The U.S. and state governments reacted to the outbreak of the pandemic by issuing shelter-at-home orders and requiring that non-essential businesses be closed to prevent spread of the virus. The health crisis quickly turned into a financial crisis resulting in guidance and mandates regarding foreclosures and repossessions and accounting and regulatory changes designed to encourage banks to work with customers suffering detrimental financial impact.
Although states, including Maryland, have eased several of the COVID-19 restrictions, including stay-at-home orders and the required closure of non-essential businesses, there appears to be a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many states, including Maryland. As a result, it is possible that states, including Maryland, will re-implement some or all of the COVID-19 related restrictions and again require some or all non-essential businesses to close or drastically alter their business operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our customers and, thus, our financial condition and results of operations.
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM
The U.S. Government’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, as amended (the “CARES Act”) established the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which provides small businesses with resources to maintain payroll, hire back employees who may have been laid off, and to cover applicable overhead expenses. Following the enactment of the CARES Act and the establishment of the PPP, we acted expeditiously to prepare our associates so they could guide our customers on the proper procedures necessary to enable them to take advantage of this program. We developed a PPP specific information site within our website that provided detailed information, links and materials for eligible customers to access. Internally, we reallocated resources to review, process and data enter customer applications, working tirelessly over extended hours to provide access to as many local business owners as possible. We were able to fund 172 loan applications for approximately $25.3 million from the first tranche of PPP designated funds. Congress allocated additional funding to the PPP on April 23, 2020, and we were able to gain approval for an additional 101 loan applications for approximately $5.8 million through December 31, 2020. During 2020, we gained approval for over $31 million to 273 small businesses. Approximately 70% of the loans were under $100,000 in size. All PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, have up to a five-year maturity (the majority of our PPP originations have a two-year maturity), provide for a six-month deferral period, and have an interest rate of 1%. These loans may be forgiven by the SBA if the borrower meets certain conditions, including by using at least 75% of the loan proceeds for payroll costs. The SBA also established processing fees from 1% to 5%, depending on the loan amount. During 2020, we received $1,285,719 in fees which, net of related origination costs, will be amortized into interest income over the life of the loans. On December 27, 2020, Congress allocated additional funding to the PPP. Through February 24, 2021, we have gained approval for 121 loans applications for approximately $18.4 million from the third tranche of PPP designated funds.
In April 2020, the Bank established eligibility to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”), which was established by Congress and administered by the Federal Reserve Bank. This facility uses the SBA guaranteed PPP loans as collateral, offering 100% collateral coverage with no recourse to the Bank. The majority of the PPP loan disbursements were to internal, non-interest-bearing accounts for use by borrowers. As a result, we have not yet accessed the PPPLF, but are prepared to utilize the fund when management determines the timing is appropriate.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Effective on October 1, 2020, the Company consummated its previously-announced acquisition of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Carroll Community Bank (collectively, “Carroll”) in a series of merger transactions (the “Merger”) pursuant to which the stockholders of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. received cash in the aggregate amount of $24.8 million in exchange for their shares of common stock of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. The merger consideration was paid by the Company using $7.8 million in cash and $17 million in proceeds from a third-party term loan obtained in connection with the Merger. At the Effective Time of the Merger, Carroll had total assets of $176,159,890, net loans of $145,153,100, and total liabilities of $157,992,286, of which $144,896,990 represented deposits. The Merger was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values at the effective time of the Merger.
The following table presents the book values and fair values of the assets, liabilities, and equity of Carroll at the effective time of the Merger:
Total assets were $667,317,082 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $235,101,984, or 53.2%, over the $442,215,098 recorded at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $162,307,671 in loans, and increase of $31,854,318 in cash and cash equivalents, and an increase of $21,514,013 in securities available for sale and held for maturity. A significant portion of these increases was due to the Merger and the origination of the PPP loans.
Total liabilities were $625,587,599 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $232,826.017, or 59.3%, over the $392,761,582 recorded at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $196,788,233 in deposits, an increase of $13,795,854 of securities sold under repurchase agreements, and an increase of $16,973,280 in long-term debt. The increase in deposits was comprised of a $42,496,098 increase in noninterest-bearing accounts and a $154,292,135 increase in interest-bearing accounts. A significant portion of the increases in deposits was due to the Merger and the deposits generated from the PPP loans.
Stockholders’ equity was $51,729,483 at December 31, 2020 compared to $49,453,516 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $2,275,967. The increase was due primarily to net income for 2020 of $2,682,003 and an increase in the after-tax unrealized gain on available for sale securities of $663,653, offset by dividends paid, net of reinvestments, of $1,069,689.
Loans
Major categories of loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, are as follows:
The Company had no foreign loans for any of the years presented.
Loans increased by $162,307,671, or 45.2%, to $521,690,514 at December 31, 2020 from $359,382,843 at December 31, 2019. The growth was due primarily to increases in commercial real estate loans of $33,563,178, commercial loans of $34,420,602, residential real estate loans of $79,989,176, and construction/land development loans of $15,446,961. The allowance for loan losses increased $702,823 to $3,296,538 at December 31, 2020 as compared to $2,593,715 at December 31, 2019.
Commercial loans in the table above include $32,071,443 of Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans at December 31, 2020, which are 100% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). A substantial portion of the PPP loans in the Company’s portfolio at December 31, 2020 are expected to be forgiven by the SBA. During the year-ended December 31, 2020, the Company collected approximately $1,286,000 in fees from the SBA in connection with the originations of the PPP loans. The fees, net of related origination costs, are being recognized as interest income over the term of the loans using the straight-line method, with accelerated recognition when the loan pays off before maturity through SBA forgiveness or by other means.
The Company has adopted policies and procedures that seek to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio. These policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. These policies, coupled with continuous training efforts, have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process. Lending authority is based on the level of risk, size of the loan, and the experience of the lending officer. The Company’s policy is to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves. Management believes that this tends to reduce risk because management is familiar with the credit histories of loan applicants and has in-depth knowledge of the risk to which a given credit is subject. Although the loan portfolio is diversified, its performance will be influenced by the economy of the region.
An age analysis of past due loans, segregated by class of loans, as of year-end, is as follows:
It is the Company’s policy to place a loan in nonaccrual status when any portion of the principal or interest is 90 days past due unless there are mitigating factors. Management closely monitors nonaccrual loans. The Company returns a nonaccrual loan to accruing status when (i) the loan is brought current with the full payment of all principal and interest arrearages, (ii) all contractual payments are thereafter made on a timely basis for at least six months, and (iii) management determines, based on a credit review, that it is reasonable to expect that future payments will be made as and when required by the contract.
Year-end non-accrual loans, segregated by class of loans, were as follows:
At December 31, 2020, the Company had one nonaccrual commercial real estate loan totaling $4,407,829 and two nonaccrual residential real estate loans totaling $220,967. The loans were secured by real estate, business assets and a personal guaranty. Gross interest income of $13,395 would have been recorded in 2020 if these nonaccrual loans had been current and performing in accordance with the original terms. The Company allocated $0 of its allowance for loan losses to these nonaccrual loans. The balance of the nonaccrual loans was net of charge-offs and a nonaccretable discount totaling $8,176 at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had no nonaccrual loans.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had no loans that were delinquent 90 days or greater other than the nonaccrual loans listed above. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no loans that were delinquent 90 days or greater.
Year-end impaired loans are set forth in the following table:
Impaired loans include certain loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Company’s loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower’s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had two commercial real estate loans totaling $2,252,316 and one residential loan totaling $44,733 classified as TDRs. One of the commercial real estate loans with a principal balance of $182,656 was restructured as a TDR during 2020. All three loans are included in impaired loans above. Each loan is paying as agreed. There have been no charge-offs or allowances associated with these three loans.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had one commercial real estate loan totaling $2,084,988 and one residential loan totaling $50,057 classified as TDRs. Both are included in impaired loans above. Each loan is paying as agreed. There have been no charge-offs or allowances associated with these two loans.
Year-end TDRs are set forth in the following table:
Section 4013 of the U.S. Government’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act allows financial institutions to suspend application of certain current TDR accounting guidance under ASC 310-40 for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency, provided certain criteria are met. This relief can be applied to loan modifications for borrowers that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and to loan modifications that defer or delay the payment of principal or interest, or change the interest rate on the loan. In April 2020, federal and state banking regulators issued the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus to provide further interpretation of when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, specifically indicating that if the modification is either short-term (e.g., six months) or mandated by a federal or state government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulty under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310-40. The Company continues to prudently work with borrowers who have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic while managing credit risks and recognizing appropriate allowance for loan losses on its loan portfolio. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company modified loans, due to the pandemic and at the borrower’s request, with an aggregate principal balance of $109.2 million, or 30% of its loan portfolio. During the third quarter of 2020, $21.8 million of these previously-deferred loans were granted additional three-month deferrals, which amount represented 6% of the Company’s loan portfolio. At December 31, 2020, five of these previously-deferred loans along with two loans acquired in the Merger totaling $14.7 million in the aggregate, or 3% of the portfolio, had been granted additional payment deferrals. None of these loans were classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2020 because they met the criteria discussed above.
As part of our portfolio risk management, the Company assigns a risk grade to each loan. The factors used to determine the grade are the payment history of the loan and the borrower, the value of the collateral and net worth of any guarantor, and cash flow projections of the borrower. Special mention, Substandard, and Doubtful grades are assigned to loans with a higher frequency of delinquent payments and/or the collateral and/or cash flow are insufficient to support the loan and such loans are included on the Company’s watch list. The Special mention grade is intended to be a temporary grade.
Year-end loans graded special mention, substandard and doubtful are set forth in the following table:
The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses and is charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses represents an amount which, in management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans and other extensions of credit that may become uncollectible. The Company's allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, "Receivables" and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, "Contingencies." Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit and internal risk grade, specific homogeneous risk pools and specific loss allocations, with adjustments for current events and conditions.
The Company's process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, classified and criticized loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.
Although management believes, based on currently available information, that the Company’s allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time, no assurances can be given that the Company’s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the Company or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions at the time management determined the current level of the allowance for loan losses.
The following tables detail activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.
The Company recorded net recoveries of $77,823 and $44,381 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The provision for loan losses was $625,000 in 2020 and $40,000 in 2019.
Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned (“OREO”) at December 31, 2020 included two properties with an aggregate carrying value of $1,411,605. The first property is an apartment building in Baltimore, Maryland with a carrying value of $1,411,605 that was obtained in the Merger. The property is under an optional sales contract with no projected closing date. The other property is land in Cecil County, Maryland with a carrying value of $0. It was acquired through foreclosure in 2007. The latter property consists of 10.43 acres and is currently under contract for a gross sales price of $295,000 with closing expected in 2021. Due to the length of time the property has been held, Maryland banking law required a write-down of the value to $0 in 2019.
Investment Securities
Investment securities increased $21,514,013, or 38.4%, to $77,555,805 at December 31, 2020 from $56,041,792 at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had classified 70% and 65%, respectively, of the investment portfolio as available for sale. The remaining balance of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity.
Securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the Company’s asset/liability management strategy. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of income taxes. Securities classified as held to maturity, which management has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. The Company does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view to near-term sales, and, therefore, does not own trading securities. The Company manages the investment portfolio within policies that seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity, manage interest rate sensitivity, meet earnings objectives, and provide required collateral for deposit and borrowing activities.
The following table sets forth the carrying value of investment securities at December 31:
The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of investment securities at December 31, 2020:
SBA pools and mortgage-backed securities are due in monthly installments.
Deposits
Total deposits were $573,401,547 at December 31, 2020 compared to $376,613,314 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $196,788,233, or 52.3%. The increase was due to a $47,092,893 increase in certificates of deposit, a $33,318,417 increase in savings accounts, a $44,464,294 increase in interest bearing checking accounts, a $29,416,531 increase in money market accounts and a $42,496,098 increase in noninterest-bearing accounts. The following table shows the average balances and average costs of deposits for the years ended December 31:
As of December 31, 2020, certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more mature as follows:
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, lines of credit, including home-equity lines and commercial lines, and letters of credit. Loan commitments generally have interest rates at current market values, fixed expiration dates, and may require a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates and do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will draw upon their lines in full at any one time. Letters of credit are commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.
For commitments to extend credit, lines of credit, and letters of credit, the Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments were as follows:
Management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements are reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Borrowings and Other Contractual Obligations
The Company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of borrowings and operating leases for various facilities.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent overnight borrowings from customers. Securities owned by the Company which are used as collateral for these borrowings are primarily U.S. government agency securities.
On September 30, 2020, the Company borrowed $17,000,000 from First Horizon Bank (“FHN”) to be used in the Merger on October 1, 2020. Net of issuance costs of $28,126, the proceeds of the net long-term debt was $16,971,874. The loan matures on September 30, 2025. The interest rate on the loan is fixed at 4.10%. The Company is required to make quarterly interest-only payments through October 1, 2021. The Company expects that the amount of these quarterly interest-only payments will be $174,250. During the remaining term of the loan, the Company is required to make quarterly interest and principal payments of approximately $646,472, which will be based on a nine-year straight-line amortization schedule. The remaining balance of approximately $9,916,667 will be due at maturity. To secure its obligations under this loan, the Company pledged all of its shares of common stock of the Bank to the lender.
Specific information about the Company’s borrowings and contractual obligations is set forth in the following table:
The terms of the Company’s operating leases, including the future minimum payments under those leases, are disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
The Company reported net income of $2,682,003 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4,560,804 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $1,878,801 from 2019 was due to an increase in noninterest expense of $4,706,594 and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $585,000, offset by an increase in net interest income of $2,282,118, an increase in noninterest income of $578,552, and a decrease in income taxes of $552,123. Included in noninterest expense was $3,236,817 of one-time expenses incurred in connection with the Merger. Without these acquisition costs, net income would have been $5,113,225 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The table below provides a comparison of the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, both with and without the acquisition costs.
Net Interest Income
The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing sources of funds, such as deposits and borrowings.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded net interest income of $17,304,503 compared to $15,022,385 for 2019, an increase of $2,282,118. The increase was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $85,331,237 to $500,045,945 in 2020 from $414,714,708 in 2019, offset by a decline in the net yield on interest-earning assets of 17 basis points to 3.50% in 2020 from 3.67% in 2019.
Total interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $2,060,842 to $20,763,180, from $18,702,338 for 2019. The increase was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in average interest earning assets, offset by a decrease of 36 basis points in the tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets to 4.19% in 2020 from 4.55% in 2019.
Interest income from loans was $19,291,162 in 2020 compared to $16,894,657 in 2019, an increase of $2,396,505. This increase was attributable to a $76,216,697 increase in the average balance of loans to $421,010,433 in 2020 from $344,793,736 in 2019, offset by a 32 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to 4.58% in 2020 from 4.90% in 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded interest income on securities of $1,395,493. For the same period of 2019, interest income on securities was $1,449,841. The $54,348 decrease in 2020 was attributable to a 65 basis point decrease in the average tax equivalent yield on securities to 2.40% in 2020 from 3.05% in 2019, offset by a $12,534,077 increase in the average balance of securities to $65,583,845 in 2020 from $53,049,768 in 2019.
Interest income on federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets (FHLB stock and certificates of deposit) decreased $281,315 to $76,525 in 2020 compared to $357,840 in 2019. The decrease was due to a 1.62% decrease in the average tax equivalent yield to 0.59% in 2020 from 2.21% in 2019, and a $3,419,537 decrease in the average balance of federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets to $13,451,667 in 2020 from $16,871,204 in 2019.
Total interest expense decreased $221,276 to $3,458,677 in 2020 compared to $3,679,953 in 2019. The decrease was due to a 26 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 0.89% in 2020 from 1.15% in 2019, offset by an increase of $67,972,598 in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $388,143,480 in 2020 from $320,170,882 in 2019.
Interest paid on NOW, savings, and money market deposit accounts increased $11,633 to $519,018 in 2020 compared to $507,385 in 2019. The increase was due to a $45,200,261 increase in the average balance of these deposits to $203,426,815 in 2020 from $158,226,554 in 2019, offset by a 6 basis point decrease in the cost of funds to 0.26% in 2020 from 0.32% in 2019.
Interest paid on time deposits decreased $402,599 to $2,609,976 in 2020 compared to $3,012,575 in 2019. The decrease was due to a decrease of 44 basis points in the average rate paid to 1.57% in 2020 from 2.01% in 2019, offset by an increase of $16,108,733 in the average balance to $166,078,044 in 2020 from $149,969,311 in 2019.
Interest paid on securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased $7,323 to $107,318 in 2020 compared to $114,641 in 2019. The decrease was attributable to a decrease of 9 basis points in the average rate to 1.15% in 2020 from 1.24% in 2019, offset by a $62,501 increase in the average balance of securities sold under repurchase agreements to $9,335,593 in 2020 from $9,273,092 in 2019,
Interest paid on long-term debt that was $181,465 in 2020 compared to $0 in 2019. This debt relates to the $17 million term loan obtained in 2020 to finance a portion of the cash paid to the former stockholders of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. in the Merger.
Interest paid on FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased $4,452 to $40,900 in 2020 from $45,352 in 2019. The decrease was attributable to a decrease of 84 basis points in the average rate to 0.84% in 2020 from 1.68% in 2019, offset by a $2,175,127 increase in the average balance of FHLB advances and other borrowings to $4,877,052 in 2020 from $2,701,925 in 2019.
The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company’s average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. The yields are calculated by dividing interest income or expense by the average daily balance of assets or liabilities, respectively. Non-accruing loans are included in the average balance.
Interest on tax-exempt investments are reported on a fully taxable equivalent basis
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table distinguishes between (i) changes in net interest income attributed to volume (change in volume multiplied by the prior year's interest rate), and (ii) changes in net interest income attributed to rate (change in rate multiplied by the prior year's volume). The change in interest due to the combined rate and volume changes is allocated proportionally to the change in volume and rate.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $2,072,119 in 2020 compared to $1,493,567 in 2019, an increase of $578,552 or 38.7%. The increase resulted primarily from a $627,227 increase in mortgage banking income and a $210,150 lower write down of OREO, offset by decreases of $176,586 in bank owned life insurance income and $88,245 in service charges on deposit accounts. Our mortgage banking division has experienced strong mortgage origination activity during 2020 as a result of historically low interest rates. Lower service charges are a result of less customer transaction activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased by $4,706,594, or 43.3%, to $15,582,408 in 2020 from $10,875,814 in 2019. The increase was due primarily to $3,236,817 in acquisition-related costs in 2020, an increase in salary and employee benefit expenses of $970,890, or 14.2%, to $7,795,701 in 2020, an increase in furniture and equipment expenses of $226,347, or 36.8%, and an increase in other expenses of $286,100, or 10.7%. All of these increases resulted from the Merger that was effective on October 1, 2020, which added employees, locations, and related expenses. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the Company’s other expenses.
Income Taxes
Income taxes decreased $552,123 to $487,211 in 2020 from $1,039,334 in 2019. Lower income before taxes was the primary driver of the decrease.
The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 15.4% in 2020, from 18.6% in 2019. The decrease was due to a higher percentage of tax-exempt revenue. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the Company’s taxes, including a reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rate to the Federal statutory rate of 21%.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Company’s principal market risk is exposure to the risk that the interest rates associated with our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets will fluctuate. This risk arises from the Company’s lending, investing and deposit-taking activities, and is affected by many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences. Interest rate fluctuation has a direct impact on the Company’s net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk when deposits and other short-term liabilities have different repricing intervals than do loans, investments and other interest-earning assets. When interest-earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest-bearing liabilities, a decline in interest rates may cause a decline in net interest income. Conversely, when interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice faster than interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates may cause a decline in net interest income.
The Company recognizes that there are many types of interest rate risk. Management believes that the three types that pose the greatest potential threat to current and long-term earnings are:
•
Repricing risk - the difference in the timing of the scheduled maturity and re-pricing dates of assets and liabilities within a certain time frame;
•
Option risk - interest rate related options embedded in the Company’s assets and liabilities which change the cash flow characteristics of the assets and liabilities; and
•
Yield curve / basis risk - changes in the relationship between different interest rates with the same maturity or interest rates across a maturity spectrum which create compression or expansion of our net interest margin.
The Company uses earnings at risk and economic value at risk measures to quantify our exposure to these types of interest rate risk. We believe that using simulations that measure all three types of risks in combination is a more efficient tool for measurement, and we therefore do not routinely process models to isolate each risk. Rather, we combine the three types of analyses, which we believe provides a better overall result than a simulation based on a single system and a more economical use of resources than targeted models. Following is a description of the analyses to be utilized:
Earnings at Risk
Earnings at Risk (“EAR”) measures exposure to net changes in net interest income (“NII”), and is considered the Company’s best source of managing short-term interest rate risk (one-year and two-year time frames). EAR is a dynamic analysis, which can capture all the different forms of interest rate risk under many different interest rate scenarios, and using various assumptions for growth, optionality, and yield curve structure.
Economic Value of Equity
Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) is management’s primary analytical tool for measuring long-term interest rate risk, and helps to measure if the long-term safety and soundness of the Company is being compromised for the sake of short-term results. However, the Company also recognizes the inherent difficulties of calculating a definitive value for many sections of the balance sheet as well as the weakness that EVE ignores future events (e.g., growth, etc.). These difficulties, coupled with the nature of our core business, allow the Company to adopt wide limits for this measure.
In order to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates, the Board of Directors has established policies and procedures that include acceptable parameters for the relationship between rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities as measured by earnings at risk and economic value at risk. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews rate sensitivity measures on a quarterly basis. Material deviations from policy parameters are reported to the Board of Directors and corrective action is initiated and monitored.
Measures of NII at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution’s short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.
Based upon the simulation analysis performed at December 31, 2020 and 2019, management estimated the following changes in NII, assuming the indicated rate changes:
LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
Liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise out of the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet depositor withdrawal requirements, to fund loans, and to fund our other debts and obligations as they come due in the normal course of business. We maintain our asset liquidity position internally through short-term investments, the maturity distribution of the investment portfolio, loan repayments, and income from earning assets. On the liability side of the balance sheet, liquidity is affected by the timing of maturing liabilities and the ability to generate new deposits or borrowings as needed. The Bank is approved to borrow 75% of eligible pledged single family residential loans and 50% of eligible pledged commercial loans as well as investment securities, or approximately $89.3 million under a secured line of credit with the FHLB. The Bank also has a facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the “Reserve Bank”) under which the Bank could borrow approximately $33.2 million. Finally, the Bank has $23,500,000 ($14,500,000 unsecured and $9,000,000 secured) overnight federal funds lines of credit available from commercial banks. FHLB advances of $5,000,000 and $0 were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no borrowings from the Reserve Bank or from the commercial banks’ lines of credit at December 31, 2020 and 2019. On September 30, 2020, the Company borrowed $17,000,000 from a commercial bank, which was used on October 1, 2020 to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to the former stockholders of Carroll Bancorp, Inc. in the Merger. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2020, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $16,973,280. Management believes that we have adequate liquidity sources to meet all anticipated liquidity needs over the next 12 months. Management knows of no trend or event which is likely to have a material impact on our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels.
Information about the various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments, to which we are subject is set forth above under the captions “Off-Balance Sheet Transactions” and “Borrowings and Other Contractual Obligations”.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND ADEQUACY
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possible additional, discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). Quantitative measures established by the Basel III Capital Rules to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined).
Additional information regarding the capital requirements that apply to us can be found in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report.
The following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, for the Bank under the Basel III Capital Rules. The minimum required capital amounts presented include the minimum required capital levels as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, based on the phase-in provisions of the Basel III Capital Rules. Capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III Capital Rules.
The Company intends to fund future growth primarily with cash, federal funds, maturities of investment securities and deposit growth. Management knows of no other trend or event that will have a material impact on capital.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Management has the responsibility for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the Company are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The following accounting guidance has been approved by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and would apply to the Company if the Company entered into an applicable activity.
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses”. The ASU sets forth a “current expected credit loss” (CECL) model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. ASU 2019-10 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates” extended the implementation date to 2023 for SEC registered smaller reporting companies and private companies. The Company is considered a smaller reporting company. The Company has engaged a third-party vendor to assist in the implementation of this ASU.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20).” ASU 2018-14 amends and modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans. The amendments in this update remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosures, and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. ASU 2018-14 will be effective for us on January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 clarifies certain aspects of ASU 2015-05, “Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,” which was issued in April 2015. Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 does not affect the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 became effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In December 2019, FASB released ASU 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing multiple exceptions to the general principals in Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is in the process of reviewing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s financial statements.
The accounting policies adopted by management are consistent with authoritative GAAP and are consistent with those followed by our peers.
