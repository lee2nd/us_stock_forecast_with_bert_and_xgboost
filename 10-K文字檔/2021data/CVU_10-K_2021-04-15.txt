Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Recent Developments
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan
On April 10, 2020, we entered into the PPP Loan, with BNB Bank (now part of Dime Community Bank) as the Lender, in an aggregate principal amount of $4,795,000, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. The PPP Loan is evidenced by the Note. Subject to the terms of the Note, the PPP Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of one percent (1%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred, has an initial term of two years, and is unsecured and guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The Note provides for customary events of default including, among other things, cross-defaults on any other loan with the Lender. The PPP Loan may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
On November 2, 2020 the Company applied to the Lender for full forgiveness of the PPP Loan, calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act, as modified by the Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act. We were notified by our lender that our application was accepted and forwarded to the SBA, from whom, we are currently awaiting a response. To date the lender has not requested payment of any interest or principal.
Impact of COVID-19
The impact that the recent COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business is uncertain. Our staff has been working modified hours and remotely due to social distancing protocols and concern over their safety and the safety of others since on or about March 19, 2019.
During late 2020, we began to experience an increased rate of employees testing positive for COVID-19 and we took steps to mitigate virus transmission within the workplace. These steps included adding a second manufacturing shift to lessen employee density on the manufacturing floor and to require most non-manufacturing personnel to work from home. These measures continued into the current year. We believe it is possible that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial position and cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2021, particularly in the first fiscal quarter. We have taken mitigating steps in an attempt to reduce the adverse effects. For example, we have curtailed discretionary spending, deferred all business travel, and taken other steps to preserve cash. We have also taken action to more closely manage the flow of materials to be more responsive to unanticipated changes in customer delivery schedules.
Certain Transactions
The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:
Acquisition of WMI
In December 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of WMI from Air Industries for a purchase price of $7.9 million, subject to a potential post-closing working capital adjustment. Of the purchase price, $2 million was placed in escrow at closing and was to be released after the completion of the working capital adjustment and for indemnification contingencies. Air Industries objected to the Company’s calculation of the post-closing working capital adjustment and rejected the determination of BDO USA, LLP (“BDO”), the independent accountant appointed by the parties to resolve the dispute. On September 27, 2019, the Company filed a notice of motion in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, against Air Industries seeking, among other things, a judgment against Air Industries in the amount of approximately $4.1 million. In October 2019, Air Industries and the Company jointly authorized the release to the Company of approximately $619,000 from escrow, which represented the value of certain undisputed items. The remaining escrowed amount of approximately $1,381,000 is shown as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. The additional disputed amount of approximately $2.1 million is not on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of collection.
The Company and Air Industries entered into a settlement agreement dated as of December 23, 2020, to resolve the post-closing working capital adjustment dispute in exchange for the release to the Company of the $1,381,000 cash remaining in escrow. Such amount was released from escrow to the Company on December 28, 2020. As part of the settlement agreement CPI agreed to give up the right to pursue the additional disputed working capital amount of approximately $2.1 million.
Honda Aircraft Company, Inc. Settlement and Release Agreement
In January 2020, the Company requested a modification to the recurring sales price contained in the Master Purchase Agreement dated January 14, 2019 (“Honda MPA”) with Honda Aircraft Company, Inc. (“HACI”) for the manufacture of engine inlet assemblies for the HondaJet aircraft. HACI denied the Company’s request. HACI and the Company subsequently commenced discussions that would result in the Company exiting the program. On December 23, 2020 HACI and the Company entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement that, subject to the terms and conditions therein, terminates the Honda MPA and cancels all remaining purchase orders placed with the Company thereunder.
Business Operations
We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters in both the commercial and defense markets. We also have a strong and growing presence in the aerosystems segment of the market, with our production of various reconnaissance pod structures and fuel panel systems. Within the global aerostructure and aerosystem supply chain, we are either a Tier 1 supplier to aircraft OEMs or a Tier 2 subcontractor to major Tier 1 manufacturers. We also are a prime contractor to the U.S. DOD, primarily the USAF. In conjunction with our assembly operations, we provide engineering, program management, supply chain management and kitting, and MRO services.
Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective method. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the good or service. The majority of the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as the Company (i) sells products with no alternative use to the Company and (ii) has an enforceable right to recover costs incurred plus a reasonable profit margin for work completed to date. Under the over time revenue recognition model, revenue and gross profit are recognized over the contract period as work is performed based on actual costs incurred and an estimate of costs to complete and resulting total estimated costs at completion.
See Note 3 “Revenue”, for additional information regarding the Company's revenue recognition policy.
Leases
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases (“ASC 842”)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease standard using the optional transition method under which comparative financial information will not be restated and continue to apply the provisions of the previous lease standard in its annual disclosures for the comparative periods. In addition, the new lease standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company elected the package of practical expedients. As such, the Company did not have to reassess whether expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease; did not have to reassess the lease classifications or reassess the initial direct costs associated with expired or existing leases.
ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption under which the Company will not recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets (office building).
On January 1, 2019, the Company recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $5.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet using an estimated incremental borrowing rate of 6%. As of December 31, 2020 the Company has ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $4.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU-2017-04). ASU 2017-04 is intended to simplify how all entities assess goodwill for impairment. This is accomplished by removing the requirement to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities in order to calculate a reporting unit’s “implied” goodwill. The goodwill impairment test consists of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.
An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. However, the ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to perform a qualitative assessment for any reporting unit with zero or negative carrying amount. The Company adopted ASU-2017-4 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Results of Operations
The following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $87,584,690 compared to $87,518,688 for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $66,002. We experienced revenue increases on our E2-D wing panel kits, our Pacer Classic III Phase 2 program with USAF as this effort transitions to Phase 3, and our Lockheed Martin Rudder Island program. The revenue increases were partially offset by decreases on our Raytheon NGJ Pod program as we transitioned to our follow on order, and on the G650 fixed leading edge program.
Overall, revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9,115,983 compared to $6,429,860 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2,686,123. This increase is primarily a result of increased revenue recognized on the T-38C Pacer Classic phase 2 aircraft structural modification program which is transitioning from Phase 2 to Phase 3. CPI Aero was awarded the Phase 3 contract in 2019.
Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $70,106,741 compared to $62,319,526 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $7,787,215. The increase in revenue related to the start of a new multi-year award for the Northrop Grumman E2D program as well as increases related to the NGC WOWP, and the Rudder Island program, offset by a decrease in the Raytheon NGJ Pod program as described above.
Revenue generated from commercial contracts was $8,361,966 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $18,769,302 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $10,407,336. Most of this decrease resulted from decreased production of the Gulfstream G650 fixed leading edge assembly. We also had year-over-year revenue declines in our program with Honda as we negotiated an exit to this unprofitable program. Revenue from Embraer also declined largely due to decreased business jet demand.
Cost of sales. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $75,490,503 and $78,386,997, respectively, a decrease of $2,896,494 or 4%.
The components of cost of sales were as follows:
Procurement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $56,093,073 compared to $49,920,962 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $6,172,111 or 12%. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in procurement for the E2D and WOWP programs.
Labor costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $6,063,509 compared to $7,778,571 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of ($1,715,062) or 22%. The decrease is primarily the result of the absence in 2020 of labor associated with the NGJ pod program, which was very labor intensive, as well as lower labor on the HondaJet and G650 programs.
Factory overhead costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $20,003,530 compared to $20,726,990 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of ($723,460) or 3%. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in factory supplies.
Other cost of sales relates to items that can increase or decrease cost of sales such as changes in inventory levels, changes in inventory valuation, changes to inventory reserves, changes in loss contract provisions, absorption variances and direct charges to cost of sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020 there was a reduction of costs in the amount of ($6,669,609) primarily the result of changes in inventory levels and reductions in loss contract reserves.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12,094,187 compared to $9,131,691 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2,962,496. Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 13.8% compared to 10.4% for the same period last year. The increase was primarily on our E2-D kitting programs which experienced a growth in revenue as well as our exit from unprofitable programs, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit on our Raytheon Pod program due to lower volumes.
Favorable/Unfavorable Adjustments to Gross Profit
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we made changes in estimates to various contracts. Such changes in estimates resulted in changes in total gross profit as follows:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $12,046,170 compared to $11,562,781 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $483,389 or 4.2%. This increase was primarily due to increased legal and accounting expenses compared to the prior period associated with the prior restatement of our consolidated financial statements for several prior periods.
Interest expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,421,955, compared to $2,104,851 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $682,896 or 32%. The decrease in interest expense is the result of continued principal repayment on our term loan with BankUnited, lower overall interest rates and a favorable 1% interest rate on our PPP loan with the SBA which we are accruing but not paying. If the PPP Loan is forgiven, the accrual will be reversed.
Profit/ (Loss) from operations
We had a profit from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $48,017 compared to a loss from operations of (2,431,090) for the year ended December 31, 2019. This improvement was primarily the result of higher revenue and gross profit on the E2D program and the exit from unprofitable programs.
Provision (Benefit) for income taxes. The income tax (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was ($53,500), an effective tax rate of 3.09%. The tax benefit consists of a refund received from the 2014 NOL carryback claim and state minimum taxes. In February 2019, the Company received information that the net operating loss carryback that was utilized in 2014 was under examination and could possibly be partially disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). This adjustment was an issue of timing of the loss and had no income tax provision effect. In June 2020, the Company received a letter from the IRS stating that the returns will be accepted as filed. In September 2020, the Company received additional refunds related to the tax years under examination. The examination is now closed and there is no uncertain tax position recorded for this item.
Business Outlook
The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General. At December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $12,309,372 compared to working capital of $13,851,717 at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,542,345, or 11.1%. This decrease is primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Cash Flow. A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments. Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of contract assets on our consolidated balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed. These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.
Because ASC 606 requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period. Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money or take steps to defer cash outflows until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.
Several of our programs require us to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units. In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could experience margin degradation, which may be material for costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations.
We continue to work to obtain better payment terms with our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternative funding sources.
At December 31, 2020, our cash balance was $6,033,537 compared to $4,052,109 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,981,428. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2020 decreased to $4,962,906 from $7,029,602 at December 31, 2019.
Bank Credit Facilities
BankUnited: On March 24, 2016, the Company entered into the BankUnited Facility. The Credit Agreement entered into in connection with the BankUnited Facility provided for a revolving credit loan commitment of $30 million (the “Revolving Loan”) and a $10 million term loan (“Term Loan”). The Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate as defined in the Credit Agreement.
On August 24, 2020, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Under the Sixth Amendment, the parties amended the Credit Agreement by extending the maturity date of the Company’s Revolving Loan and Term Loan to May 2, 2022 and making conforming changes to the repayment schedule of the Term Loan, by increasing the Term Loan $6.0 million and reducing the Revolving Loan by $6.0 million. The maturities of the Term Loan are included in the maturities of long-term debt.
The BankUnited Facility, as amended by the Sixth Amendment, requires us to maintain the following financial covenants: (1) maintain a Fixed Cost (Debt Service) coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1.0 at December 31, 2020 and no less than 1.25 to 1.0 for the trailing four quarter period at the end of each quarter thereafter; (2) maintain a minimum net income, after taxes, of no less than $1.00; (3) effective March 31, 2021, maintain a maximum leverage ratio at the end of each quarter for the trailing four quarter period of no more than 4.0 to 1.0; (4) maintain a minimum adjusted EBITDA at the end of each quarter of no less than $1 million; and (5) maintain a minimum liquidity of $3 million at all times. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the BankUnited Facility.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $20.7 million and $26.7 million respectively outstanding under the BankUnited Facility.
BNB Bank (BNB) On April 10, 2020, we entered into the PPP Loan, with BNB Bank (now part of Dime Community Bank) as the Lender, in an aggregate principal amount of $4,795,000, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. The PPP Loan is evidenced by the Note. Subject to the terms of the Note, the PPP Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of one percent (1%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred, has an initial term of two years, and is unsecured and guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The Note provides for customary events of default including, among other things, cross-defaults on any other loan with the Lender. The PPP Loan may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
On November 2, 2020 the Company applied to the Lender for full forgiveness of the PPP Loan as calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act, as modified by the Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act. We were notified by our lender that our application was accepted and forwarded to the SBA, from whom, we are currently awaiting a response. To date the lender has not requested payment of any interest or principal. All amounts are classified as current or long term in accordance with the Note terms.
We believe that our existing resources, together with the availability under the BankUnited Facility, will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. However, our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the timing of new program awards and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our borrowing arrangement to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.
Contractual Obligations. The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years:
Inflation. Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations.
