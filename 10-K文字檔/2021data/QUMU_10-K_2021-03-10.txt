ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the section titled “Selected Financial Data” and our audited financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Software sales may take the form of a perpetual software license, a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS) or a term software license. Software licenses and appliances revenue includes sales of perpetual software licenses and hardware. Service revenue includes SaaS, term software licenses, maintenance and support, and professional and other services.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company generated revenues of $29.1 million, $25.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions. Management bases its estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The Company's actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes that of the Company's significant accounting policies, which are described in the notes to our financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment, complexity and effect on materiality. A critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, these are the policies management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Software sales may take the form of a perpetual software license, a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS) or a term software license. Software licenses and appliances revenue includes sales of perpetual software licenses and hardware. Service revenue includes SaaS, term software licenses, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Sales can range from a single year agreement for thousands of dollars to a multi-year agreement for over a million dollars.
The Company follows a five-step model to assess a sale to a customer: identify the legally binding contract, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price, and determine whether revenue will be recognized at a point in time or over time.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (i.e., performance obligations) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied either over time (for cloud-hosted software as a service, maintenance and support, and other services) or at a point in time (for software licenses and hardware).
The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of software licenses, appliances, maintenance and services, some of which are distinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation, on a relative basis using its standalone selling price.
The Company determines the standalone selling price (SSP) for software-related elements, including professional services and software maintenance and support contracts, based on the price charged for the deliverable when sold separately. The Company
estimates SSP by maximizing use of observable prices such as the prices charged to customers on a standalone basis, established prices lists, contractually stated prices, profit margins and other entity-specific factors, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. However, the selling prices of its software licenses and cloud-hosted SaaS arrangements are highly variable. Thus, the Company estimates SSP for software licenses and cloud-hosted SaaS arrangements using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other goods and services promised in the contract.
Other items relating to charges collected from customers include reimbursable expenses, shipping and handling charges and sales taxes charges. Charges collected from customers as part of the Company's sales transactions are included in revenues and the associated costs are included in cost of revenues. Sales taxes charged to and collected from customers as part of the Company’s sales transactions are excluded from revenues and recorded as a liability to the applicable governmental taxing authority.
Perpetual software licenses
The Company’s perpetual software license arrangements grant customers the right to use the software indefinitely as it exists at the time of purchase. The Company recognizes revenue for distinct software licenses once the license period has begun and the software has been made available to the customer. Payments for perpetual software license contracts are generally received upon fulfillment of the software product.
Term software licenses
The Company's term software licenses differ from perpetual software licenses in that the customer's right to use the licensed product has a termination date. Term software licenses are recognized upon transfer of control, which is typically at fulfillment, resulting in up-front revenue recognition. The Company categorizes revenue from term software licenses as subscription, maintenance and support revenue in service revenues. Payments are generally received quarterly or annually in equal or near equal installments over the term of the agreement.
Cloud-hosted software as a service
Cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS) arrangements grant customers the right to access and use the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement via third-party cloud providers. Updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement, which is generally one to three years. The Company provides an online library and technical support resources in these cloud-hosted SaaS arrangements, which in conjunction with the SaaS license constitute a single, combined performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over the term of the license. Payments are generally received annually in advance of the service period.
Hardware
The Company sells appliances that are typically drop shipped from third-party suppliers selected by the Company. The transaction price allocated to the appliance is generally recognized as revenue at fulfillment when the customer obtains control of the product. Payments for appliances are generally received upon delivery of the hardware product.
Maintenance and support
Maintenance and support arrangements grant customers the right to software updates and technical support over the term of the maintenance and support contract. Revenue from maintenance and support is generally recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is upon fulfillment of the software obligation. Payments are generally received annually in advance of the service period.
Professional services and training
Professional services and training generally consist of software implementation, on-boarding services and best practices consulting. Revenue from professional services contracts is typically recognized as performed, generally using hours expended to measure progress. Services are generally invoiced monthly for work performed.
Leases
The Company is a lessee in several non-cancellable operating leases for office space and finance leases, for certain IT equipment, that expire at various dates over the next three years. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a right of use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
For operating leases, the lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. For finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured in the same manner and at the same date as for operating leases, and is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the earlier of the useful life or the lease term.
Key estimates and judgments in accounting for leases under Topic 842 include how the Company determines (1) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value, (2) lease term and (3) lease payments. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with its short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because at the inception of the leases the Company was not reasonably certain to exercise the options, the options were not considered in determining the lease terms under Topic 842, which was adopted January 1, 2019. Many of the Company's leases include escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into its determination of lease payments under Topic 842 when reasonably certain. These options to extend or terminate a lease are at the Company's discretion. The Company has elected to take the practical expedient and not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement under Topic 842. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees.
During December 2020, the Company transitioned to permanent remote work for all of its personnel as part of its “Work from Wherever, Forever” policy. The Company notified its landlords that it was surrendering its right to occupy the office space as it closed three of its four offices due to its new remote work policy. The Company had early termination clauses for two of the three office leases which were closed. The Company notified its landlords for the two leases with these clauses that it would not be exercising its option to renew and would be exercising the leases' early termination clauses allowing the lease terms to end in May 2022 and August 2022. The impact of the reduction of the lease terms reduced the Company's operating lease liabilities by $433,000. Effective December 31, 2020, the Company will no longer occupy the leased office space in Minneapolis, Minnesota and London, England, which were primarily used for engineering, service, sales, marketing and administration, and the leased office space in Hyderabad, India, which was primarily used for software development and testing. The Company will continue to occupy its leased space in Burlingame, California, primarily for technology storage and research and development. Given the transition to permanent remote work, the Company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 a non-cash expense of approximately $637,000 related to the right of use assets-operating leases for the three surrendered office leases. Additionally, the Company incurred a non-cash expense of $280,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the surrender of certain leasehold improvements, office and computer equipment, and furniture at the leased premises.
During December 2020, the Company also entered into lease agreements associated with flexible shared workspace arrangements in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and London, England, and Hyderabad, India. The flexible shared workspace arrangement in Minneapolis, Minnesota has a lease term of 18 months and therefore is considered a lease under Topic 842. The other two flexible shared workspace arrangements are 12 months or less, and thus the Company has elected the practical expedient method and recognize the lease payments associated with its short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company intends to continue to pay all rental payments due and payable by the Company pursuant to the leases governing the leased premises.
Warrant Liability
In conjunction with the debt financings completed in October 2016 and January 2018, the Company issued two warrants for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,239,286 shares of the Company's common stock, of which one representing 314,286 shares remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to year end, a portion of the warrants were exercised in a cashless exercise. The exercise resulted in the issuance by the Company of 50,000 shares of common stock and an overall reduction of 75,703 warrant shares. On May 1, 2020, the Company canceled the ESW warrant in exchange for a note payable (see Note 4-"Commitments and Contingencies" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) which contained an embedded derivative liability that is measured on a recurring basis at fair value. On August 31, 2018, the Company issued a separate warrant to a sales partner for the purchase of up to 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The Company accounts for the warrants, which are derivative financial instruments, as a current liability based upon the characteristics and provisions of the instruments. The warrants were determined to be ineligible for equity classification because of provisions that allow the holder under certain circumstances, essentially the sale of the Company as defined in the warrant agreements, to receive cash payment or other consideration at the option of the holder in lieu of the Company's common shares.
A warrant liability is recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at its fair value on the date of issuance and is revalued on each subsequent balance sheet date until such instrument is exercised or expires, with any changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded as other income or expense. The Company estimates the fair value of this liability using option pricing models that are based on the individual characteristics of the warrants on the valuation date, which include the Company’s stock price and assumptions for expected volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate, as well as the present value of the minimum cash payment component of the instrument for the warrants, when applicable. Changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the resulting fair value of each warrant. The primary inputs affecting the value of the warrant liability are the Company’s stock price and volatility in the Company's stock price, as well as assumptions about the probability and timing of certain events, such as a change in control or future equity offerings. Increases in the fair value of the underlying stock or increases in the volatility of the stock price generally result in a corresponding increase in the fair value of the warrant liability; conversely, decreases in the fair value of the underlying stock or decreases in the volatility of the stock price generally result in a corresponding decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability.
Results of Operations
The percentage relationships to revenues of certain income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and the percentage changes in these income and expense items between years, are contained in the following table:
Revenues
The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Software sales may take the form of a perpetual software license, a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS) or a term software license. Software licenses and appliances revenue includes sales of perpetual software licenses and hardware. Service revenue includes SaaS, term software licenses, maintenance and support, and professional and other services.
The table below describes Qumu's revenues by product category (dollars in thousands):
Revenues can vary year to year based on the type of contract the Company enters into with each customer. The $3.7 million, or 15%, increase in total revenues from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by revenue attributable to a large customer order received at the end of the first quarter 2020, which the customer identified as specifically driven by the change in working environment due to COVID-19, resulting in increases in both software licenses and appliances revenues and service revenues.
The $1.9 million increase in service revenues from 2019 to 2020 primarily resulted from a $1.3 million increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues due to the aforementioned large customer order received in 2020, partially offset by the recognition of large term license sales in 2019 that were absent in the comparable period of 2020. Also contributing to the increase in service revenues was a $545,000, or 25%, increase in professional services revenues, which benefited from large software and appliances sales during 2020.
The $349,000 increase in total revenues from 2018 to 2019 reflects a $1.3 million increase in service revenues and a $911,000 decrease in software licenses and appliances revenues. The $1.3 million increase in service revenues from 2018 to 2019 resulted from a $1.1 million increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues and a $143,000 increase in professional services revenues. The decrease in software licenses and appliances revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by a decrease in perpetual software license and appliance sales to both new and existing customers. The increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 primary resulted from significant first quarter 2019 term software license sales for which revenue is recognized up front, as well as the revenue attributable to new subscription, maintenance and support agreements from new and existing customers.
Future consolidated revenues will be dependent upon many factors, including the rate of adoption of the Company's software solutions in its targeted markets and whether arrangements with customers are structured as a perpetual, term or SaaS licenses, which impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Other factors that will influence future consolidated revenues include the timing of customer orders and renewals, the product and service mix of customer orders, the impact of changes in economic conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
A comparison of gross profit and gross margin by revenue category is as follows (dollars in thousands):
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, gross margins are inclusive of the impact of approximately $286,000, $455,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, in amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2011 and Kulu Valley in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company had 21, 19 and 18 service personnel at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross margin percentages decreased in total in 2020 as compared to 2019. The 0.9% decrease in gross margin in 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily driven by a 0.9% decrease in service gross margin in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower term license revenue, which generally carries higher margins. Additionally, 2020 included outsourced professional services expenses for certain customer-specific projects, which negatively impacted services gross margin.
The 6.2% improvement in gross margin in 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily driven by a 7.2% improvement in service gross margin due to an increase in term software license revenue, decreased amortization expense as certain purchased intangible assets became fully amortized during 2018, and lower royalty expense associated with third-party software licenses.
Future gross profit margins will fluctuate quarter to quarter and will be impacted by the Company's continued expansion into new market opportunities, as well as, the rate of growth and mix of the Company's product and service offerings and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Cost of software licenses and appliances revenues in 2021 is expected to include approximately $0.1 million of amortization expense for purchased intangibles.
Operating Expenses
The following is a summary of operating expenses (dollars in thousands):
Operating expenses increased 19% for 2020 compared to 2019 and represented 96.4%, 93.1%, and 93.6% of revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating expenses for 2020 increased from 2019 by $4.4 million, primarily driven by approximately $1.6 million in one-time transaction expense associated with the Company’s now terminated merger with Synacor, Inc. and approximately $917,000 in one-time non-cash office lease charges resulting from adoption of the Company’s remote work policy in the fourth quarter 2020. The Company incurred severance expense of $647,000 , $152,000 and $237,000 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, relating to cost reduction initiatives and personnel transitions and, in 2020, the departure of the Company's chief executive officer.
Research and development
Research and development expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
Total research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 represented 28%, 29% and 28% of revenues, respectively. The Company had 36, 36 and 34 research and development personnel at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The $892,000 increase in total expenses in 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily due to increased costs related to the mix of research and development personnel, incentive compensation costs and projects to support customers’ increased usage of Qumu’s cloud-based enterprise video solution due to COVID-19. The $347,000 increase in total expenses in 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to transition costs related to the Company's in-process migration and consolidation of cloud hosting providers during 2019, impacting outside services and consulting expenses, as well as overhead and other expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2019 and 2018 as certain fixed assets became fully depreciated.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
Total sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 represented 31%, 34% and 34% of revenues, respectively. The Company had 28, 32 and 27 sales and marketing personnel at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The $346,000 increase in total sales and marketing expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily driven by increased costs for outside services and consulting associated with the implementation of the Company's strategic plan in 2020, higher compensation costs associated with changes in sales and marketing personnel, and increased commissions expense, partially offset by cost savings resulting from sales activities and customer marketing events that were conducted virtually rather than in person. The $315,000 increase in total sales and marketing expense in 2019 as compared to 2018 was driven primarily driven by increased compensation and employee-related costs due to higher commissions expense and the mix and number of sales and marketing personnel, partially offset by a decrease in overhead and other expenses impacted by continued cost reduction initiatives. Sales and marketing expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 included severance expense of $145,000, $152,000 and $111,000, respectively, relating to cost reduction initiatives and personnel transitions.
General and administrative
General and administrative expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
Total general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 represented 35%, 27% and 29% of revenues, respectively. The Company had 17, 18 and 18 general and administrative personnel at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The $3.3 million increase in total expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven primarily by transaction-related expenses related to the Company's merger agreement and subsequent merger termination with Synacor, Inc. totaling $1.6 million in 2020, $917,000 in non-cash charges resulting from the adoption of the Company’s remote work policy in the fourth quarter 2020, and $0.4 million of severance costs incurred with the departure of the Company's chief executive officer in 2020. The $335,000 decrease in total expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018 was driven primarily by lower outside services costs resulting from decreased legal expenses, a reduction in audit fees and lower contractor costs.
Amortization of Purchased Intangibles
Operating expenses include $657,000, $757,000 and $904,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in October 2011 and Kulu Valley in October
2014. Operating expenses in 2021 are expected to include approximately $0.7 million of amortization expense associated with purchased intangibles, exclusive of the portion classified in cost of revenue.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was as follows (dollars in thousands):
Interest expense, net
The Company recognized interest expense, net, of $73,000, $754,000 and $1.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to its note payable, term loans and capital leases, including the amortization of deferred financing costs. The decrease in interest expense in 2020 and 2019, compared to the respective prior years, was primarily due to a decrease in term loan debt resulting from the Company's $6.0 million principal balance repayment in July 2018 on the $10.0 million credit agreement with ESW Holdings, Inc., and the Company's $4.0 million remaining principal balance payment on November 12, 2019.
Change in fair values of derivative liability and warrant liability
In conjunction with the debt financings completed in October 2016 and January 2018, the Company issued two transferable warrants for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,239,286 shares of the Company's common stock, of which one representing 314,286 shares remained unexercised and outstanding at December 31, 2020. On May 1, 2020, the Company canceled the ESW warrant in exchange for a note payable (see Note 4-"Commitments and Contingencies" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) which contained an embedded derivative liability that is measured on a recurring basis at fair value. The Company recorded non-cash income of $103,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative liability. Additionally, on August 31, 2018, the Company issued a transferable warrant to a sales partner, iStudy Co., Ltd., (iStudy warrant) for the purchase of up to 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
During 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded non-cash expense of $1.8 million and $141,000, respectively, and during 2018 the Company recorded non-cash income of $368,000, resulting from the change in fair value of the warrant liability. See Note 4-"Commitments and Contingencies" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of inputs impacting changes in fair value. The non-cash expense of $1.8 million in 2020 primarily resulted from an increase in the Company's stock price to $7.99 per share at December 31, 2020 from $2.61 per share at December 31, 2019.
Gain on sale of BriefCam, Ltd.
During 2018, Canon Inc. ("Canon") acquired all of the outstanding shares of BriefCam, Ltd. ("BriefCam"), a privately-held Israeli company, and the Company received $9.7 million from the closing proceeds for its convertible preferred shares of BriefCam, as well as received $100,000 following the satisfaction of a contingency, resulting in a gain on sale of $6.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $41,000 related to the release of cash from escrow in connection with the sale.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
On July 19, 2018, the Company paid $6.5 million on its outstanding term loan from ESW Holdings, Inc. under its term loan credit agreement dated January 12, 2018. The payment was comprised of principal of $6.0 million and accrued interest of $463,000 for the period January 12, 2018 to the payment date of July 19, 2018. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of its investment in BriefCam to fund the prepayment. The Company determined that the prepayment of principal constituted a partial extinguishment of debt and, as such, recognized a $1.2 million loss related to the write down of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs in 2018.
On November 12, 2019, the Company paid the remaining $4.8 million due on its outstanding term loan from ESW Holdings, Inc. The payment was comprised of principal of $4.0 million and accrued interest of $528,000 for the period July 19, 2018 to the payment date of November 12, 2019. The Company used a portion of the $8.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock on November 7, 2019 to fund the payment. The Company determined that the payment of principal constituted an extinguishment of debt and, as such, recognized a $348,000 loss related to the write down of $98,000 of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs and recognition of a $250,000 prepayment fee upon payment of the remaining term loan balance.
Other expense, net
The Company determined that it had excess capacity at its Minneapolis, Minnesota headquarters and effective May 1, 2018 ceased using a portion of its leased space, subsequently making it available for occupancy by a sublessee. The Company also recorded a loss related to the exit activity of $177,000 (net of adjustments for the derecognition of leasehold improvement and deferred rent balances related to the exit activity), which is included in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other expense, net, includes sublease income from the Company's subleases of $105,000 and $160,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. No sublease income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other expense, net, also includes net losses on foreign currency transactions of $406,000, $260,000 and $55,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for a discussion of changes in cash levels.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes represents federal, state, and foreign income taxes or income tax benefit on income or loss. Net income tax benefit was $306,000 and $194,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and net income tax expense was $298,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted, significantly altering U.S. corporate income tax law. Many of the new elements of the Tax Act became effective during 2018, including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, limitations on executive compensation, as well as international provisions. The Company has considered and incorporated the new provisions into its tax calculations. Such provisions included in the Tax Act did not significantly impact the Company in 2020 and 2019, due to the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. For further discussion of the Tax Act and its impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, see Note 11-"Income Taxes" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The net income tax benefit for 2020 and 2019 was impacted by the tax benefit for refundable research credits from the United Kingdom operations. The net income tax expense for 2018 was impacted by an increase in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a tax benefit for refundable research credits from United Kingdom operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Company's liquidity and capital resources (in thousands):
The Company expects it will be able to maintain current operations and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months through any cash flows generated from current operations, cash reserves, and additional resources including the approximately $23.1 million in net proceeds from the Company's issuance of common stock and $10.0 million revolving credit facility both of which closed in January 2021. See Note 15-"Subsequent Events" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had aggregate negative working capital of $2.9 million, compared to positive working capital of $829,000 at December 31, 2019. Working capital includes current deferred revenue of $12.9 million and $10.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in working capital as of December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, is primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.

The Company's primary source of cash from operating activities has been cash collections from sales of products and services to customers. The Company expects cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases or decreases in sales and timing of collections. The Company's primary use of cash for operating activities has been for personnel costs and outside service providers, payment of royalties associated with third-party software licenses and purchases of equipment to fulfill customer orders. The Company expects cash flows from operating activities to be affected by fluctuations in revenues, personnel costs, outside service providers, and the amount and timing of royalty payments and equipment purchases as the Company continues to support the growth of the business. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's international subsidiaries that is not available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated was $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020.
