Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing differentiated therapies for patients with liver and gastrointestinal, or GI, diseases. Our most advanced program targets the farnesoid X receptor, or FXR, which is central to modulating liver and GI diseases. FXR agonism has been investigated in large-scale clinical trials and has shown clinically relevant improvements in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a liver disease characterized by excess liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis. We believe that potency, sustained exposure and continuous target engagement are key to optimizing therapeutic benefit with an FXR targeted therapy. Leveraging our extensive chemistry and biology expertise, we have built a proprietary library of over 2,500 FXR compounds, and have selected two novel, oral FXR candidates from a unique chemical scaffold, MET409 and MET642, that have the potential to deliver improved tolerability and therapeutic outcomes. MET409 and MET642 were purposefully designed to be differentiated treatments for NASH as potent, sustained FXR agonists, with the ability to be dosed orally once daily. With our program, we believe we can develop differentiated FXR agonist therapies for NASH and other GI diseases. For additional information about our business and our product candidate development programs, see the discussion contained within “Item 1. Business” in this Annual Report.
To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business, planning, raising capital, researching, discovering and developing our pipeline in FXR and other drug targets and general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the private placement of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of long-term debt, and the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO. To date, we have raised gross proceeds of approximately $124.8 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $10.0 million under our loan agreement with K2 HealthVentures, LLC, or K2, and $85.0 million from our IPO in September 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $96.2 million.
We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses were $37.3 million and $28.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $120.7 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and preclinical studies and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially as product candidates from our FXR program and any future product candidates advance through preclinical studies and clinical trials, and as we expand our clinical, regulatory, quality and manufacturing capabilities, incur significant commercialization expenses for marketing, sales, manufacturing and distribution, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more product candidates, which will not be for many years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, additional borrowings under our loan agreement, collaborations, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenues
To date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of any products, and we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of any products for the foreseeable future, if ever.
Research and Development Expenses
To date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.
Research and development expenses include:
•
salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts;
•
external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites and consultants to conduct our preclinical, toxicology and clinical studies;
•
costs related to manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and preclinical studies, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers;
•
laboratory supplies;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, insurance, equipment and other supplies.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses allocated by program for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of our internal personnel related costs, facility costs, and lab supplies.
We plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our FXR program and discovery of new product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate’s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.
Our development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number and scope of preclinical studies;
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the phase of development of the product candidate; and
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility-related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, investor relations, and insurance. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our expanded research and development activities and infrastructure and, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums, board of director fees, and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company.
Total Other Income (Expense)
Total other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, interest expense under our loan agreement and changes in the fair value of our warrant liability.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $26.8 million and $26.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses of $0.8 million when comparing the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to increases in toxicology and clinical trial expenses of $2.7 million related to our FXR program and $1.1 million in personnel costs, which included $0.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by decreases in preclinical expenses of $1.7 million, manufacturing expenses of $1.0 million, and consulting and professional services expense of $0.3 million.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $9.9 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $5.9 million when comparing the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $4.0 million, including $2.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, and consulting, professional services, and other public company related expenses of $1.7 million.
Total Other Income (Expense). Total other income (expense) was $(0.6) million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in total other income (expense) of $1.7 million when comparing the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was due primarily to a decrease of $0.9 million in interest income resulting from lower average investment balances and yields during 2020 and an increase in interest expense of $0.7 million related to borrowings under our August 2019 loan agreement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $96.2 million.
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated:
Operating Activities
The net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to our net loss of $37.3 million, adjusted for $6.4 million of noncash charges, and $5.3 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Noncash charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $5.0 million, amortization of our right-of-use asset of $0.6 million, depreciation expense of $0.3 million, and non-cash interest expense of $0.3 million.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to our net loss of $28.9 million, adjusted for $2.2 million of noncash charges, and $1.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Noncash charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million, amortization of our right-of-use asset of $0.6 million, depreciation expense of $0.3 million, partially offset by accretion of discounts on investments of $0.6 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to purchases of short-term investments of $79.9 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.2 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments of $48.0 million.
Net cash provided by investing activities of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due primarily to sales and maturities of short-term investments of $70.8 million, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $53.0 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.1 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our initial public offering of $76.9 million and stock option exercises of $0.2 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due primarily to net proceeds from borrowings from our long-term debt facility.
Initial Public Offering
On September 18, 2020, we closed our IPO of 6,540,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share. We raised $76.9 million in net proceeds from the IPO after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions of $6.0 million and issuance costs of $2.2 million.
Loan Agreement
We borrowed $10.0 million in the first tranche under our loan agreement with K2 in August 2019, as amended in March 2020. The remaining borrowings available under the Loan and Security Agreement have expired.
The term loan bears interest at a floating annual rate equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate used by lender plus 2.0% and (ii) 7.25%. The monthly payments are interest-only until September 1, 2022. Subsequent to the interest-only period, the term loan will be payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, through September 1, 2023, the term loan maturity date. In addition, we are obligated to pay a final payment fee of 5.25% of the original principal amount of the term loan at the maturity date. We may elect to prepay all, but not less than all, of the term loan prior to the maturity date, subject to a prepayment fee of up to 3.0% of the then outstanding principal balance. After repayment, no term loan amounts may be borrowed again.
Our obligations under the loan agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property. The loan agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and also includes standard events of default, including an event of default based on the occurrence of a material adverse event, and a default under any agreement with a third party resulting in a right of such third party to accelerate the maturity of any debt in excess of $0.3 million. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on us transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying cash dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and making any payment on subordinated debt, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the lender may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the loan agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the loan agreement.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, we had the following contractual obligations (in thousands):
(1) The lease agreement for our corporate headquarters contains fixed payment terms based upon the passage of time. Our lease agreement requires payment of maintenance and real estate taxes.
(2) Our contractual obligation under our Loan and Security Agreement consists of principal payments, interest, and fees due to K2.
Under a license agreement with The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, or the FXR License Agreement, we have payment obligations that are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and are required to make development milestone payments and royalty payments in connection with sublicensing revenue and the sale of products developed under that agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones or making future product sales and, therefore, any related payments are not included in the table above. For additional information regarding the FXR License Agreement, including our payment obligations thereunder, see “FXR License Agreement” in Item 1. “Business” and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on 10-K.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical trial sites and clinical supply manufacturers and with vendors for preclinical studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts and not included in the table above.
Funding Requirements
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. In particular, we expect our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, will allow us to fund our ongoing MET409 Phase 2a combination clinical trial in NASH through completion, fund our ongoing MET642 Phase 2a monotherapy clinical trial in NASH through completion, fund a Phase 2a monotherapy clinical trial of either MET409 or MET642 in UC through initial partial enrollment, and fund a Phase 2b monotherapy clinical trial of either MET409 or MET642 in NASH through initial partial enrollment. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could expend our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, rate of progress and costs of our drug discovery, preclinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the scope and costs of manufacturing our product candidates and commercial manufacturing activities;
•
the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;
•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of our product candidates;
•
the costs associated with being a public company;
•
the timing of any milestone and royalty payments to The Salk, or other future licensors;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and
•
the cost associated with commercializing our product candidates, if they receive marketing approval.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the pandemic. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued Expenses
We make estimates of our accrued research and development expenses for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost.
We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of equity awards recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. We estimate the fair value of all stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize forfeitures as they occur. Estimating the fair value of equity awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables, including the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of stock options, and the expected dividend yield. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relating to stock options was $14.4 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years.
Common stock valuations
Prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock had been determined by our board of directors as of the date of each award grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the grant date.
After the closing of our IPO in September 2020, we began utilizing the closing stock price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market as both the exercise price and an input to the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine stock-based compensation expense.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
