ITEM 7MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.
We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including SDB, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based digital health applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers.
Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and other respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns.
We are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During fiscal year 2021, we invested $225.3 million on research and development activities, which represents 7.0% of net revenues with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. During fiscal year 2021 we commenced a controlled product launch of AirSense 11, which will be followed by a broader launch throughout fiscal year 2022. AirSense 11 will introduce new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy and digital enhancements, such as over-the-air update capabilities. Due to multiple acquisitions, including Brightree in April 2016, HEALTHCAREfirst in July 2018 and MatrixCare in November 2018, our operations now include out-of-hospital software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our SaaS business. These products, our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”).
Net revenue in fiscal year 2021 increased to $3,196.8 million, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal year 2020. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2021 to $1,839.1 million, from $1,717.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase $121.3 million or 7%. Our net income for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $474.5 million or $3.24 per diluted share compared to net income of $621.7 million or $4.27 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2020. Unrecognized tax benefits as described at note 14 - Income Taxes impacted our diluted earnings per share by $1.70 for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2021 was $736.7 million and at June 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $295.3 million. At June 30, 2021, our total assets were $4.7 billion and our stockholders’ equity was $2.9 billion. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share during fiscal 2021 with a total amount of $226.7 million paid to stockholders.
In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis”, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to fiscal year June 30, 2019, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report for the Year Ended June 30, 2020, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2020.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic. Our primary goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is the preservation of life. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our employees and continuing to use our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the challenges the pandemic poses.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we observed immaterial incremental demand for our ventilator devices and masks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there is still substantial uncertainty, we believe the global demand for ventilators and other respiratory support devices used to treat COVID-19 patients has largely been met. As such, we do not expect material COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilator products for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022.
Diagnostic pathways for sleep apnea treatment, including physician practices, HME suppliers and sleep clinics, have been impacted and, in some instances, been required, to temporarily close due to governments’ “shelter-in-place” orders, quarantines or similar orders or restrictions enacted to control the spread of COVID-19. In some countries, new patients are prescribed sleep apnea treatment through hospitals that are directing their resources to critical care, including COVID-19 treatment. The impact on these diagnostic and prescription pathways has resulted in a decrease in demand from new patients for our products designed to treat sleep apnea. Although certain governments have begun to reduce or remove COVID-19 restrictions and implement vaccination programs to varying degrees, we are uncertain as to the duration and extent of the impact on demand for our sleep devices. However, due to the nature of the installed base of existing patients using our devices, we have not seen any significant adverse impact on demand for re-supply of our masks.
Our SaaS business has also been affected by COVID-19 and measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19. Some of our existing and potential SaaS customers are HME distributors and have been impacted by the same temporary business closures noted above. We also have existing and potential SaaS customers that operate care facilities and are either receiving and treating patients infected with COVID-19 or have implemented significant measures to safeguard their facilities against a potential COVID-19 outbreak. Given these challenging business conditions, businesses may be deterred from adopting new or changing SaaS platforms, which may adversely impact our ability to engage new customers for our SaaS businesses, or expand the services used by existing customers.
Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees. We have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide, but since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, we were able to broadly maintain our operations, and we are beginning the slow and careful process of progressively returning to work in some of our offices around the world. The pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity position.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020
Net Revenues. Net revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased to $3,196.8 million from $2,957.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $239.8 million or 8% (a 6% increase on a constant currency basis). The following table summarizes our net revenue disaggregated by segment, product and region for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 (in thousands):
*Constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements in international currencies.
Sleep and Respiratory Care
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased to $2,823.2 million from $2,602.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $220.9 million or 8%. Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar positively impacted net revenues by approximately $75.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. Excluding the impact of currency movements, total net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased by 6% compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic and increased demand following a recent product recall by one of our competitors, partially offset by decreased COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators.
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in the United States, Canada and Latin America for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased to $1,705.1 million from $1,572.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $132.8 million or 8%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic and increased demand following a recent product recall by one of our competitors, partially offset by decreased COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators.
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased for the year ended June 30, 2021 to $1,118.1 million from $1,030.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $88.1 million or 9% (an increase of 2% on a constant currency basis). The constant currency increase in sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic, partially offset by decreased COVID-19-related demand for our ventilators.
Net revenue from devices for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased to $1,610.0 million from $1,507.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $102.2 million or 7%, including an increase of 9% in the United States, Canada and Latin America and an increase of 4% in combined Europe, Asia and other markets (a 2% decrease on a constant currency basis). Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased by 3%.
Net revenue from masks and other for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased to $1,213.2 million from $1,094.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 11%, including an increase of 8% in the United States, Canada and Latin America and an increase of 18% in combined Europe, Asia and other markets (an 11% increase on a constant currency basis). Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, masks and other sales increased by 9%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2020.

Software as a Service
Net revenue from our SaaS business for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $373.6 million, compared to $354.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $19.0 million or 5%. The increase was predominantly due to continued growth in resupply service offerings.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2021 to $1,839.1 million from $1,717.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $121.3 million or 7%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 57.5% for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared with the 58.1% for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to product mix changes, declines in average selling prices and geographic mix changes, partially offset by lower amortization of acquired intangibles.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended June 30, 2021 to $670.4 million from $676.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $6.3 million or 1%. The selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in U.S. dollars, were unfavorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which increased our expenses by approximately $22.4 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 decreased by 4% compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 improved to 21.0% compared to 22.9% for the year ended June 30, 2020. The constant currency decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in travel and entertainment and bad debt expenses, partially offset by increases in employee-related expenses.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2021 to $225.3 million from $201.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $23.3 million or 12%. The research and development expenses were unfavorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which increased our expenses by approximately $8.1 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased by 8% compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.0% for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to 6.8% for the year ended June 30, 2020. The constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased investment in our digital health technologies and SaaS solutions.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2021 totaled $31.1 million compared to $30.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Restructuring Expenses. In November 2020, we closed our POC business, which was part of the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized restructuring expenses of $13.9 million primarily related to inventory write-downs of $5.2 million, accelerated amortization of acquired intangible assets of $5.1 million, asset impairments of $2.3 million, employee-related costs of $0.7 million and contract cancellation costs of $0.6 million. Of the total expense recognized during the year ended June 30, 2021, the inventory write-down of $5.2 million is presented within cost of sales and the remaining $8.7 million in restructuring costs is separately disclosed as restructuring expenses on the consolidated statements of income. We do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future.
Total Other Income (Loss), Net. Total other income (loss), net for the year ended June 30, 2021 was a loss of $20.0 million, compared to a loss of $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was partially due to a decrease in interest expense to $24.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $40.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. Additionally, we recognized an unrealized gain of $14.5 million on our marketable and non-marketable securities for the year ended June 30, 2021, whereas during the year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded an impairment of $14.5 million on our non-marketable equity securities. We also recorded lower losses attributable to equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2021 of $11.2 million compared to $25.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate increased to 46.3% for the year ended June 30, 2021 from 15.2% for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily the result of an increase in unrecognized tax benefits as outlined below. Excluding the impact of the unrecognized tax benefit, our effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2021 was 18.2%. The increase in our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the unrecognized tax benefit, was due to the geographic mix of earnings and lower windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards, which reduced our income tax expense by $12.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $24.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.

We are under audit by the Australian Taxation Office (the “ATO”) for the years 2009 to 2018 (the “Audit Period”). The audits primarily involve a transfer pricing dispute in which the ATO asserts we should have paid additional Australian taxes on income derived from our Singapore operations. The ATO issued Notices of Amended Assessments for the tax years 2009 to 2013 seeking a total of $266.0 million, consisting of $151.7 million in additional income tax and $114.3 million in penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 periods are still under audit and we have not yet received any Notices of Amended Assessments relative to those periods. A total of $98.8 million in tax has been prepaid in relation to the Audit Period, which is consistent with ATO procedural audit practice.
We are engaged in advanced discussions with the ATO to settle the dispute for the entire Audit Period. Given the stage of those discussions, during the year ended June 30, 2021, we recorded $395.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including $47.5 million of accrued interest and penalties. This translates to a net amount of $248.7 million of net unrecognized tax benefits after taking into account tax credits and deductions of $146.6 million.
If the matter were to progress to litigation, we continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position. If we are not successful in litigation, we will be required to pay some or all of the additional income tax, accrued interest and penalties, including potential additional amounts relating to the 2014 to 2018 periods.
Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. Also, as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, effective as of the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, if any, will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax.
Net Income and Earnings per Share. As a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $474.5 million compared to net income of $621.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. Our earnings per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $3.24 compared to $4.27 for the year ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of 24%. Unrecognized tax benefits as described at note 14 - Income Taxes reduced our diluted earnings per share for the year ended June 30, 2021 by $1.70 per share.
Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The measure “non-GAAP revenue” is equal to GAAP net revenue once adjusted for deferred revenue fair value adjustments applied in the purchase accounting for previous business combinations. The measure “non-GAAP cost of sales” is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and restructuring expense associated with inventory write-downs following the closure of the POC business. The measure “non-GAAP gross profit” is the difference between non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and “non-GAAP gross margin” is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to non-GAAP revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $295.3 million and $463.2 million, respectively. Working capital was $663.0 million and $920.7 million, at June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. As of June 30, 2021 we had $0.7 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, term credit facility and senior notes as compared to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, we had $1.6 billion available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of $1.9 billion in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility. We believe that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond.
As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the United States amounted to $106.7 million and $158.8 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, of $188.6 million and $304.4 million, respectively, were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
We repatriated $560.1 million and $400.0 million to the United States during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the United States in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2022 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the United States, such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations.
As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings prior to 2018 as taxable. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 14 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).
Inventories at June 30, 2021 were $457.0 million, an increase of $40.1 or 10% over the balance at June 30, 2020 of $416.9 million. The increase in inventories was required to respond to the increase in unit volumes and the additional complexity and elongation of our supply chain resulting from ongoing COVID-19 impacts.
Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at June 30, 2021 were $614.3 million, an increase of $139.6 million or 29% over the June 30, 2020 accounts receivable balance of $474.6 million. Accounts receivable days’ sales outstanding of 68 days at June 30, 2021 increased by 3 days compared to 65 days at June 30, 2020. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at June 30, 2021 and 2020 was 5.0% and 5.7%, respectively.
We recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases except those that meet the definition of a short-term lease. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020 our right-of-use assets were $128.6 million and $118.3 million, respectively and our lease liabilities were $138.4 million and $123.1 million, respectively.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we generated cash of $736.7 million from operations compared to $802.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in cash generated from operations during the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to the increase in working capital balances and income tax payments. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended June 30, 2021 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $18.5 million, as reported in U.S. dollars.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we paid $43.5 million associated with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, compared to $27.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2020.
We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to acquisitions, and more recently, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. In addition, during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we paid to holders of our common stock dividends totaling $226.7 million and $225.1 million, respectively.

Credit Facility
On April 17, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, or the Revolving Credit Agreement, as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, joint book runner, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner. The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $800.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million.
Additionally, on April 17, 2018, ResMed Limited entered into a syndicated facility agreement, or the Term Credit Agreement, as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, and Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner. The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million.
On November 5, 2018, we entered into a first amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the size of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility from $800.0 million to $1.6 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million.
Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, and ResMed Limited’s obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement contain customary covenants, including, in each case, a financial covenant that requires that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, as applicable). The entire principal amounts of the revolving credit facility and term credit facility, and, in each case, any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable. Events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement include, in each case, failure to make payments when due, the occurrence of a default in the performance of any covenants in the respective agreements or related documents, or certain changes of control of us, or the respective guarantors of the obligations borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on April 17, 2023, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. Amounts borrowed under the Term Credit Agreement will also amortize on a semi-annual basis, with a $6.0 million principal payment required on each such semi-annual amortization date. The outstanding principal amounts will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.75% to 1.50% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) or the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable) plus 0.0% to 0.50% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At June 30, 2021, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amounts was 0.9%. An applicable commitment fee of 0.100% to 0.175% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. At June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $158.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement.
Senior Notes
On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July 10, 2029. Our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, including ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc., Birdie Inc., Inova Labs, Inc., Brightree LLC, Brightree Home Health & Hospice LLC, Brightree Patient Collections LLC, ResMed Operations Inc., HEALTHCAREfirst Holding Company, HCF Holdco Company, HEALTHCAREfirst, Inc., CareFacts Information Systems, LLC and Lewis Computer Services, LLC, MatrixCare Holdings Inc., MatrixCare, Inc., Reciprocal Labs Corporation and ResMed SaaS Inc., under a Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement dated as of July 10, 2019. The net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement.
Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to customary covenants including with respect to our corporate existence, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and other extraordinary transactions. We also agreed that, subject to limited exceptions, we will maintain a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and will not at any time permit the amount of all secured and unsecured debt of us and our subsidiaries to exceed 10% of our consolidated tangible assets, determined as of the end of our most recently ended fiscal quarter. This ratio is calculated at the end of each reporting period for which the Note Purchase Agreement requires us to deliver financial statements, using the results of the 12 consecutive month period ending with such reporting period.
On June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was a total of $658.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and undrawn debt facilities.
Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.
We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
PART II
Item 7
RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(1) Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets. We make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. Our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value, and for goodwill is limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit, as described in Step 1 below. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
We conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps:
Step 0 or Qualitative assessment - Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.
Step 1 - Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.
(2) Income Tax. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. These changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.
Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on our regular assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
We are under audit by the Australian Taxation Office (the “ATO”) for the years 2009 to 2018 (the “Audit Period”). The audits primarily involve a transfer pricing dispute in which the ATO asserts we should have paid additional Australian taxes on income derived from our Singapore operations. The ATO issued Notices of Amended Assessments for the tax years 2009 to 2013 seeking a total of $266.0 million, consisting of $151.7 million in additional income tax and $114.3 million in penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 periods are still under audit and we have not yet received any Notices of Amended Assessments relative to those periods. A total of $98.8 million in tax has been prepaid in relation to the Audit Period, which is consistent with ATO procedural audit practice.
We are engaged in advanced discussions with the ATO to settle the dispute for the entire Audit Period. Given the stage of those discussions, during the year ended June 30, 2021, we recorded $395.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including $47.5 million of accrued interest and penalties. This amount reflects our estimate of the potential tax liability and is subject to change.
Included in the balance of uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2021 were $248.7 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount represents the $395.3 million of gross unrecognized tax, adjusted for tax credits and deductions of $146.6 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
If the matter were to progress to litigation, we continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position. If we are not successful in litigation, we will be required to pay some or all of the additional income tax, accrued interest and penalties, including potential additional amounts relating to the 2014 to 2018 periods.
The timing and resolution of the ATO audits are inherently uncertain, and the amounts we might ultimately pay or receive in credits and deductions, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the ATO may differ materially from the amounts accrued. Although it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change in the next 12 months, an estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made.
Outside the ATO audit describe above, tax years 2017 to 2020 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.
(3) Revenue Recognition. We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”). For products in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our SaaS business, revenue associated with professional services are recognized as they are provided. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our SaaS business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some SaaS contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g., rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns offered to customers. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. We also recognize discount on products as a reduction to revenue when control is transferred. We adjust the estimate of revenue for the impact of returned items at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed. However, returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, are infrequent and insignificant.
When Sleep and Respiratory Care or SaaS contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each performance obligation. An allocation is not required for many of our Sleep and Respiratory Care contracts that have a single performance obligation, which is the shipment of our therapy-based equipment.
