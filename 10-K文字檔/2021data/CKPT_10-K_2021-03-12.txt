Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in the following discussion and throughout this report that are not historical in nature are “forward-looking statements.” You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “intend,” “believe,” and similar expressions. Although we believe the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are inherently subject to risk and we can give no assurances that our expectations will prove to be correct. Actual results could differ from those described in this report because of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A “Risk Factors.” We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect actual outcomes. Please see “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Form 10-K.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Overview
We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers. We are evaluating our lead antibody product candidate, cosibelimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber, in an ongoing global, open-label, multicohort Phase 1 clinical trial in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, including ongoing cohorts in locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma intended to support one or more applications for marketing approval. In addition, we are evaluating our lead small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agent, CK-101, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor, as a potential new treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
We have also entered into various collaboration agreements with TGTX, a related party, to develop and commercialize certain assets in connection with our licenses in the field of hematological malignancies, while we retain the right to develop and commercialize these assets in solid tumors.
In September 2020, we announced updated interim results from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of cosibelimab. The data were presented in a poster presentation at the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020. We continue to enroll CSCC patients to support one or more BLA submissions to the FDA for cosibelimab based on this ongoing clinical trial. The primary endpoint is ORR, and secondary endpoints include duration of response, PFS, and overall survival.
In November 2020, updated results from the previously untreated high PD-L1 expressing patients with advanced NSCLC cohort of the Phase 1 clinical trial of cosibelimab were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 35th Anniversary Annual Meeting.
To date, we have not received approval for the sale of any product candidate in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from any product candidates. In addition, we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2020, we have an accumulated deficit of $143.2 million.
We are a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress.
Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on November 10, 2014 and commenced principal operations in March 2015. Our executive offices are located at 2 Gansevoort Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10014. Our telephone number is (781) 652-4500 and our email address is ir@checkpointtx.com.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue was approximately $1.1 million compared to approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of approximately $0.6 million. Revenue for the current period primarily consisted of $1.0 million from TGTX related to the collaboration agreement, including a milestone of $925,000 upon the 12th patient dosed in a phase 1 clinical trial for cosibelimab during March 2020. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $1.6 million from TGTX related to the collaboration agreement, including a $1.0 million upfront licensing fee due upon the signing of an amendment to the agreement and approximately $0.6 million for the purchase of clinical material of cosibelimab.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third party CROs for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings and patents, laboratory costs and other supplies.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expenses were approximately $16.4 million, compared to approximately $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.9 million. The current period research and development expenses primarily consisted of $8.0 million related to clinical costs for our product candidates, $4.6 million related to the non-cash annual equity fee in connection with the Founders’ Agreement, $1.7 million related to the manufacturing costs of our product candidates, and $0.6 million related to stock compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2019, research and development expenses primarily consisted of $9.1 million related to clinical costs for our product candidates, $5.4 million related to manufacturing and related costs of our product candidates, $2.5 million related to the non-cash annual equity fee in connection with the Founders’ Agreement and $0.7 million related to stock compensation expense.
We anticipate research and development expenses in 2021 to increase as compared to 2020.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for executives and other administrative personnel, recruitment expenses, professional fees and other corporate expenses, including investor relations, legal activities, and facilities-related expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses were approximately $7.9 million, compared to approximately $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $0.7 million. The current period general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of stock compensation expense of $2.2 million, $1.2 million related to salary expenses, $0.9 million related to our issuance of shares to Fortress pursuant to the Founders Agreement in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, $0.9 million related to legal and accounting fees and $0.9 million related to investor relation fees. The prior period general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of stock compensation expense of $2.4 million, $1.0 million related to salary expenses, $1.0 million related to legal and accounting fees, $0.7 million related to our issuance of shares to Fortress pursuant to the Founders Agreement in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock under an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the "ATM") and $0.4 million related to investor relation fees.
We anticipate general and administrative expenses in 2021 to remain relatively consistent as compared to 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $143.2 million.
In September 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 7,321,429 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.80 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $20.5 million. Total net proceeds from the offering were approximately $18.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.6 million. The shares were sold under a Registration Statement (No. 333-221493) on Form S-3 (the “2017 S-3”), filed with the SEC.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold a total of 5,104,234 shares of common stock under the ATM for aggregate total gross proceeds of approximately $12.8 million at an average selling price of $2.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $12.4 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs.
In November 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering, in which we sold 15,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.27 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $19.6 million. Total net proceeds from the offering were approximately $17.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $2.0 million. The shares were sold under the 2017 S-3.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold a total of 2,273,189 shares of common stock under the ATM for aggregate total gross proceeds of approximately $8.0 million at an average selling price of $3.52 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $7.8 million after deducting commissions and other transactions costs.
Our major sources of cash have been proceeds from the sale of equity securities. We expect to use these proceeds primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include financing our growth, developing new or existing product candidates, and funding capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances are sufficient to fund our anticipated operating cash requirements for at least one year from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We will be required to expend significant funds in order to advance the development of our product candidates. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. Further financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy and we may be forced to curtail or cease operations.
In addition to the foregoing, based on the Company’s current assessment, the Company does not expect any material impact on its long-term development timeline and its liquidity due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19. However, the Company is continuing to assess the effect on its operations by monitoring the spread of COVID-19, as well as the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s clients, vendors, and business partners, and the actions implemented to combat the virus throughout the world.

Net cash used in operating activities was $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in manufacturing of cosibelimab clinical supply in the current period.
