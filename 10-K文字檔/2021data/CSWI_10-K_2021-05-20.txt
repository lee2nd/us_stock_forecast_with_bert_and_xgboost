ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and the “Forward-Looking Statements” included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Our Company
We are a diversified industrial growth company with well-established, scalable platforms and domain expertise across two segments: Industrial Products and Specialty Chemicals. Our broad portfolio of leading products and systems provides performance optimizing solutions to our customers, helping contractors do their jobs better, faster and easier; making buildings safer and more aesthetically pleasing; protecting valuable assets from corrosion; and improving the reliability of mission critical equipment. Our products include mechanical products for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration ("HVAC/R"), grilles, registers and diffusers, building safety solutions and high-performance specialty lubricants and sealants. End markets that we serve include HVAC/R, architecturally-specified building products, plumbing, energy, rail, mining and general industrial. Our manufacturing operations are concentrated in the United States ("U.S."), Canada and Vietnam, and we have distribution operations in U.S., Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). Our products are sold directly or through designated channels both domestically and internationally.
Many of our products are used to protect the capital assets of our customers that are expensive to repair or replace and are critical to their operations. We have a source of recurring revenue from the maintenance, repair and overhaul and consumable nature of many of our products. We also provide some custom engineered products that strengthen and enhance our customer relationships. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 100 well-respected brand names, such as RectorSeal No. 5, KOPR-KOTE, Jet-Lube, Smoke Guard, Safe-T-Switch, Mighty Bracket, Balco, Whitmore Rail, Air Sentry, Oil Safe, Deacon, Leak Freeze, Greco and TRUaire.
Business Developments
On April 1, 2021, Whitmore Manufacturing, LLC (“Whitmore”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSWI, completed the formation of the previously announced joint venture with Pennzoil-Quaker State Company dba SOPUS products (“Shell”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company that comprises Shell’s U.S. lubricants business. The formation was consummated through a transaction in which Whitmore sold to Shell a 50% interest in a wholly-owned subsidiary (containing certain existing operating assets) in exchange for consideration of $13.7 million from Shell in the form of cash and intangible assets.
On December 15, 2020, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of T.A. Industries, Inc. (“TRUaire”), a leading manufacturer of grilles, registers, and diffusers for the residential and commercial HVAC/R end market, based in Santa Fe Springs, California. The acquisition also included TRUaire’s wholly-owned manufacturing facility based in Vietnam. The acquisition is expected to extend the Company’s product offerings to the HVAC market as well as add new customers and provide strategic distribution facilities. The consideration paid for TRUaire included cash of $284 million and 849,852 shares of the Company’s common stock. The cash consideration was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and 849,852 shares of common stock were reissued from treasury shares. TRUaire activity has been included in our Industrial Products segment since the acquisition date.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we committed to a plan to divest our Strathmore Products business (the "Coatings business"). This determination resulted in the reclassification of the assets comprising that business to assets held-for-sale, and a corresponding adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations to reflect discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we received an aggregate of $6.9 million for the sale of certain tangible and all intangible assets that related to our former Coatings business in multiple transactions. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we received $1.5 million for the sale of the last remaining real property owned by our former Coatings business and, as such, we do not expect to have results of discontinued operations resulting from the Coatings business in future years.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an impact on human health, the global economy and society at large. The pandemic and its resulting impacts had an adverse impact on our financial results in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as
compared with the prior year, most notably within the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased demand in certain parts of our business, including the HVAC/R end market, we expect our overall results of operations and financial condition to continue to be adversely impacted through the duration of the pandemic when compared to pre-pandemic periods. Despite strong demand in certain of our end markets and signs of recovery in others, we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude or length of the pandemic’s adverse impact, including the effects of any vaccine or its ultimate impact on our business or financial condition, due to continued uncertainty regarding (1) the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) the continued potential for short and long-term impacts on our facilities and employees, customer demand and supply chain.
All of our operations and products support critical infrastructure and are considered "essential" in all of the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took numerous measures across our operating sites to ensure we continue to place the highest priority on the health, safety and well-being of our employees, while continuing to support our customers. Through the date of this filing, our businesses have continued to operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate safeguards for our employees and without any material disruptions.
Our Markets
HVAC/R
The HVAC/R market is our largest market served and it represented approximately 42% and 31% of our net revenues in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide an extensive array of products for installation, repair and maintenance of HVAC/R systems that includes condensate switches, pans and pumps, grilles, registers and diffusers, refrigerant caps, line set covers and other chemical and mechanical products. The industry is driven by replacement and repair of existing HVAC/R systems, as well as new construction projects. New HVAC/R systems are heavily influenced by macro trends in building construction, while replacement and repair of existing HVAC/R systems are dependent on weather and age of unit. The HVAC/R market tends to be seasonal with the peak sales season beginning in March and continuing through August. Construction and repair is typically performed by contractors, and we utilize our global distribution network to drive sales of our brands to such contractors.
Architecturally-Specified Building Products
Architecturally-specified building products represented approximately 27% and 29% of our net revenues in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We manufacture and sell products such as engineered railings, smoke and fire protection systems, expansion joints and stair edge nosings for commercial buildings, multi-family housing, healthcare, education and government facilities. Sales of these products are driven by architectural specifications and safety codes. The sales process is typically long as these can be multi-year construction projects. The construction market, both commercial and multi-family, is a key driver for sales of architecturally-specified building products.
General Industrial
The general industrial end market represented approximately 10% and 13% of our net revenues in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide products focused on asset protection and reliability, including lubricants, desiccant breathers and fluid management products. The general industrial market includes the manufacture of chemicals, steel, cement, food and beverage, pulp and paper and a wide variety of other processed materials. We serve this market primarily through a network of distributors. The growth trajectory of the general industrial end market is expected to reflect a blended average of the aforementioned end use markets.
Plumbing
The plumbing market represented approximately 10% and 11% of our net revenues in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide many products to the plumbing industry including thread sealants, solvent cements, fire-stopping products, condensate switches and trap guards, as well as other mechanical products, such as drain traps. Installation is typically performed by contractors, and we utilize our global distribution network to drive sales of our products to contractors.
Energy
The energy market represented approximately 4% and 6% of our net revenues in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide market-leading lubricants and anti-seize compounds, as well as greases, for use in oilfield
drilling activity and maintenance of oilfield drilling and valve related equipment. We sell our products primarily through distributors that are strategically situated near the major oil and gas producing areas across the globe. The outlook for the energy industry is heavily dependent on the global demand expectations from developed and emerging economies, as well as oil price and local government policies relative to oil exploration, drilling, storage and transportation.
Rail
The rail market represented approximately 4% and 6% of our net revenues in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide an array of products into the rail industry, including lubricants and lubricating devices for rail lines, which increase efficiency, reduce noise and extend the life of rail equipment such as rails and wheels. We leverage our technical expertise to build relationships with key decision-makers to ensure our products meet required specifications. We sell our products primarily through a direct sales force, as well as through distribution partners. End markets for Rail include Class 1 Rail as the primary end market in North America and Transit Rail as the primary end market in all other geographies. Cyclical product classes such as farm products and petrochemical products can also impact volumes in Class 1 Rail. While coal transport is diminishing demand for Class 1 Rail in North America, global investment in Transit Rail systems is expected to more than offset this decline.
Mining
The mining market represented approximately 3% and 4% of our net revenues in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Across the globe, we provide market-leading lubricants to open gears used in large mining excavation equipment, primarily through direct sales agents, as well as a network of strategic distributors. The North American mining industry is heavily weighted toward coal production and has experienced headwinds due to continued decline in domestic coal demand, partially mitigated by the seaborne coal export market. Globally, coal demand has been robust, and focused efforts in coal markets outside of the U.S., coupled with enhanced focus on markets such as iron, gold, diamonds and uranium in Southeast Asia, South America, Africa and Russia, have delivered growth that has generally offset the weakness in North American coal demand. Outside of coal, the mining market tends to move with global industrial output as basic industrial metals such as copper, tin, aluminum, and zinc, which are critical inputs to many industrial products.
Our Outlook
We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet in fiscal year 2022, which provides us with access to capital through our cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility. Our capital allocation strategy continues to guide our investing decisions, with a priority to direct capital to the highest risk adjusted return opportunities, within the categories of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. With the strength of our financial position, we will continue to invest in financially and strategically attractive expanded product offerings, key elements of our long-term strategy of targeting long-term profitable growth. We will continue to invest our capital in maintaining our facilities and in continuous improvement initiatives. We recognize the importance of, and remain committed to, continuing to drive organic growth, as well as investing additional capital in opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns, driving increased penetration in the end markets we serve.
We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, particularly as it relates to our assessment of valuation, prospective synergies, diligence, cultural fit and ease of integration, especially in light of the economic conditions due to the pandemic.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion provides an analysis of our consolidated results of operations and results for each of our segments.
The operations of TRUaire have been included in our consolidated results of operations and in the operating results of our Industrial Products segment since December 15, 2020, the effective date of the acquisition. The operations of Petersen Metals, Inc. ("Petersen") have been included in our consolidated results of operations and in the operating results of our Industrial Products segment since April 2, 2019, the effective date of the acquisition. The operations of MSD Research, Inc. ("MSD") have been included in our consolidated results of operations and in the operating results of our Industrial Products segment since January 31, 2019, the effective date of the acquisition. All acquisitions are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Net Revenues
Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased $33.3 million, or 8.6%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the December 15, 2020 acquisition of TRUaire ($33.8 million or 8.8%). Excluding the acquisition impact, the organic sales remained relatively flat from the prior year with a slight sales decrease ($0.5 million in total or 0.1%) primarily due to decreased sales into general industrial ($9.0 million), energy ($7.5 million), rail ($5.5 million) and mining ($1.1 million) end markets, mostly offset by increased sales volumes into the HVAC/R ($22.2 million) and architecturally-specified building products ($2.0 million) end markets. Although the energy and mining end markets decreased over the prior fiscal year, those decreases occurred during the first nine months of the fiscal year, while the fourth fiscal quarter showed improvements as compared with the same period in the prior year. The plumbing end market experienced growth in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared with the same period in the prior year, offsetting the slight decreases in the first nine months of the fiscal year.
Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased $35.7 million, or 10.2%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to recent acquisitions ($15.1 million or 4.3%) and organic sales increases ($20.6 million in total or 5.9%) driven by increased sales volumes into the HVAC/R ($12.0 million), plumbing ($3.2 million), architecturally-specified building products ($2.1 million), rail ($1.2 million), mining ($1.2 million) and general industrial ($0.9 million) end markets. Although the mining and rail end markets increased over the prior fiscal year, those increases occurred during the first nine months of the fiscal year, while the fourth fiscal quarter was relatively flat as compared with the same period in the prior year. The energy end market experienced growth in the first nine months of the fiscal year, but declines in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared with the same period in the prior year offset most of that growth.
Net revenues into the Americas, the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and the Asia Pacific regions represented approximately 93%, 4%, and 3%, respectively, of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021. Net revenues into the Americas, EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions represented approximately 90%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of net revenues for both of the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. The presentation of net revenues by geographic region is based on the location of the customer. For additional information regarding net revenues by geographic region, see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased $7.8 million, or 4.4%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the TRUaire acquisition, partially offset by decreased gross margin and an $0.8 million gain on sales of property, plant and equipment in the prior year that did not recur. Gross profit margin for the year ended March 31, 2021 of 44.1% decreased from 45.9% for the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the TRUaire acquisition, including a $3.5 million amortization related to the inventory fair value step-up, and increased freight and transportation costs in the fourth fiscal quarter.
Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased $15.7 million, or 9.7%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, recent acquisitions and an $0.8 million gain on sales of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a $2.6 million gain on sales of property, plant and equipment in the prior year period that did not recur. Gross profit margin for the year ended March 31, 2020 of 45.9% decreased from 46.1% for the year ended March 31, 2019, primarily attributable to product mix.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased $14.3 million, or 12.9%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to transaction expenses related to the TRUaire acquisition ($7.8 million) and the formation of a joint venture in our Specialty Chemicals segment ($2.6 million), the inclusion of TRUaire's operations and employee severance costs ($0.7 million), partially offset by reduced spend on travel and entertainment expenses and a trademark impairment ($1.0 million) in the prior year that did not recur. The increase in operating expense as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to transaction expenses discussed above.
Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased $10.1 million, or 10.0%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions ($3.2 million), and increased employee-related costs, as well as a net increase in trademark impairments and write-offs ($0.6 million). Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2020 was comparable to the year ended March 31, 2019, as leverage on increased revenues was partially offset by increased employee-related costs.
Operating Income
Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2021 decreased by $6.6 million, or 10.0%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was a result of the $14.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense, partially offset by the $7.8 million increase in gross profit.
Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased by $5.6 million, or 9.3%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was a result of the $15.7 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $10.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense as discussed above.
Other income and expense
Interest expense, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased $1.1 million to $2.4 million as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020, due to increased borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility (described in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report) to fund a portion of the purchase price for the TRUaire acquisition.
Interest expense, net for the year ended March 31, 2020 decreased $0.1 million to $1.3 million as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to an overall reduction in average outstanding debt under our Revolving Credit Facility, as well as lower interest rates.
Other expense, net decreased by $1.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2021 to expense of $6.0 million as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to an indemnification expense of $5.0 million due to the partial release of a tax indemnification asset related to the TRUaire acquisition and loss arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies, entirely offset by a charge of $6.5 million resulting from the termination of our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and a lease termination cost of $0.5 million in the prior year that did not recur.
Other income (expense), net decreased by $9.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to expense of $7.1 million as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a charge of $6.5 million resulting from the termination of our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, $1.8 million of gains on sales of non-operating assets in the prior year that did not recur, and a lease termination cost of $0.5 million.
Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate
The provision for income taxes for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $10.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 21.2%, as compared with the provision of $12.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.2%, for the year ended March 31, 2020 and the provision of $15.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%, for the year ended March 31, 2019. As compared with the statutory rate for the year ended March 31, 2021, the provision for income taxes was primarily impacted by the release of uncertain tax positions, which decreased the provision by $4.7 million and the effective rate by 9.2% offset by the state tax expense (net of federal benefits), which increased the provision by $2.4 million and the effective rate by 4.7% and additional non-deductible expenses, which increased the provision by $1.4 million and the effective rate by 2.8%.
As compared with the statutory rate for the year ended March 31, 2020, the provision for income taxes was primarily impacted by the state tax expense (net of federal benefits), which increased the provision by $1.9 million and the effective rate by 3.4%, and the release of uncertain tax positions, which decreased the provision by $1.6 million and the effective rate by 2.8%. Other items impacting the effective tax rate for the prior years include adjustments for the closing of the IRS audit for tax year ended March 31, 2017, foreign withholding tax paid during the tax year ended March 31, 2020 for prior year periods, and the reversal of a pension adjustment related to a former wholly-owned subsidiary for the tax period ended September 30, 2015, in which the statute of limitations expired.
We recorded total tax contingency reserves of $17.3 million, including unrecognized tax benefit of $13.6 million, accrued interest and penalty of $1.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, through purchase accounting as a result of the TRUaire acquisition discussed in Note 2. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, a tax benefit of $5.3 million, including release of accrued interest ($0.6 million) and penalty ($0.6 million), was recognized as a result of receiving the audit closing letter from Internal Revenue Service related to calendar 2017, a pre-acquisition tax year. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the interest and penalties related to the uncertain tax position resulted in a net decrease of $0.9 million in income tax expense. We accrued interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions of $1.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, as of the year ended March 31, 2021. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our income tax provision.
We are currently under examination by the IRS for a short period return ending September 30, 2015 for a CSWI subsidiary company. Our federal income tax returns for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 remain subject to examination. Our income tax returns for TRUaire's pre-acquisiton periods including calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019 remain subject to examinations. Our income tax returns in certain state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for various periods for the period ended September 30, 2015 and subsequent years.
As of both March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no tax effected operating loss carryforwards net of valuation allowances. Net operating loss carryforwards will expire in periods beyond the next five years.
Business Segments
We conduct our operations through two business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment’s operating income. The key operating results for our two business segments are discussed below.
Industrial Products Segment Results
Industrial Products includes specialty mechanical products, fire and smoke protection products, architecturally-specified building products and storage, filtration and application equipment for use with our specialty chemicals and other products for general industrial application.
Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased $54.5 million, or 23.2%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the TRUaire acquisition ($33.8 million or 14.4%) and organic sales increases ($20.7 million in total or 8.8%) driven by increased sales volumes into the HVAC/R ($20.3 million), architecturally-specified building products ($4.8 million) and plumbing ($1.4 million) end markets, partially offset by decreases in rail ($2.7 million) and general industrial ($3.1 million) end markets.
Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased $29.0 million, or 14.1%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to recent acquisitions ($15.1 million or 7.3%) and organic sales increases ($13.9 million in total or 6.8%) driven by increased sales volumes into the HVAC/R ($12.0 million) and plumbing ($2.6 million) end markets, partially offset by a decline in the rail ($0.5 million) end market.
Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2021 decreased $0.1 million, or 0.2%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to transaction expenses related to the TRUaire acquisition ($7.8 million), partially offset by increased revenues.
Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased $6.9 million, or 14.2%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions ($4.0 million) and increased revenues, partially offset by a $0.5 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment in the prior year that did not recur.
Specialty Chemicals Segment Results
Specialty Chemicals includes pipe thread sealants, firestopping sealants and caulks, adhesives/solvent cements, lubricants and greases, drilling compounds, anti-seize compounds, chemical formulations and degreasers and cleaners.
Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 decreased $21.2 million, or 14.0%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales volumes into the energy ($7.5 million), general industrial ($6.0 million), architecturally-specified building products ($2.8 million), rail ($2.7 million) and mining ($1.1 million) end markets.
Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased $6.8 million, or 4.7%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes into the architecturally-specified building products ($2.1 million), rail ($1.7 million), general industrial ($1.3 million), mining ($1.2 million) and plumbing ($0.6 million) end markets.
Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2021 decreased $6.4 million, or 26.0%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales and $2.6 million of transaction expenses related to the formation of a joint venture, partially offset by decreases in travel and personnel-related expenses and sales commissions.
Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased $0.8 million, or 3.2%, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues, partially offset by a net decrease in year-over-year gains on sales of property, plant and equipment ($1.4 million) and an increase in net trademark impairments and write-offs ($0.6 million).
For additional information on segments, see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flow Analysis
Existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our cash balance at March 31, 2021 was $10.1 million, as compared with $18.3 million at March 31, 2020.
For the year ended March 31, 2021, our cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $66.3 million, as compared with $71.4 million and $68.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•Working capital used cash for the year ended March 31, 2021 due to higher accounts receivable ($7.2 million), higher prepaid expenses and other current assets ($4.2 million) and higher inventories ($3.4 million), partially offset by higher accounts payable and other current liabilities ($13.9 million).
•Working capital provided cash for the year ended March 31, 2020 due to higher accounts payable and other current liabilities ($5.9 million) and lower prepaid expenses and other current assets ($4.0 million), mostly offset by higher accounts receivable ($8.0 million) and higher inventories ($1.7 million).
•Working capital used cash for the year ended March 31, 2019 due to higher inventory ($5.5 million) and higher accounts receivable ($3.8 million), partially offset by higher accounts payable and other current liabilities ($5.7 million).
Cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended March 31, 2021 were $289.9 million as compared with $22.0 million and $10.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•Capital expenditures during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $8.8 million, $11.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures have been focused on enterprise resource planning systems, new product introductions, capacity expansion, continuous improvement, automation and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
•During the year ended March 31, 2021 we acquired TRUaire for $286.9 million (after working capital adjustment) in cash consideration and stock consideration valued at $97.7 million, during the year ended March 31, 2020 we acquired Petersen for $11.8 million, and during the year ended March 31, 2019, we acquired MSD for $10.1 million, net of cash acquired, as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Cash flows used in financing activities during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $214.0 million, $57.2 million and $39.3 million, respectively. Cash outflows resulted from:
•Repayments on our lines of credit (as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report) of $23.6 million, $28.1 million and $20.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•Repurchases of shares under our share repurchase programs (as discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report) of $7.7 million, $26.5 million and $45.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•Dividend payments of $8.1 million and $8.1 million during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No dividends were paid during the years ended March 31, 2019.
Cash inflows resulted from borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of $255.0 million, $7.5 million and $28.0 million during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We believe that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through operations and cash available under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report contains a discussion of our acquisitions.
