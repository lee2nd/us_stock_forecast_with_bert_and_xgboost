Overview
Kennedy Wilson is a global real estate investment company. We own, operate and develop real estate with the objective of maximizing earnings over the long run for ourselves and our equity partners. We focus primarily on multifamily and office properties located in the Western United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland. As of December 31, 2020, we have 202 employees in 12 offices primarily located throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain. As of December 31, 2020, our AUM stood at $17.6 billion. The real estate that we hold in our global portfolio consists primarily of (51%) multifamily apartments and (49%) commercial offices based on Consolidated NOI and JV NOI. Geographically, we focus on the (58%) Western United States, the (21%) United Kingdom and (17%) Ireland (including 4% in other).
COVID-19 Impact and Business Update
The following discussion is intended to provide shareholders with certain information regarding the Company's operations and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and management’s efforts to respond to the same. The pandemic commenced during the first quarter of 2020 and the duration and magnitude of it still remain uncertain at this time. Unless otherwise specified, the statistical and other information regarding our portfolio and tenants are estimates based on information available to us as of February 18, 2021. As a result of the rapid development, fluidity and uncertainty surrounding this situation, we expect that such statistical and other information may change, potentially significantly, going forward and may not be indicative of the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition for 2021 and future periods.
Health and Safety of our Employees and Tenants
Our primary objective during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to protect the health and safety of our employees as well as the tenants and service providers across our portfolio. We have started to open our offices in jurisdictions where applicable laws permit us to do so. Even with the reopening of certain offices, to date, we have not made it mandatory for employees to return to the office if they can perform their jobs from home. Prior to reopening any office, we have strictly followed applicable laws in preparing and maintaining the space to be as safe as possible and providing an environment that encourages the following of social distancing guidelines, including, without limitation, staggering employees' schedules to ensure ample space is available between work spaces and occupied offices. In jurisdictions where applicable laws have not permitted us to reopen our offices, our employees continue to work remotely. We will continue to monitor and follow local laws and guidance to assess our ability to reopen or keep open our offices across the globe. Our IT infrastructure and communications are robust and we are focused on maintaining business continuity, while doing our share to support each community where we do business. The daily operations of our business are not materially directly dependent on a supply chain or production chain that may be disrupted due to the pandemic.
Impact to the Global Economy and Jurisdictions We Invest in
As a result of the unprecedented measures taken across the globe, the disruption and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the global economy and financial markets has been significant. We continue to closely monitor changes in applicable laws and COVID-19 guidance provided by local, state and federal regulators, or their equivalents, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Nearly all the markets in which we operate continue to enforce some form of restriction on the operations of businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These precautions led to the shutdown of nonessential services, which led to closures of stores in our retail portfolio and limited business operations of some of our office tenants. In addition, this caused us to close The Shelbourne hotel in Dublin, Ireland from March 15, 2020 to June 29, 2020. On October 21, 2020, due to a spike in new cases, Ireland implemented new lockdown measures that closed non-essential businesses and limited travel from home to a
distance of five kilometers for several weeks. Although Ireland eased restrictions in December, it has since implemented another national lockdown effective January 1, 2021 that remains in effect through at least March 5, 2021. Although the Shelbourne has remained open since June 30, 2020, we have experienced and continue to expect significantly limited activity at the property. Additionally, in early January 2021, the United Kingdom also implemented a national lockdown that closes non-essential businesses as cases have continued to rise there as well.
The continued and long-lasting economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to some of our multifamily tenants having difficulty in making rental payments on time, or at all. The Department of Labor reported that as of the end January 2021, the unemployment rate was 6.3%, with 14.8 million people reporting they had been unable to work because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic. Although the unemployment number has come down from its peak in April and May 2020, many sectors of the economy still remain at a virtual standstill. The Bureau of Economic Analysis ("BEA") reported that the U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") shrank 4.8% in the first quarter 2020 and 34.3% in the second quarter of 2020. Coming off the second quarter 2020, which was the worst quarter in history for GDP growth, the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace ever in the third quarter 2020 and continued to grow in the fourth quarter, however we expect continued uncertainty going forward as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to effect the global economy.
Liquidity
Kennedy Wilson has a strong financial and capital position to withstand the potential near-term cash flow impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we had $965.1 million ($640.3 million of which is in foreign currencies of GBP or EUR) of cash on our consolidated balance sheet. We also currently have $300 million available to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility.
As of December 31, 2020, we have 4.1 weighted average years to maturity on our debt obligations. We have limited debt maturities over 2021, which total $123.7 million which are secured by non-recourse property-level financings and represent only 2% of our total outstanding debt obligations. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we also closed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes,” and together with the 2029 Notes, the “Notes”). We intend to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repurchase (through a previously announced tender offer) or redeem $1 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”).
Investment portfolio and Fourth Quarter 2020 and 2021 Rent Collections
As of February 18, 2021, we have collected a total of 95% of our share of rents for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 from our properties in our global investment portfolio. As of February 18, 2021, our share of rent collections for the month of January 2021 has been materially in line with rent collection levels that we achieved in prior periods. Such collection rates may not be indicative of collections in any future period. As of December 31, 2020, 86% of our share of the total rents that we collect are generated from our global multifamily and office properties. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified $15.0 million of receivables and other lease-related assets that are no longer probable of being collected. Accordingly, the Company will account for these leases on a cash basis and recognize rental income to the extent the Company receives cash from the tenants. Of the $15.0 million identified, $13.5 million related to our Consolidated portfolio and was recorded as a reduction of rental income and $1.5 million related to our share of rental income on our Co-Investments portfolio investments and was recorded as a reduction of income from unconsolidated investments.
Global Multifamily Property Portfolio Rents and Leasing Updates
As of February 18, 2021, we have collected a total of 98% of our share of rents for the year ended December 31, 2020 from our properties in our global multifamily property portfolio. January 2021 rental collections have been in line with prior periods. We have benefited from certain of our tenants taking advantage of the various legislation passed in the United States and other jurisdictions where we hold multifamily assets. Our multifamily tenants typically pay through direct debit transactions, and tenants within our affordable unit portfolio generally receive some assistance from various government programs, which helps enhance our collection efforts. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, however, some of our multifamily tenants may have difficulty in making rental payments on time, or at all.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic our multifamily group has rolled out initiatives and achieved the following accomplishments:
•Placed greater emphasis on virtual leasing during 2020.
•Virtual paperless leasing capabilities are in place across our global multifamily property portfolio. Improved the virtual tour experience with updated video and 360-degree imagery as well as video tours of available units.
•Occupancy and in-place rents has increased slightly to 95.2% and $1,684 per unit at December 31, 2020 from 94.4% and $1,675 per unit December 31, 2019.
Global Commercial Property Portfolio Rents and Leasing Update
As of February 18, 2021, we have collected 98% of our share of rents for the year ended December 31, 2020 from properties in our global office property portfolio and 80% of our share of rents for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the properties in our global retail property portfolio. January 2021 rental collections have been in line with prior periods. As of December 31, 2020, 12% of the total rents that we collect are generated from our global retail portfolio and 30% are generated from our global office portfolio.
We also have a small number of investments in assets located in Spain and Italy that sit in our global commercial property portfolio. All of our Italian properties are fully occupied by government agencies and have paid rent through the end of January 2021. As of February 18, 2021, we have collected 56% of our share of rents for the year ended December 31, 2020 at our Spanish retail properties. January 2021 rental collections have been in line with prior periods. The Spanish portfolio comprises 2% of our global portfolio monthly rental collections.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic our commercial group has rolled out initiatives and achieved the following accomplishments:
•Similar to our multifamily portfolio we are utilizing virtual leasing technology for our commercial portfolio. During year ended December 31, 2020, we closed on approximately 227 leasing deals across 2.6 million sq. ft.
◦In the Western United States, we closed 84 leasing deals across 1.1 million sq. ft
◦In United Kingdom and Ireland, we closed 143 leasing deals across 1.5 million sq. ft
Global Development and Hotel Update
In our development and redevelopment portfolio we have experienced delays, but we currently do not expect material cost increases as we have fixed-rate construction contracts on projects that are currently under construction and for projects that are in early phases we have not had to halt activities as we are mainly in the pre-construction phase and are able to continue progress on projects. Ireland is currently in a nationwide lockdown that started on January 8, 2021 with an expected reopening date of March 5, 2021, which has halted construction during the lockdown. We expect that this will push out our timeline on development projects by four months but we believe that any associated costs can be covered within our existing contingency plans on the assumption that there are no further lockdowns. We have three properties that consist of 0.1 million square feet of office space and 277 market rate multifamily units that should complete construction by the end of 2021. We also have five properties consisting of 0.3 million square feet of commercial space and 576 market rate multifamily units that are unstabilized and undergoing lease up that we expect will be stabilized by the end of 2021. Our VHH portfolio also has 932 units that we expect will finish construction or complete lease up by the end of 2021. Please refer to Development and Redevelopment in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for a more detailed discussion regarding our development initiatives.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to significantly impact the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home or similar directives resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world. We voluntarily closed the Shelbourne hotel on March 15, 2020 and reopened the hotel on June 29, 2020 when we were permitted to do so under applicable laws and guidelines. On October 21, 2020, due to a spike in new cases Ireland has moved to a six week lockdown that closed non-essential businesses and limits travel from home to a distance of five kilometers. As discussed above Ireland will be in lockdown for the majority of the first quarter of 2021. The Shelbourne will remain open during this period but we expect significantly limited activity at the property. Revenues at the Shelbourne hotel for the year ended December 31, 2020 were down 63% and Consolidated NOI was down approximately $14 million compared to the prior year due to the hotel closure during the reporting period.
Investment Activity
Investment activity may be diminished until a majority of people have been vaccinated or there has been a significant reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases. This slowdown in investment transactions may impact our ability to sell properties in the future and our ability to generate cash and gains from the sale of real estate. Despite historically low transactions in the second and third quarter of 2020, we had an active fourth quarter 2020 during which the majority of our 2020 asset sales were completed, as evidenced by the sale of Baggot Plaza, a wholly-owned office property in Dublin, Ireland, Club Palisades, a wholly-owned multifamily property in the state of Washington and the contributions of 18 previously wholly-owned industrial properties located in the United Kingdom to a newly created joint venture with sovereign wealth fund (which the Company will hold a 20% ownership interest in and act as a general partner). These asset dispositions generated a total gain
on sale of $287.0 million. In addition to these asset dispositions, in October 2020, we acquired off-market three multifamily properties totaling 880-units in the mountain states region of the Western U.S. for $198 million. We have also seen a strong response to our new debt platform and expect deal activity to continue in 2021.

Kennedy Wilson Consolidated Financial Results: Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Financial Highlights
GAAP net income to common shareholders was $92.9 million and $224.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA was $608.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 16% decrease from $728.1 million for 2019, primarily due to lower gains on sale of real estate in our Consolidated and Co-Investment portfolios and lower fair value gains on our commingled funds and VHH. We were a net seller of assets and during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our share of net sales of assets were $741.6 million and $115.5 million, respectively. NOI from our properties was down in 2020 primarily due to a significant decrease to our hotel business as a result of COVID-related shutdowns and closures. The impact from lower gains on sales of real estate and NOI was partially offset by reductions in compensation and general and administrative expenses due to a lower headcount as a result of the sale of our Property Services group in the beginning of the fourth quarter 2020. We also had lower travel and office related expenses and lower discretionary compensation. With proceeds from asset sales, we have funded development and redevelopment initiatives that, once complete, we expect will increase the NOI we receive from our properties (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Development and Redevelopment").
Operational Highlights
Same store property highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020 include:
•For our 14,728 same property multifamily units for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior period:
◦occupancy increased 1% to 95%
◦net operating income decreased 1%
◦total revenues increased 1%
•For 11.2 million square feet of same property commercial real estate for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior period:
◦occupancy remained flat at 96% from the same period in 2019
◦net operating income decreased 7.5%
◦total revenues decreased 6.7%
•Investment Transactions
◦acquired $1.1 billion of assets (our share of which was $242.0 million) and sold $1.2 billion of assets (our share of which was $983.6 million)
•Significant Transactions
•Consolidated Asset Sales; New Separate Account
In 2020, among other sales, the Company sold Pioneer Point, a wholly-owned multifamily property in the United Kingdom, Baggot Plaza, a wholly-owned office property in Ireland, Club Palisades, a wholly-owned multifamily property in the state of Washington and contributed 18 previously wholly-owned industrial properties located in the United Kingdom to a newly-created joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund (the “Industrial JV”). These transactions generated cash proceeds of $649.3 million to the Company and a total gain of $307.1 million. The proceeds from these sales were and will be used to fund development projects and new acquisitions. Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Development and Redevelopment” for additional details with respect to these projects.
The Company will continue to hold a 20% ownership interest in the assets contributed to the joint venture through its ownership interests in the Industrial JV. The Industrial JV will target urban logistics properties in the United Kingdom, with the potential to expand into Ireland and Spain. As the Company does not control the Industrial JV, the assets are no longer consolidated and its investment in the Industrial JV is accounted for under the equity method. The Company elected the fair value option and going forward the investments are accounted for as fair value unconsolidated investments with operating activity included within income from unconsolidated investments.
•AXA Joint Venture and Related Transactions
During the second quarter of 2018, the Company and AXA Investment Managers - Real Assets ("AXA") entered into a joint venture agreement targeting multifamily assets in Ireland. The AXA joint venture commenced with AXA investing in a 50% ownership stake in 1,173 multifamily units across three assets in Dublin, Ireland previously held by the Company and a different equity partner (held in 50/50 joint ventures) and was initially consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. The
Company continues to hold a 50% ownership interest in these assets through its ownership in this new joint venture with AXA. As the Company does not control the joint venture with AXA, the assets are no longer consolidated and its investment with AXA is accounted for under the equity method. The investments are accounted for as fair value unconsolidated investments with operating activity included within income from unconsolidated investments.
During the third quarter of 2018, the Company sold an additional 411 multifamily units across two assets in Dublin, Ireland and one in Cork, Ireland into the joint venture with AXA that were both previously wholly owned by the Company. The joint venture has also made investments in 274 units in Dublin and acquired two development sites on which it expects to build an estimated 684 additional units (collectively with the transactions described in the paragraph above the "2018 AXA Transactions").
During the second quarter of 2019, AXA invested in a 50% ownership stake in the State Street office building, Capital Dock office buildings and Capital Dock residential tower in Dublin, Ireland that was previously held by the Company and different equity partners. These investments were previously consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company sold 468 multifamily units across three assets in Dublin, Ireland into the joint venture with AXA that were previously wholly owned by the Company (collectively with the transactions described in the paragraph directly above the "2019 AXA Transactions" and with the 2018 AXA Transactions "AXA Transactions").
The table below summarizes the impact AXA Transactions had on our consolidated financial statements during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
In addition to the net gain on sale of real estate we earned $12.4 million and $9.4 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 which were recorded through net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We also had $2.1 million and $1.5 million on acquisition and disposition fees recorded to investment management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we recognized $47.3 million and $25.3 million of fair value gains on assets held within the AXA joint venture including $4.9 million and $4.3 million of performance fees, respectively. Gains were due to property and foreign exchange appreciation offset by fair value losses on debt.
The deconsolidation of the assets above has led to a decrease in total assets and total liabilities as we have gone from showing 100% of the gross balance sheet items to our net investment through unconsolidated investments. Prior to deconsolidation these assets had an asset value of $1.0 billion and as of December 31, 2019 they have an unconsolidated investment balance of $401.7 million.
There were no significant transactions completed by the AXA joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Issuance of Preferred Stock
In October 2019, the Company announced the issuance of a $300 million perpetual preferred equity investment in Kennedy Wilson by affiliates of Eldridge Industries (collectively, "Eldridge"). Under the terms of the agreement, Eldridge purchased $300 million in convertible perpetual preferred stock carrying a 5.75% annual dividend rate, with an initial conversion price of $25.00 per share, representing a premium of 15% to the daily volume weighted average price per share of Kennedy Wilson’s common stock over the 20 trading days ending, and including, October 16, 2019. The preferred stock is callable by Kennedy Wilson on and after October 15, 2024.
•Sale of Kennedy-Wilson Properties, LTD. ("KWP Sale")
On October 2, 2020, we sold KWP, a wholly owned subsidiary operating in the third-party real estate services industry, including property management, commercial brokerage (leasing and sale), facilities management and lease administration, to an entity controlled by certain members of KWP's management (the “Purchaser”). As part of the transaction, 110 employees and 25 independent contractors that were employed by KWP are now employed by the Purchaser.
Foreign Exchange - Results of Operations
A significant portion of our investments are in foreign currencies. We typically do not hedge future operations or cash flows so changes in foreign currency rates will have an impact on our results of operations. We have included the table below to illustrate the impact these fluctuations have had on our revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA by applying the relevant exchange rates for the prior period. Please refer to the section titled "Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies" in Item 3 for a discussion of risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy and the "Other Comprehensive Income" section below for a discussion of the balance sheet impact of foreign currency movements on our results of operations.
Consolidated Portfolio Segment
Revenues
Rental income was $403.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $447.4 million for 2019. The $43.5 million decrease is primarily due to selling a 50% equity interest of certain previously consolidated properties to the AXA joint venture in the second and fourth quarters of 2019. The assets sold include the State Street office building, Capital Dock office and residential buildings and the Central Park multifamily properties which caused these investments to move from our Consolidated Portfolio to our Co-Investment Portfolio. As the assets are now treated as unconsolidated investments (with our ownership percentage remaining the same with respect to certain assets and our ownership percentage dropping with respect to certain assets), our share of rental revenues is part of income from unconsolidated investments in the current period and is no longer treated as consolidated rental revenue. The income that we receive from the 50% of the ownership interests in these assets that we hold after these transactions with AXA moved from being recognized as rental income to income from unconsolidated investments during the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized a $13.5 million reduction to rental income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as we assessed the full collection of certain rents as no longer probable. We had no comparable activity in the prior period.
Hotel income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $80.5 million for 2019. The $66.6 million decrease is primarily due to the sale of two consolidated hotels during the fourth quarter of 2019 ($32.9 million decrease) and the decline in hotel income due to operations being significantly reduced or halted at the Shelbourne hotel ($33.7 million decrease) as a result of the COVID pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Expenses
Rental expenses decreased to $135.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is due to the sale of assets into the AXA joint venture as discussed above. As the assets are now treated as unconsolidated investments (with our ownership percentage remaining the same with respect to certain assets and our ownership percentage dropping with respect to certain assets), our share of rental expenses is part of income from unconsolidated investments in the current period and is no longer treated as consolidated rental expense. Additional decreases in rental expenses were recognized year-over-year as a result of certain one-time non-capitalizable repair and maintenance expenses that we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 to prepare an office property in the United Kingdom for a new tenant. We recognized additional decreases as a result of a reduction in property taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a property tax refund on an office property in the United Kingdom.
Hotel expenses decreased to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the sale of two consolidated hotels during the fourth quarter of 2019 ($26.3 million decrease) and the reduced activity at the Shelbourne hotel ($20.0 million) during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Compensation expense decreased to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower discretionary compensation expense.
General and administrative expenses decreased to $20.6 million for year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a substantial overall decrease in general and administrative expenses across the board, including travel and office expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Depreciation and amortization decreased by $8.0 million primarily due to sale of assets into the AXA joint venture and sales of assets in the prior period.
Other
Gains on sale of real estate, net were $338.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $434.4 million in the prior period. The gains recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relate to the sale of UK industrial portfolio to the Industrial JV, the Club Palisades multifamily property in the Western United States, Baggot Plaza in Dublin, Ireland, Pioneer Point a multifamily property in the United Kingdom and certain other non-core assets in Europe. Included in the gains on sale of real estate, net for December 31, 2020 is an impairment loss of $15.6 million on five retail properties in the United Kingdom and a residential property in the Western United States. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the activity relates to the deconsolidation of the investments that went into the AXA joint venture (as described above), the sale of the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Lake Tahoe and smaller, non-core retail assets in the Western United States and non-core commercial properties in the United Kingdom.
Interest expense was $211.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $215.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is due to lower consolidated property level debt balances resulting from the sale of assets into the AXA joint venture and sales of assets in the current and prior period. These decreases were offset by $9.3 million in prepayment penalties associated with the KWE tender offer completed in 2020, early repayment of mortgages on assets as part of the UK Industrial portfolio sale and the refinance of a mortgage on a multifamily property in the Western United States.
Transaction-related expenses were $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease is due to expenses incurred in 2019 investigating potential transactions that ultimately were not consummated.
We had net income of $2.3 million attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net income of $94.4 million attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interest is due to allocation of gains in 2019 associated with the sale of Ritz Carlton, Lake Tahoe hotel and the AXA joint venture to our equity partners.
Co-Investment Portfolio Segment
Investment Management
On our Co-Investment Portfolio assets, we receive asset management fees for managing assets on behalf of our partners. During the year ended December 31, 2020, fees recorded through revenues were $22.5 million as compared to $24.9 million for the same period in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020 we had higher base management fees as a result of having more assets under management in our Co-Investment platform mainly from the AXA joint venture. However, this was offset by $6.4 million of acquisition related fees that we received from equity partners in the prior period with no comparable activity in the current period. These fees are recorded as a component of investment management, property services and research fees. Performance fees are recorded as part of income from unconsolidated investments and discussed below.
Expenses increased to $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $20.7 million primarily due to severance costs and costs associated with our fund management business including certain discretionary compensation.
Co-investment operations
In addition to our management of investments in the Co-Investment Portfolio, we have ownership interests in the properties. The table below represents a breakout of the amounts within income from unconsolidated investments which represents our share of underlying property investments in the Co-Investment Portfolio assets and any performance fees relating to our management of these properties for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019:
Our share of JV NOI (rental income net of rental operating expenses) increased in the current period due to the sale of interests in previously consolidated properties into unconsolidated partnerships resulting in moving the recognition of income from these assets from our Consolidated portfolio to our Co-Investment portfolio as described above. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we received a surrender premium, which is a breakage fee we received from a tenant in the United Kingdom related to the early extinguishment of its lease and we experienced an increase in NOI in our VHH portfolio. Increases in JV NOI were offset by an impairment loss recorded in the third quarter of 2020 included in the table above within loss on sale of real estate of $6.7 million relating to a property in a retail portfolio in the United Kingdom that was subsequently sold during the year. We had an additional impairment loss of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter 2020 on this portfolio that brought the carrying value of this joint venture to zero. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had gains on sale of real estate of $53.5 million primarily relating to the sale of two multifamily properties in the Western United States which was offset by an impairment of $10.3 million on a residential development in the Western United States that was subsequently sold in the first quarter of 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 we had fair value gains on VHH primarily relating to conversions of development projects to operating properties as construction work was completed and lease up of the properties commenced. We also had fair value gains associated with the completion of Clancy Quay Phase 3 which is currently undergoing lease up and net foreign exchange gains relating to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar on our euro denominated fair value investments.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had higher fair value gains on VHH due to resyndications and improved property performance on the underlying investments within VHH.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net $2.6 million increase in the accrual for performance fees. This was mainly due to increased values in the AXA joint venture primarily due to the completion of Clancy Quay Phase 3 as further discussed above and a portfolio of office buildings we manage in the Seattle area. These increases were offset by reductions in accrued performance fees associated Fund V and VI due to lack of transactional activity for the period. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had approximately $18 million of performance fee income accruals in Fund V and VI from increases in fair value and realized gains. We also had approximately $12 million in promote fees from a portfolio of multifamily assets held at fair value in a Las Vegas held in a separate account platform that sold in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Corporate
Real estate related services fees decreased to $10.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $16.5 million for December 31, 2019, primarily due to the sale of KWP at the beginning of the fourth quarter as discussed above.
Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $74.6 million as compared to $80.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Compensation and related expenses decreased by $5.4 million due to the sale of KWP and lower discretionary compensation.
Interest expense was $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was flat to the same period in 2019.
Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for 2020 was $43.6 million and 28.8% as compared to $41.4 million and a 11.4% effective tax rate in 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is primarily due to non-deductible executive compensation as a percentage of pretax income being higher, a reduction in income allocable to non-controlling interests and an increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, valuation allowances were recorded against certain UK and Spanish subsidiaries' tax loss carryforwards as their ability to generate future income has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Preferred dividends and accretion on preferred stock issuance costs were $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase is due to the Company issued 300,000 shares of its 5.75% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), for gross proceeds of $300 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Other Comprehensive Income
The two major components that drive the change in other comprehensive income are the changes in foreign currency rates and the gains or loss of any associated foreign currency hedges. Please refer to the section titled "Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies" in Item 3 for a discussion of our risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy. Below is a table that details the activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Included within the net income attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders are realized foreign exchange amounts relating to translation of cash amounts held in different functional currencies of the subsidiary that holds it and realized gains and losses on derivative investments that are not treated as net investment hedges. The table below represents the amount of foreign exchange movements recorded to the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The main currencies that the Company has exposure to are the euro and pound sterling. The table below represents the change in rates over the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as compared to the U.S. Dollar:
Comprehensive income, net of taxes and noncontrolling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $116.5 million and $248.6 million, respectively. The Company experienced net unrealized gains on foreign currency through other comprehensive income for the period due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and GBP. Unrealized hedge losses were driven by hedges that KWE holds on its euro denominated investments which were offset by hedges that the Company has on its GBP denominated investments. The unrealized hedge losses on KWE primarily related to cross currency swap and KWE Notes due to the euro strengthening against the GBP. See Foreign Currency in Item 1. Business section for more detail on the foreign currency impact of these instruments.
The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to swap some of its variable rate mortgage loans to fixed rate terms. The Company recognized $4.2 million of interest expense savings that were recorded to the statement of operations relating to interest savings on interest rate swaps and forward point amortization on hedge contracts.
Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income are for amounts associated with the AXA joint venture that are moved out of other comprehensive income and recognized on the consolidated statements of income.
Kennedy Wilson Consolidated Financial Results: Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Financial Highlights
GAAP net income to common shareholders was $224.1 million and $150.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA was $728.1 million, a 2% increase from $712.7 million for 2018, due primarily to higher realized gains on the sale of consolidated and unconsolidated real estate investments and higher fair value gains and performance fees. These were offset by a gain on the sale of our Meyers Research business during the year ended December 31, 2018. Also we were a net seller of assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our share of net asset sales of assets were $115.5 million and $348.4 million, respectively. We also had foreign currency exchange losses and some disruption to our hotel business due to value-add capital expenditures all of which contributed to a decrease in NOI from our properties. This was partially offset by increases in rental income and NOI at our same store operating properties as described below as we executed our asset management initiatives. With proceeds from asset sales, we have funded development and redevelopment initiatives that, once complete, we expect will increase the NOI we receive from our properties (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Development and Redevelopment").
Operational Highlights
Same property highlights for the year ended December 31, 2019 include:
•For our 13,387 same property multifamily units for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period:
◦occupancy remained at 94% from 2018.
◦net operating income increased 7%
◦total revenues increased 5%
•For 11.2 million square feet of same property commercial real estate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period:
◦occupancy decreased 0.1% to 96.9% from the same period in 2018
◦net operating income decreased 3.7%
◦total revenues decreased 3.6%
•Investment Transactions
◦acquired $1.9 billion of assets (our share of which was $624.6 million) and sold $1.4 billion of assets (our share of which was $740.1 million)
•Significant Transactions
◦Meyers Research Sale
In December 2018, we sold Meyers Research for $48.0 million and recognized a gain on sale of business of $40.4 million. We used part of the proceeds from such sale to reinvest $15.0 million for an 11% ownership interest in a new partnership between Meyers Research and another premiere residential real estate construction service company. We no longer control Meyers Research and treat the investment as an unconsolidated investment.
Please also see the description of certain other significant transactions described in “Kennedy Wilson Consolidated Financial Results: Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019” that may be applicable in the discussion of the periods described in this section.
Foreign Exchange - Results of Operations
A significant portion of our investments are in foreign currencies. We do not hedge future operations or cash flows and therefore changes in foreign currency rates will have an impact on our results of operations. We have included the table below to illustrate the impact these fluctuations have had on our revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA by applying the applicable exchange rates for the prior period. Please refer to the section titled "Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies" in Item 3 for a discussion of risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy and the section titled "Other Comprehensive Income" below for a discussion of the balance sheet impact of foreign currency movements on our results of operations.
Consolidated Portfolio Segment
Revenues
Rental income was $447.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $514.6 million for 2018. The $67.2 million decrease is primarily due to the AXA Transactions described above. As the assets are now treated as unconsolidated investments (with our ownership percentage remaining the same with respect to certain assets and our ownership percentage dropping with respect to certain assets), our share of rental revenues is part of income from unconsolidated investments in the current period and is no longer treated as consolidated rental revenue. We have also been a net seller of assets during the current and prior periods which has led to a decrease in rental income.
Hotel income was $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $155.7 million for 2018. The $75.2 million decrease is primarily due to the sale of the Ritz Carlton, Lake Tahoe hotel during the first quarter of 2019 and the sale of the Portmarnock and Fairmont St Andrews during the fourth quarter of 2019. We also sold six Park Inn hotels located in the United Kingdom during the fourth quarter of 2018 and an extensive value add renovation of the lobby and reception at the Shelbourne hotel led to lower occupancy rates at the hotel during the first quarter of 2019.
There was minimal activity for the sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $56.8 million for the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized the sale of real estate of 200 Capital Dock, a 130,000 sq. ft. office building under development in Dublin, Ireland, as a result of the construction progress on the building. The 200 Capital Dock project was accounted under percentage of completion and therefore variation in periods is due to the project achieving different milestones in its development timeline. We completed the construction of the building during the first quarter of 2019.
Expenses
Rental expenses decreased to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $160.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the AXA Transactions. As the assets are now treated as unconsolidated investments (with our ownership percentage remaining the same with respect to certain assets and our ownership percentage dropping with respect to certain assets), our share of rental expenses is part of income from unconsolidated investments in the current period and is no longer treated as consolidated rental expense. We have also been a net seller of assets during the current and prior period which has led to a decrease in rental expense.
Hotel expenses decreased to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $121.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the sale of the Ritz Carlton, Lake Tahoe hotel during the first quarter of 2019 and the sale of the Portmarnock and Fairmont St Andrews during the fourth quarter of 2019. We also sold six Park Inn hotels located in the United Kingdom during the fourth quarter of 2018.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized minimal additional costs to complete 200 Capital Dock. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $52.5 million in sale-related costs on 200 Capital Dock.
Compensation expense increased to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to one-time incentive payments during the prior period.
General expenses decreased to $26.3 million for year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to higher travel-related expenses and charitable contributions in our European businesses in the prior year.
Depreciation and amortization decreased by $18.5 million primarily due to the AXA Transactions and the Company being a net seller of assets in 2018 and 2019.
Other
Gains on sale of real estate, net were $434.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $371.8 million in the prior period. The gains recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to the 2019 AXA Transactions, the sale of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, Lake Tahoe and smaller, non-core retail assets in the Western United States and non-core commercial properties in the United Kingdom. Gains on sale of real estate in 2018 primarily to the 2018 AXA Transactions and the ordinary course sales of certain multifamily and office assets located in the Western United States, Ireland, United Kingdom and Italy. Such gains were offset by an impairment loss on a vacated office building in the United Kingdom which was subsequently sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Interest expense was $215.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $238.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is due to the AXA Transactions, the net sale of properties which were encumbered by mortgage debt and increased capitalized interest relating to our development properties.
Transaction-related expenses were $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2018. The increase is due to expenses incurred investigating potential transactions that ultimately were not consummated.
We had net income of $94.4 million attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $62.1 million attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interest is due to the allocation of gains associated with the sale of Ritz Carlton, Lake Tahoe hotel and the 2019 AXA Transactions to our equity partners.
Co-Investment Portfolio Segment
Investment Management
On our Co-Investment Portfolio assets, we receive asset management fees for managing assets on behalf of our partners. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had fees recorded through revenues of $24.9 million which was an increase from fees of $15.4 million for the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we had higher base management fees as a result of having more assets under management in our Co-Investment platform mainly from the AXA joint venture and higher acquisition related fees that we received from equity partners compared to the prior period. These fees are recorded as a component of investment management, property services and research fees. Performance fees are recorded as part of income from unconsolidated investments and discussed below.
Expenses decreased to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $28.0 million primarily due to lower discretionary compensation expense.
Co-investment operations
In addition to our management of investment in the Co-Investment Portfolio we also hold have ownership interests in the properties. The table below represents a breakout of the amounts within income from unconsolidated investments which represents our share of underlying property investments in the Co-Investment Portfolio assets and any performance fees relating to our management of these properties for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018:
Our share of JV NOI (rental income net of rental operating expenses) increased in the current period due to the sale of interests in previously consolidated properties resulting in moving the recognition of income from these assets from our Consolidated Portfolio to our Co-Investment Portfolio as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had gains on sale of real estate of $53.5 million primarily relating to the sale of two multifamily properties in the Western United States which was offset by an impairment of $10.3 million on a residential development in the Western United States that was subsequently sold in the first quarter of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had higher fair value gains on VHH due to resyndications and improved property performance on the underlying investments within VHH.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, income from unconsolidated investments was primarily related to operating distributions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized fair value gains primarily to resyndications under our VHH partnership and improved property performance by its fair value option investments and investments held within the commingled funds managed by the Company.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $36.2 million increase in the accrual for performance fees relating to our commingled funds. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we also recorded an increase in the accrual for performance fees related to the increase in the underlying fair value of assets held by Fund V, Fund VI and the AXA Joint Venture. We also had approximately $12 million in promote fees from a portfolio of multifamily assets held at fair value in a Las Vegas held in a separate account platform that sold in the fourth quarter of 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we recorded performance fees relating to Fund V.
Corporate
Real estate related services fees decreased slightly to $16.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $16.9 million for December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower property management fees from fewer assets under management. We sold Meyers Research in the fourth quarter of 2018 which resulted in the loss of research fees. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we earned $15.1 million of research fees.
Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased to $80.0 million as compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to lower compensation and general and administrative expenses as a result of the sale of the Meyers Research, which reduced our employee headcount by 140 people period-over-period.
Interest expense was $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $77.2 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease is due to the prior period having a higher corporate debt balance due to the term loan still being outstanding.
Gain on sale of business of $40.4 million during year ended December 31, 2018 is related to our sale of Meyers Research.
Other expense was $0.4 million for year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to other income of $13.1 million for the same period in 2018. The income during the year ended December 31, 2018 relates to realized gains on non-designated currency hedging derivative investments on the Euro.
Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for 2019 was $41.4 million and 11.4% as compared to an income tax expense of $58.0 million and a 21.5% effective tax rate in 2018. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily as a result of higher income attributable to non-controlling interests in non-taxable entities, which is not subject to corporate tax, a tax benefit relating to remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability to a lower state effective tax rate and lower tax gains on sales of real estate by KWE.
Preferred dividends and accretion on preferred stock issuance costs were $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 with no comparable activity for the prior period. The Company issued 300,000 shares of its 5.75% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), for gross proceeds of $300 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Other Comprehensive Income
The two major components that drive the change in other comprehensive income are the changes in foreign currency rates and the gains or loss of any associated foreign currency hedges. Please refer to the section titled "Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies" in Item 3 for a discussion of our risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy. Below is a table that details the activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Included within the net income attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders are realized foreign exchange amounts relating to translation of cash amounts held in different functional currencies of the subsidiary that holds it and realized gains and losses on derivative investments that are not treated as net investment hedges. The table below represents the amount of foreign exchange movements recorded to the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
The main currencies that the Company has exposure to are the euro and pound sterling. The table below represents the change in rates over the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 as compared to the U.S. Dollar:
Comprehensive income, net of taxes and noncontrolling interests, for year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was income of $248.6 million and $135.6 million, respectively. The Company experienced net unrealized losses on foreign currency through other comprehensive income for the period due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro offset by U.S. dollar weakening against GBP. Unrealized hedge gains were driven by hedges that KWE holds on its euro denominated investments which were offset by hedges that the Company has on its GBP denominated investments. The unrealized hedge gains on KWE primarily related to cross currency swap and KWE Notes due to the euro weakening against the GBP which led to unrealized gains of $56.0 million. The translation of the cross currency swap and KWE Notes from GBP to U.S. dollars
resulted in an unrealized $12.4 million foreign currency translation loss. See Foreign Currency in Item 1. Business section for more detail on the foreign currency impact of these instruments.
The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to swap some of its variable rate mortgage loans to fixed rate terms. The Company recognized $5.8 million of interest expense savings that were recorded to the statement of operations relating to interest savings on interest rate swaps and forward point amortization on hedge contracts.
Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income are for amounts associated with the AXA joint venture that are moved out of other comprehensive income and recognized on the consolidated statements of income.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity and capital resources requirements include acquisitions of real estate and real estate related assets, funding development projects, capital expenditures for consolidated real estate and unconsolidated investments, working capital needs, interest and principal payments on our debt and dividends to our common and preferred shareholders. We finance these activities with internally generated funds through general operations including rental income, asset sales, borrowings under our revolving line of credit, sales of equity and debt securities and cash out refinancings to the extent they are available and fit within our overall portfolio leverage strategy. Our investments in real estate are typically financed with equity from our balance sheet, third party equity and mortgage loans secured by that real estate. These mortgage loans are generally nonrecourse in that, in the event of default, recourse will be limited to the mortgaged property serving as collateral, subject to limited customary exceptions. In some cases, we guarantee a portion of the loan related to a consolidated property or an unconsolidated investment, usually until some condition, such as completion of construction or leasing or certain net operating income criteria, has been met. We do not expect these guarantees to materially affect liquidity or capital resources. Please refer to the section titled "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" for further information.
Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, dividend payments to our common and preferred shareholders, interest on our unsecured corporate debt, development, redevelopment and capital expenditures and, potentially, share repurchases and acquisitions. We currently expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash and cash equivalents plus capital generated from our investments, sales of real estate as well as availability on our current revolving lines of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we and our consolidated subsidiaries had approximately $965.1 million ($640.3 million of which is in foreign currencies of GBP or EUR) of consolidated cash (as shown on our consolidated balance sheet), our share of cash held at unconsolidated Co-Investment Portfolio assets of $77.3 million and had $300.0 million of availability under lines of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we have $101.7 million of restricted cash, which is included in cash and cash equivalents, that primarily relates to lender reserves associated with consolidated mortgages that we hold on properties. These reserves typically relate to interest, tax, insurance and future capital expenditures at the properties.
Additionally, we are subject to withholding taxes to the extent we repatriate cash from certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Under the KWE Bonds and KWE Notes covenants, we have to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios to remain in compliance (see "Indebtedness and Related Covenants" for more detail on KWE Bonds and KWE Notes). Due to these covenants, we evaluate the tax and covenant implications before we distribute cash, which could impact the availability of funds at the corporate level. During the second quarter of 2020, we contributed $56.4 million to KWE which holds the KWE Bonds and KWE Notes in order ensure that we maintain headroom on certain covenants associated with the KWE Bonds and KWE Notes. This amount is included within the $640.3 million of foreign cash mentioned above and is allowed to be used by KWE and other wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries within KWE for certain permitted investments.
As discussed throughout this report, COVID-19 pandemic could potentially have a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources depending on the duration for which the pandemic lasts and its effect on the global economy. Despite these uncertainties we believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our business operations during the currently foreseeable term of the COVID-19 pandemic through:
•Consolidated cash of $965.1 million as of December 31, 2020
•$300.0 million available under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020
•Minimal debt maturities in 2021, which currently are $123.7 million for our consolidated debt obligations and our share of debt maturities within our Co-Investment portfolio representing less than 2% of our total debt obligations
•Rent collections of 96% across our global investment portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2020 rents as of February 18, 2021
•Subsequent to December 31, 2020 we refinanced $1 billion worth of our 2024 Notes with $500.0 million 2029 Notes and $500.0 million 2031 Notes and lowered interest rate from 5.875% to 4.875%. We also repaid $100.0 million on our revolving credit facility and now have $400.0 million available to draw.
Our need to raise funds from time to time to meet our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success and pace of the implementation of our strategy for strategic and accretive growth where appropriate. Additionally, we may opportunistically seek to raise capital (equity or debt) when we believe market conditions are favorable and when consistent with our growth and financing strategies. We may also seek third party financing to the extent that we engage in additional strategic investments, including capital necessary to execute potential development or redevelopment strategies or acquisition of real estate, note portfolios, or other real estate related companies or real estate related securities. Similarly, as we recently did with our 2024 Notes, we may from time to time seek to refinance our existing indebtedness opportunistically in order to reduce our overall cost of debt capital or optimize the maturity schedule of our outstanding indebtedness, or for other strategic reasons. Please also see the section titled “COVID-19 Impact” above and Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors.
Development and redevelopment
Kennedy Wilson has a number of market rate development, redevelopment and entitlement projects that are underway or are in the planning stages. These initiatives, if completed, will result in market-rate income producing assets. As of December 31, 2020 we have 1,529 multifamily units, 0.6 million commercial rentable square feet and 150 hotel rooms we are actively developing. If these projects were brought to completion the estimated share of the Company's total cost would be approximately $1.1 billion, which we expect would be funded through our existing equity, third party equity, project sales and secured debt financing. This represents total capital over the life of the projects and is not a representation of peak equity and does not take into account any distributions over the course of the investment. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred $395.0 million of costs to date and expect to spend an additional $696.0 million to develop to completion or complete the entitlement process on these projects. Of the $696.0 million of remaining costs to complete we currently expect $334.0 million of it to be funded through cash from us over the life of the projects. When development projects are completed they typically move into our unstabilized bucket as they undergo lease up post-completion. Clancy Quay Phase 3, which was completed in the second quarter of 2020, is now included as part of our unstabilized portfolio and is expected to be stabilized during 2021.
In addition to the market rate development and redevelopment projects described above, we have 1,965 affordable and/or age-restricted multifamily units within our VHH platform that we are currently developing or in the process of stabilizing. We expect to have no cash equity basis in these projects at completion due to the use of property level debt and proceeds from the sale of tax credits. If these projects are brought to completion we expect to receive $21.9 million in cash from paid developer fees and proceeds from the sale of tax credits.
The figures described in the two preceding paragraphs and in the table below are budgeted costs and are subject to change. There is no certainty that the Company will develop or redevelop any or all of these potential projects and the Company and its equity partners are under no obligation to complete these projects and may dispose of any such assets after adding value through the entitlement process. As these are budgeted figures and are subject to change (increase or decrease) due to a number of factors (some of which are beyond our control), including, that these projects are being developed under construction management contracts with the general contractors and therefore we and our equity partners could be called upon to contribute additional capital in the event that actual costs exceed budgeted costs. The scope of these projects may also change. The estimated costs and amounts of cash to complete projects reflected in the table below represent management's current expectations and the total costs incurred to date include the land costs of these projects.
The table below describes the market rate development or redevelopment projects that the Company is undergoing or considering, and excludes the affordable and/or age-restricted multifamily units that it is developing in its VHH platform and its residential investments.
(1) The actual completion date for projects is subject to several factors, many of which are not within our control. Accordingly, the projects identified may not be completed when expected, or at all.
(2) Figures shown in this column are an estimate of our remaining costs to develop to completion or to complete the entitlement process, as applicable, as of December 31, 2020. Total remaining costs may be financed with third-party cash contributions, proceeds from projected sales, and/or debt financing. We expect to fund $334 million of our share of remaining costs to complete with cash over the life of these projects. These figures are budgeted costs and are subject to change. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure the project-level debt financing that is assumed in the figures above. If we are unable to secure such financing, the amount of capital we will have to invest to complete the projects above may significantly increase. Our cost to complete differs from our share total capitalization as the latter includes costs that have already been incurred to date while the former relates to future estimated costs

Unstabilized and Value Add Capital Expenditure Programs
We currently have 13 assets that comprise 1.3 million commercial square feet and 576 multifamily units that are currently unstabilized and are undergoing various stages of lease-up, value-add or development. In order to stabilize these assets we project our share of costs to complete to be $38.9 million. The cost to complete this work and the time frame described is subject to many uncertainties that are beyond our control, and the actual costs may be significantly higher than the estimates shown below.
The table below describes assets that are currently unstabilized:
Note: The table above excludes fund assets and one asset expected to sell, totaling 0.6 million commercial sq. ft., and KW Gross Asset Value of $81.4 million.
(1) Figures shown in this column are an estimate of KW's remaining costs to develop to completion or to complete the entitlement process, as applicable, as of December 31, 2020. Total remaining costs may be financed with third-party cash contributions, proceeds from projected sales, and/or debt financing. These figures are budgeted costs and are subject to change. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure the project-level debt financing that is assumed in the figures above. If the Company is unable to secure such financing, the amount of capital that the Company will have to invest to complete the projects above may significantly increase.
(2) Estimated foreign exchange rates are €0.82 = $1 USD and £0.73 = $1 USD, related to NOI.
In addition to our development, redevelopment and stabilization initiatives, we regularly implement a value-add approach to our consolidated and unconsolidated investments, which includes rehabbing properties and adding or updating property amenities. The capital required to implement these value-add initiatives is typically funded with capital calls, refinancing or supplemental financings at the property level. We are not required to make these investments, but they are a key driver in our ability to increase net operating income at our properties post acquisition.
Liquidating Residential Development Projects
We have liquidating residential development projects primarily in Hawaii and the Western United States where we and our equity partners are developing single family homes and condos that will be sold. We expect to incur approximately $375.8 million in construction costs over the life of these projects, which will be funded by cash from us, cash received from selling the homes and condos, third party equity or debt financing.
Share Repurchase Plan
On March 20, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company’s common stock. On November 3, 2020, the Company's board of directors authorized an expansion of its existing $250 million share repurchase plan to $500 million. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through the net settlement of the Company’s restricted stock grants or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases dependent on market conditions and subject to the company’s discretion. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and, subject to compliance with applicable laws, may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2020, we had $256.7 million remaining under the plan for stock repurchases. Please see the section titled "Purchases of Equity Securities by the Company" in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes the cash provided by or used in our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Operating
Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon operations from consolidated properties, the operating distributions and fees from our Co-Investment Platform, general and administrative costs, compensation and interest expense payments. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, substantially all of the cash flows used by operations of $12.6 million and $19.5 million and cash flow from operations $93.1 million, respectively, were generated from rental collections from consolidated assets and operating distributions from Co-Investments. The fluctuations in cash flow from operations has been driven by the timing and amounts of discretionary compensation.
We have experienced a decline in cash flows from rental properties as we have been a net seller of consolidated assets and used those proceeds to fund development initiatives and value add capital expenditures which has also led to a temporary decrease in operating cash flows. At the same time, we have been growing our third party fee bearing capital which has shifted to more assets in our Co-Investment portfolio. Going forward with the completion of construction, stabilization of development assets and greater fee bearing capital we should have increases in our cash flow from operations.
Investing
Our cash flows from investing activities are generally comprised of cash used to fund property acquisitions, investments in unconsolidated investments, capital expenditures, purchases of loans secured by real estate, as well as cash received from property sales and return of capital from our co-investments.
Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $590.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the current period we spent $70.1 million on acquisitions of consolidated real estate and $194.1 million on capital expenditures on consolidated assets, as well as continued investments in our development properties and value add properties. We received $827.8 million from the sale of industrial assets in the United Kingdom to the Industrial JV, Baggot Plaza in Dublin, Club Palisades multifamily property in the Western United States and non-core assets in Europe. Issuance of new loan investments were $88.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as our debt platform has grown during the year. We had $34.1 million of collections on loans primarily from the sale of a loan in Dublin secured by a multifamily property. We received $177.5 million in investing distributions from our co-investments primarily from the sale of an additional 30% interest of three multifamily properties to AXA as part of our separate account platform. We also contributed $111.6 million to unconsolidated investments that were primarily used to fund our share of capital calls on our commingled funds and investments undergoing development. The settlement of foreign currency derivatives netted $15.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $210.9 million on acquisitions of consolidated real estate and $191.1 million on capital expenditures on consolidated assets, our development properties and value add properties. We received $701.0 million from the sale of Ritz Carlton Lake Tahoe, Fairmont and Portmarnock hotels and non-core retail and commercial properties in the Western United States and United Kingdom. We also contributed $266.0 million to unconsolidated investments which mainly related to multifamily and office properties in the Western United States and United Kingdom and capital calls associated with development projects in Dublin, Ireland. We received $115.0 million from distributions on unconsolidated investments from sales of multifamily assets in Western United States and refinancings and resyndications within our VHH portfolio.
Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $593.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had $571.8 million of purchases and additions to real estate primarily for additions to real estate in our Mountain States multifamily portfolio and a multifamily property in Cork, Ireland and $396.1 million contributions to unconsolidated investments which mainly related to our new AXA joint venture platform and to fund new investments and capital expenditures which included acquisitions in Fund VI. The cash used in the aforementioned investing activities was offset by receipt of $1,386.1 million, mainly from sales of multifamily properties in the Western United States (which were then tax deferred and exchanged into higher quality multifamily properties in the Western United States), non-core commercial properties in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy as well as assets into the AXA joint venture platform. On our Capital Dock development, we spent $29.1 million and received $81.0 million for reaching completion milestones. We received $63.7 million in investing distributions on unconsolidated investments primarily relating to resyndications in our VHH portfolio and property sales. The sale of our research subsidiary, Meyers Research, generated $43.4 million in proceeds. We also received $7.4 million from the liquidation of our marketable securities portfolio.
Financing
Our net cash related to financing activities is generally impacted by capital-raising activities net of dividends and distributions paid to common and preferred shareholders and noncontrolling interests as well as financing activities for consolidated real estate investments. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $206.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We received proceeds of $296.4 million from mortgage loans to finance property acquisitions and to refinance existing investments, which were offset by the repayment of $487.1 million of investment debt mainly driven by repayment of mortgages on sold consolidated properties. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we borrowed $200.0 million on our credit facility. Distributions of $18.9 million were paid to noncontrolling interest holders primarily as a result of asset sales and cash received from financings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $126.1 million of dividends to our common stockholders and $13.6 million of dividends to our preferred shareholders. We also returned $57.4 million to shareholders through share repurchases as part of our share repurchase plan discussed above.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We received proceeds of $295.2 million from the issuance of Preferred Stock and $488.6 million from mortgage loans to finance and refinance consolidated property acquisitions, which were offset by the repayment of $391.4 million of investment debt mainly driven by repayment of mortgages on sold consolidated properties. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we borrowed $125.0 million on our credit facility and repaid $200.0 million (as of December 31, 2019 our credit facility is undrawn). Distributions of $264.0 million were paid to noncontrolling interest holders primarily as a result of asset sales and cash received from financings. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $114.9 million of dividends to our common stockholders and $2.6 million of dividends to our preferred shareholders. We also returned $20.7 million to shareholders through share repurchases as part of our share repurchase plan discussed above.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $528.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We received proceeds of $246.6 million from the issuance of additional 2024 Notes and $725.0 million from mortgage loans to finance and refinance consolidated property acquisitions, which were offset by the repayment of $866.8 million of investment debt mainly driven by repayment of mortgages on sold consolidated properties.

Distributions of $116.0 million were paid to noncontrolling interest holders primarily as a result of asset sales and cash received from financings. During the year December 31, 2018, we paid dividends to our common stockholders of $111.2 million which is an increase over prior periods due to an increase in share count as part of the KWE Transaction as well as an increase in the dividend per share amount as compared to prior periods. We also returned $177.9 million to shareholders through share repurchases as part of our share repurchase plan discussed above.

Indebtedness and Related Covenants
The following describes certain indebtedness and related covenants.
Senior Notes Payable
In March 2014, Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. (“KWI”), completed a public offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), for approximately $290.7 million, net of discount and estimated offering expenses. The 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 25, 2014, by and among Kennedy-Wilson, Inc., as issuer, and Wilmington Trust National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated as of March 25, 2014, by and between Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. as issuer, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc., as parent guarantor, certain subsidiaries of the issuer, as subsidiary guarantors, and Wilmington Trust National Association, as trustee (the indenture, as so supplemented, the “2024 Indenture”). The issuer's obligations under the 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors. At any time prior to April 1, 2019, the issuer may redeem the 2024 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus an applicable “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after April 1, 2019, the issuer may redeem the 2024 Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption price
specified in the 2024 Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Interest on the 2024 Notes accrues at a rate of 5.875% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2014. The 2024 Notes will mature on April 1, 2024. In November 2014, August 2016 and March 2018, we completed additional public offerings of $350 million, $250 million and $250 million, respectively, aggregate principal amounts of 5.875% Senior Notes, due 2024 (the “Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes have substantially identical terms as the 2024 Notes described above, and are treated as a single series with the 2024 Notes under such 2024 Indenture. The Additional Notes were issued and sold at public offering prices of 100.0% in November 2014, 100.0% in August 2016 and 98.625% in March 2018 of their principal amount, plus accrued interest. The amount of the 2024 Notes included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased a total of approximately $577 million of the 2024 Notes through a tender offer using a portion of the proceeds from the 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes as described below. The Company announced that it would redeem an additional $373 million of the 2024 Notes with the remaining proceeds from the 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes and cash on its balance sheet.
In February 2021, KWI, completed a public offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes,” and together with the 2029 Notes, the “Notes,” and together with the 2024 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the “KWI Notes”). The Notes were issued pursuant to a base indenture, dated as of March 25, 2014, between KWI and the Trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture for each series of Notes (each, a “Supplemental Indenture,” and each Supplemental Indenture, together with the Base Indenture, an “Indenture”), dated as of February 11, 2021, among KWI, the guarantors (including Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc.) and the Trustee. KWI’s obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc., and the subsidiary guarantors. At any time prior to March 1, 2024 (in the case of the 2029 Notes) or March 1, 2026 (in the case of the 2031 Notes), KWI may redeem the Notes of either series, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus an applicable “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after March 1, 2024 (in the case of the 2029 Notes) or March 1, 2026 (in the case of the 2031 Notes), KWI may redeem the Notes of either series, in whole or in part, at redemption prices specified in the applicable Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 4.750% per annum (in the case of the 2029 Notes) or 5.000% (in the case of the 2031 Notes) and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year commencing on September 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on March 1, 2029 (in the case of the 2029 Notes) or March 1, 2031 (in the case of the 2031 Notes), unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company announced that it intends to use the proceeds from the Notes to repurchase or redeem a total of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes.
KWE Senior Notes Payable
KWE has bonds outstanding ("KWE Bonds") of approximately $504.7 million (based on December 31, 2020 rates) (£369.8 million) in 3.95% fixed-rate senior unsecured bonds due 2022. KWE effectively reduced the interest rate to 3.35% as a result of it entering into swap arrangements to convert 50% of the proceeds into Euros. On October 7, 2020, KWE launched a cash tender offer to repurchase a portion of the outstanding balance of the KWE Bonds (the "Tender Offer"). KWE purchased £130.2 million ($177.7 million based on December 31, 2020 rates) in aggregate nominal amount of the KWE Bonds, or 26.04% of the £500.0 million aggregate nominal amount of the KWE Bonds outstanding in Tender Offer. The purchase price for the KWE Bonds validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer was a price equal to 101% of the nominal amount of the relevant KWE Bonds, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, October 22, 2020. The total Tender Offer consideration was £133.1 million, including accrued and unpaid interest and was settled on October 22, 2020.
KWE also established a £2.0 billion (approximately $2.7 billion based on December 31, 2020 rates) Euro Medium Term Note Programme ("EMTN"). Under the EMTN Programme, KWE may issue, from time to time, up to £2.0 billion of various types of debt securities in certain markets and currencies. KWE has drawn down under its EMTN Programme, with issuances of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $672.4 million (based on December 31, 2020 rates) (€550 million) (the "KWE Notes"). The KWE Notes were issued at a discount and have a carrying value of $669.7 million, have an annual fixed coupon of 3.25%, and mature in 2025. The KWE Notes rank pari passu with the KWE Bonds, and are subject to the same restrictive covenants.
Borrowings Under Line of Credit
Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. (the “Borrower”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), KWH and certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) on March 25, 2020 extended its existing $500 million revolving line of credit ("Second A&R Facility"). Loans under the Second A&R Facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus between 1.75% and 2.50%, depending on the consolidated leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. The Second A&R Facility has a maturity date of March 25, 2024. Subject to certain conditions precedent
and at Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.’s (the "Borrower") option, the maturity date of the Second A&R Facility may be extended by one year.
The Company has $200.0 million outstanding on the A&R Facility on December 31, 2020 with $300.0 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company repaid $100.0 million on our revolving credit facility and now have $400.0 million available to draw.
Debt Covenants
The Second A&R Facility and the indentures governing the KWI Notes contain numerous restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit Kennedy Wilson's and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions to stockholders, repurchase capital stock or debt, make investments, sell assets or subsidiary stock, create or permit liens on assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, issue subsidiary equity and enter into consolidations or mergers. The Second A&R Revolving Facility requires Kennedy Wilson to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and a specified amount of cash and cash equivalents.
The Second A&R Facility has certain covenants as defined within its Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 25, 2020 (the "Credit Agreement") that, among other things, limit the Company and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase capital stock or debt, sell assets or subsidiary stock, create or permit liens, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, issue subsidiary equity and enter into consolidations or mergers. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain (i) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 65%, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (ii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.70 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the period of four full fiscal quarters then ended, (iii) a minimum consolidated tangible net worth equal to or greater than the sum of $1,700,000,000 plus an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of net equity proceeds received by the Company after the date of the most recent financial statements that are available as of the March 25, 2020, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iv) a maximum recourse leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than an amount equal to consolidated tangible net worth as of the measurement date multiplied by 1.5, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (v) a maximum secured recourse leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than an amount equal to 3.5% of consolidated total asset value (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and $299,000,000, (vi) a maximum adjusted secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 55%, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, and (vii) liquidity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of at least $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
The indentures governing the KWI Notes limit the ability of Kennedy Wilson and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness if, on the date of such incurrence and after giving effect to the new indebtedness, the maximum balance sheet leverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) is greater than 1.50 to 1.00. This ratio is measured at the time of incurrence of additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
The KWE Bonds and KWE Notes require KWE to maintain (i) consolidated net indebtedness (as defined in the trust deed for the notes) of no more than 60% of the total asset value; (ii) consolidated secured indebtedness (less cash and cash equivalents) of no more than 50% of total asset value; (iii) an interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0, and (iv) unencumbered assets of no less than 125% of the unsecured indebtedness (less cash & cash equivalents). The covenants associated with KWE Bonds and KWE Notes are not an obligation of KWH and these amounts are presented as a component of our investment debt as it is an unsecured obligation relating to an underlying investment of ours. During the second quarter of 2020, we contributed $56.4 million to KWE which holds the KWE Bonds and KWE Notes in order ensure that we maintain headroom on covenants associated with the KWE Bonds and KWE Notes. This amount is included within the $640.3 million of foreign cash and is allowed to be used by KWE and other wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries within KWE for certain permitted investments. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
In addition, loan agreements that govern the Company's property-level non-recourse financings that are secured by its properties may contain operational and financial covenants, including but not limited to, debt yield related covenants and debt service coverage ratio covenants and, with respect to mortgages secured by certain properties in Europe, loan-to-value ratio covenants. Property-level non-recourse financings with such loan-to-value covenants require that the underlying properties are valued on a periodic basis (at least annually). The failure by the Company to comply with such covenants and/or secure waivers from lenders could result in defaults under these instruments. In addition, if the Company defaults under a mortgage loan and/or such loan is accelerated by the lender, it may automatically be in default under any of its property and corporate unsecured loans that contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions. Please also see Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors. As of December 31, 2020, the Company received waivers on certain debt covenants in loan agreements governing a total of $266.9 million or 10% of our consolidated mortgage balance. These mortgages are secured by certain retail and hospitality assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland. All of these loans are non-recourse to the Company and the waivers are through
March 31, 2021 and beyond and typically cover interest coverage and loan-to-value covenants. The Company expects to be in compliance with these covenants subsequent to December 31, 2020, or will seek additional waivers and/or extensions as, and if needed. In the event the Company is required to seek such additional waivers and/or extensions, the Company is currently confident that it will be able to secure the same. We also received covenant waivers on $169.8 million of mortgages within our Co-Investment portfolio (our share of which is $58.0 million and our equity in the properties securing the mortgage is $14.3 million). The Company is current on all payments (principal and interest) for its property-level mortgages including the loans discussed above.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with or had received waivers on property-level mortgages on all covenant calculations after taking into consideration the waivers discussed above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Guarantees
We have provided guarantees associated with loans secured by consolidated assets. At December 31, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) we could be required to make under the guarantees was approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2020. The guarantees expire through 2025 and our performance under the guarantees would be required to the extent there is a shortfall in liquidation between the principal amount of the loan and the net sale proceeds of the applicable properties. If we were to become obligated to perform on these guarantees, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
As of December 31, 2020, we have unfulfilled capital commitments totaling $97.4 million to our unconsolidated investments. In addition to the unfunded capital commitments on its joint venture investments, the Company has $155.9 million of equity commitments relating on consolidated and unconsolidated development projects. As we identify investment opportunities in the future, we may be called upon to contribute additional capital to unconsolidated investments in satisfaction of our capital commitment obligations.
Non-Recourse Carve Out Guarantees
Most of our real estate properties within our equity partnerships are encumbered by traditional non-recourse debt obligations. In connection with most of these loans, however, we entered into certain “non-recourse carve out” guarantees, which provide for the loans to become partially or fully recourse against us if certain triggering events occur. Although these events are different for each guarantee, some of the common events include:
•the special purpose property-owning subsidiary’s filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy;
•the special purpose property-owning subsidiary’s failure to maintain its status as a special purpose entity; and
•subject to certain conditions, the special purpose property-owning subsidiary’s failure to obtain lender’s written consent prior to any subordinate financing or other voluntary lien encumbering the associated property.
In the event that any of these triggering events occur and the loans become partially or fully recourse against us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and common stock price could be materially adversely affected.
In addition, other items that are customarily recourse to a non-recourse carve out guarantor include, but are not limited to, the payment of real property taxes, liens which are senior to the mortgage loan and outstanding security deposits.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of operations of our company in recent years.
Our exposure to market risk from changing prices consists primarily of fluctuations in rental rates of commercial and multifamily properties, market interest rates on investment mortgages and debt obligations and real estate property values. Rental rate increases are dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environments in the respective locations of the properties. To the extent that we engage in development activities, we may have exposure to changing prices in materials or cost of labor. The revenues of the investment management operations with respect to rental properties are highly dependent upon the aggregate rents of the properties managed, which are affected by rental rates and building occupancy rates. Employee compensation is the principal cost element of investment management.
Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in connection with our short-term borrowings, some of which bear interest at variable rates based on the lender’s base rate, prime rate, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or LIBOR plus an applicable borrowing margin. These borrowings do not give rise to a significant interest rate risk because they have
short maturities. However, the amount of income or loss we recognize for unconsolidated joint ventures or consolidated interest expense from property level debt may be impacted by changes in interest rates. Our exposure to market risk also consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations.

We have established an interest rate management policy, which attempts to minimize our overall cost of debt while taking into consideration the earnings implications associated with the volatility of short-term interest rates. As part of this policy, we have elected to maintain a combination of variable and fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2020, 83% of our consolidated debt is fixed rate, 6% is floating rate with interest caps and 11% is floating rate without interest caps.
We hold variable rate debt on some of our consolidated properties that are subject to interest rate fluctuations. In order to mitigate some of the risk associated with increasing interest rates we have purchased interest rate caps that limit the amount that interest expense can increase with rate increases. However, some of our debt is uncapped and the mortgages that do have interest caps are subject to increased interest expense until rates hit the level of caps that have been purchased. If there was a 100-basis point increase or decrease, we would have a $22.4 million increase in interest expense or $2.8 million in interest expense savings during 2020 on our current consolidated mortgages. The weighted average strike price on caps and maturity of Kennedy Wilson’s variable rate mortgages is 1.66% and approximately 2.3 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
The table below represents contractual balances of our financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair value as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average interest rate for the various assets and liabilities presented are actual as of December 31, 2020. We closely monitor the fluctuation in interest rates, and if rates were to increase significantly, we believe that we would be able to either hedge the change in the interest rate or refinance the loans with fixed interest rate debt. All instruments included in this analysis are non-trading.
(1) Interest rate sensitive assets' weighted average interest rates are exclusive of non-performing receivables.
Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies
The financial statements of Kennedy Wilson's subsidiaries located outside the United States are measured using the local currency as this is their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate. The foreign currencies include the euro and the British pound sterling. Cumulative translation adjustments, to the extent not included in cumulative net income, are included in the consolidated statement of equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Currency translation gains and losses and currency derivative gains and losses will remain in other comprehensive income unless and until the Company substantially liquidates underlying investments.
Approximately 46% of our investment account is invested through our foreign platforms in their local currencies. Investment level debt is generally incurred in local currencies and therefore we consider our equity investment as the appropriate exposure to evaluate for hedging purposes. Additionally, the costs to operate these businesses, such as
compensation, overhead and interest expense are incurred in local currencies. We typically do not hedge future operations or cash flows of operations denominated in foreign currencies, which may have a significant impact on the results of our operations for both the investment and services segments. In order to manage the effect of these fluctuations, we generally hedge our book equity exposure to foreign currencies through currency forward contracts and options. As of December 31, 2020 we have hedged 95% of the gross asset carrying value of our euro denominated investments and 87% of the gross asset carrying value of our GBP denominated investments.
Our service businesses typically do not require much capital, so foreign currency translation and derivative activity primarily relates to the investments segment as that has greater balance sheet exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
If there was a 5% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates on the currencies we invest to the U.S. Dollar our net asset value would increase by $17.1 million or decrease by $17.2 million. If rates moved 10% we would have an increase of $34.1 million and a decrease of $34.5 million.

Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Definitions
“KWH,” "KW," “Kennedy Wilson,” the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" refers to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the results of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries.
“KWE” refers to Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Limited (formerly known as Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate plc), which was a London Stock Exchange-listed company that we externally managed through a wholly-owned subsidiary. On October 20, 2017 we acquired KWE, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary.
“Adjusted EBITDA” represents net income before interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, our share of interest expense included in income from investments in unconsolidated investments, depreciation and amortization, our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, our share of taxes included in unconsolidated investments, share-based compensation expense for the Company and EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Please also see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income as reported under GAAP. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze our business because it adjusts net income for items we believe do not accurately reflect the nature of our business going forward or that relate to non-cash compensation expense or noncontrolling interests. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use, as it does not remove all non-cash items (such as non-cash acquisition-related gains or expenses) or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amount shown for Adjusted EBITDA also differs from the amount calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
“Adjusted Net Income” represents net income before depreciation and amortization, our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments, share-based compensation, preferred dividends and accretion of preferred stock issuance costs and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, before depreciation and
amortization. Please also see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net income as reported under GAAP.
“Consolidated Portfolio NOI” refers to the NOI that is generated from the properties that we have an ownership interest in and are held in our Consolidated Properties business segment. Please also see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations” for a reconciliation of Consolidated Portfolio NOI to net income as reported under GAAP.
"Equity partners" refers to non-wholly-owned subsidiaries that we consolidate in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP and third-party equity providers.
"Fee Bearing Capital" represents total third-party committed or invested capital that we manage in our joint-ventures and commingled funds that entitle us to earn fees, including without limitation, asset management fees, construction management fees, acquisition and disposition fees and/or promoted interest, if applicable.
"Gross Asset Value” refers to the gross carrying value of assets, before debt, depreciation and amortization, and net of noncontrolling interests.
"Real Estate Assets under Management" ("AUM") generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, and investments in joint ventures. Our AUM is principally intended to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our AUM consists of the total estimated fair value of the real estate properties and other real estate related assets either owned by third parties, wholly-owned by us or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in our AUM. The estimated value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.
“Co-Investment Portfolio NOI” refers to the NOI that is generated from the properties that we have an ownership interest in and are held in our Co-investment Properties business segment. Please also see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations” for a reconciliation of Co-Investment Portfolio NOI to net income as reported under GAAP.
"Net operating income" or " NOI” is a non-GAAP measure representing the income produced by a property calculated by deducting certain property expenses from property revenues. Our management uses net operating income to assess and compare the performance of our properties and to estimate their fair value. Net operating income does not include the effects of depreciation or amortization or gains or losses from the sale of properties because the effects of those items do not necessarily represent the actual change in the value of our properties resulting from our value-add initiatives or changing market conditions. Our management believes that net operating income reflects the core revenues and costs of operating our properties and is better suited to evaluate trends in occupancy and lease rates.
"Noncontrolling interests" represents the portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to Kennedy Wilson.
“Same property” refers to properties in which Kennedy Wilson has an ownership interest during the entire span of both periods being compared. The same property information presented throughout this report is shown on a cash basis and excludes non-recurring expenses. This analysis excludes properties that are either under development or undergoing lease up as part of our asset management strategy.
We use certain non-GAAP measures to analyze our business, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. We use these metrics for evaluating the success of our company and believe that they enhance the understanding of our operating results. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is presented below:
(1) (2) See "Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Definitions" for definitions and discussion of Adjusted EBITDA.

Net Operating Income
Same property analysis
The same property analysis reflects, and is weighted by, Kennedy Wilson's ownership in each underlying property. Previously, the Company had presented this analysis without adjusting for Kennedy Wilson's ownership interest.
The table below is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures included within the Company's same property analysis, to their most comparable GAAP measures.
(1) Represents rental revenue and rental expenses and hotel revenue and hotel expenses attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2) Represents the Company’s share of unconsolidated investment rental revenues and rental expenses, as applicable, which are within the applicable same property population.
(3) Represents properties excluded from the same property population that were purchased or sold during the applicable period.
(4) Represents properties excluded from the same property population that were not during the applicable period.
(5) Represents other properties excluded from the same property population that were not classified as either a commercial or multifamily property within the Company’s portfolio. Also includes immaterial adjustments for foreign exchange rates, changes in ownership percentages, and certain non-recurring income and expenses.
Critical Accounting Policies
A critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires judgment on the part of management about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and is material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations. Estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, those
presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies. Refer to Note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies.
Performance fees
Performance fees or carried interest are allocated to the general partner, special limited partner or asset manager of Kennedy Wilson's real estate funds and fair value option unconsolidated investments based on the cumulative performance of the fund and are subject to preferred return thresholds of the limited partners and participants. At the end of each reporting period, Kennedy Wilson calculates the performance fee that would be due as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as performance fees to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the performance fee allocated to the general partner or asset manager or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to Kennedy Wilson to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to performance fees allocated to the general partner or asset manager.
Real Estate Acquisitions
The purchase price of acquired properties is recorded to land, buildings and building improvements and intangible lease value (value of above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place lease values, and tenant relationships, if any). The ownership of the other interest holders in consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as noncontrolling interests. Real estate is recorded based on cumulative costs incurred and allocated based on relative fair value.
The valuations of real estate are based on management estimates of the real estate assets using income and market approaches. The indebtedness securing the real estate is valued, in part, based on third party valuations and management estimates also using an income approach.
The indebtedness securing the real estate are valued, in part, based on third party valuations and management estimates also using an income approach. The use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and intangible assets and assumed liabilities could affect the future revenues and expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life or lease term.
Fair Value Investments
Kennedy Wilson records its investments in certain commingled funds it manages and sponsors (the "Funds") that are investment companies under the Investment Companies ASC Subtopic 946-10, based upon the net assets that would be allocated to its interests in the Funds assuming the Funds were to liquidate their investments at fair value as of the reporting date. Thus, the Funds reflect their investments at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in their earnings. Kennedy Wilson has retained the specialized accounting for the Funds as discussed in ASC Subtopic 323-10 in recording its equity in joint venture income from the Funds.
Additionally, Kennedy Wilson elected the fair value option for 29 investments in unconsolidated investment entities. Due to the nature of these investments, Kennedy Wilson elected to record these investments at fair value in order to report the value in the underlying investments in the results of our current operations.
The use of different assumptions to fair value these investments could have material impact on the consolidated statements of income.
