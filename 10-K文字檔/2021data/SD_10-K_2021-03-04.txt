Outlook
As discussed in “Business- Our Business Strategy” in Item 1 of this report, we will focus on maximizing free cash flow in 2021 through a combination of cost control measures and the continued exercise of financial discipline and prudent capital allocation, which includes limiting our drilling capital to locations we believe will provide high rates of return in the current commodity price environment. As a result, our planned capital expenditures for 2021 will be similar to our 2020 levels. Given this expected level of capital expenditures, our oil, natural gas and NGL production will likely decline in 2021. We will be prepared to expand our capital program after considering all factors including commodity prices. We will also continue our pursuit of acquisitions and business combinations which provide high margin properties with attractive returns at current commodity prices.
The COVID-19 pandemic and other pricing volatility caused by the announcement of production increases by Saudi Arabia-led OPEC and Russia caused a steep decline in oil prices in March 2020, which further decreased to historic lows in April 2020. Although we cannot reasonably estimate what the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other market volatility will have on our business, it could have a material, adverse impact on near-term future revenues and overall profitability. Additionally, we have implemented several additional initiatives to maximize free cash flow, reduce our debt level, maximize our liquidity position and, ultimately realize greater shareholder value. These initiatives included personnel and non-personnel cost reductions, the sale of the company headquarters during 2020. Prior to February 5, 2021, we held assets in the North Park Basin, which have been sold in their entirety.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The majority of our consolidated revenues and cash flow are generated from the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices received for our production, the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce, and our ability to find and economically develop and produce our reserves. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and are difficult to predict. To provide information on the general trend in pricing, the average annual NYMEX prices for oil and natural gas for recent years are presented in the table below:
In order to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations, we have historically entered into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production as discussed in
