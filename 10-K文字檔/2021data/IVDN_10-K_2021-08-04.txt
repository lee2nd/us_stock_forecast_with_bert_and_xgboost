Background
Innovative Designs, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the “Company”, “we” or “our”) was formed on June 25, 2002. We market and sell cold weather clothing products called “Arctic Armor” that are, except for our headwear, made from INSULTEX, a material with buoyancy, scent block and thermal resistant properties. We offer our House Wrap product line which is also made from INSULTEX. We obtain INSULTEX for our cold weather clothing products through a license agreement with the owner and manufacturer of the material. In December 2015, we took delivery of equipment capable of producing our own INSULTEX. We are currently seeking a facility where the equipment can be installed. We intend to use the INSULTEX from this equipment in the production of our House Wrap product and for the sale of INSULTEX to others.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, with the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019.
The following table shows a comparison of the results of operations between the fiscal years ended October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019:
Results of Operations
Revenues for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, were $202,253 compared to revenues of $215,975 for the comparable period ending October 31, 2019. House Wrap product revenue totaled $ 131,285 for the period compared to $80,469 for Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2019. Nearly all of the remaining revenues were derived from our Arctic Armor product line which totaled $70.968 for the period compared to revenues of $135,506 for the Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2019. The decrease in revenue is attributable to the FTC matter with regard to our House Wrap products as we did not advertise for this product line during the period. The decrease in revenue for our apparel product line is attributable to the fact that we are devoting significant portion of our limited resources to the FTC matter. Revenues are net of returns and discounts. We estimate that approximately sixty percent of our cold weather apparel products are sold to outdoor sportsmen, primarily those engaged in ice fishing.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased from $577,060 in fiscal year 2019, to $341,132 in the fiscal year ending October 31, 2012. This decrease reflects, in part, a decrease in compensation expense as a result of furloughing two employees in March 2019, and a decrease in professional fees from $ 210,044 in fiscal year 2019, to $71,183 for fiscal year 2020.
Our cost of sales increased from $126,645 as of October 31, 2019 to $131,280 as of October 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, we funded our operations from revenues and private sales of our common stock. We will continue to fund our operations from these sources until we are able to produce sales sufficient to cover our cost structure or to secure commercial lending arrangements.
On July 12, 2015 the Company reached an agreement with Ketut Jaya to purchase machinery and equipment utilized to produce the INSULTEX material. The purchase price is $700,000 and to be made in four installments. The first installment of $300,000 is to be made at the execution of the agreement. The second installment of $200,000 is to be made when the machinery and equipment is ready to be shipped to the United States. The third installment of $100,000 is to be made once the machinery and equipment is producing INSULTEX, and the fourth and final installment of $100,000 is to be made after the first commercial production run of INSULTEX is completed. As of October 31, 2016, the Company has made payments of $600,000. In addition to the final payments, the Company will have to have the equipment and machines installed and ensure that the machine can be operated in compliance with environmental regulations. The Company has not made an estimate of the costs required for bringing the machine into compliance, but it is considered to be substantial. Given the expected time and cost of bringing the equipment into production mode and our current financial condition, it is our intention to attempt to sell the equipment.
Short Term: We funded our operations with revenues from sales, private sales of our common stock and from loans from our Chief Executive Officer and others. We could not access commercial lines of credit during our last fiscal year.

The Company intends to repay these debt obligations with funds it generates from revenues, from the possible sale of its securities either debt or equity, from advances from its CEO or other stockholders. Because we cannot currently access commercial lending facilities, should we not be able to continue to obtain funding from our CEO and/or other individuals or sell our securities or should our revenues decrease our operations would be severely effected as we would not be able to fund our purchase orders to our suppliers for finished goods. The Company continues to pay its creditors when payments are due.
Long Term: The Company will continue to fund operations from revenues, borrowings and the possible sale of its securities. Should we not be able to continue to rely on these sources our operations would be severely effected as we would not be able to fund our purchase orders to our suppliers for finished goods.
Subsequent to the period in December 2020, the Company borrowed $200,000 from an individual. The note is secured by one of the Company’s patent. The term of the loan is three years and the interest rate is 12% per annum. The loan is to be repaid in yearly installments with the first payment of $66,666.00 to be paid on the 180th day from the date of the loan. Thereafter, each installment will be due and payable one year from the date of the loan and each succeeding calendar until three years from the date of the loan year. On April 29, 2021, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principle amount of $50,000. The interest rate is 8% and the note matures in one year. The amount of the note may be converted into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the rate of one share for each $.50 of the outstanding amounts due and owning under the note.
