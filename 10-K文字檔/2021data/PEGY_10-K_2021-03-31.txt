ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Key 2021 Developments
As discussed above under “Proposed Merger with Pineapple Energy,” on March 1, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Helios Merger Co. and Pineapple Energy LLC pursuant to which Pineapple would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, CSI intends to pursue dispositions of its existing assets and businesses prior to the closing of the Merger. To the extent these dispositions occur, CSI expects to declare a cash dividend that distributes a portion of the proceeds from these dispositions to its shareholders as of a pre-closing record date.
Following the Merger closing, CSI will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the dispositions of these assets as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within 18 months of the closing). Proceeds that become available from the dispositions that occur following the closing of the Merger will be distributed pro rata to the legacy shareholders pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement described above. CSI will continue to support these existing business lines as it pursues new owners for these businesses.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we instituted temporary office closures, implemented shelter-in-place orders and restrictions and instituted a mandatory work from home policy for substantially all office employees, and instituted social distancing work rules for operations personnel that continued to work in our facilities to satisfy customer orders. We experienced supply chain and demand disruptions during 2020 and expect the disruption to our supply to continue into 2021, as well as higher logistics and operational costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, we have seen an increase in demand for our fiber and high-speed products as customers are looking to upgrade their networks. As noted below, we also saw delays in orders as some projects are pushed out due to the inability to access locations due to the shutdowns. We may also see a slowdown in our business if one or more of our major customer or suppliers delays its purchase or supplies due to uncertainty in its business operations, encounters difficulties in its production due to employee safety or workforce concerns, is unable to obtain materials or labor from third parties that it needs to complete its projects, and may see a slowdown in our collection of receivables if our customers encounter cash flow difficulties or delay payments to preserve their cash resources. We are continuing to actively monitor the effects and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, liquidity and capital resources. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain at this time.
Forward Looking Statements
In this report and from time to time, in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases, and in other communications to shareholders or the investing public, we may make “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We may make these forward looking statements concerning possible or anticipated future financial performance, business activities, plans, pending claims, investigations or litigation, which are typically preceded by the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends” or similar expressions. For these forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in federal securities laws. Shareholders and the investing public should understand that these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance, activities, anticipated results, outcomes or plans to differ significantly from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of a number of these risk factors, please see Item 1A above.
Critical Accounting Policies
Inventory Valuation: We value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Reserves for excess and obsolescence are estimated and recorded to reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value. The amount of the reserve is determined based on historical usage, projected sales information, plans for discontinued products, and other factors. Though management considers these reserves adequate and proper, changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could materially affect the adequacy of this reserve.
Income Taxes: In the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, management calculates income taxes. This includes estimating the Company’s current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the balance sheet. These assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood it will realize these deferred assets from future taxable income. We determine the valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits based upon the expectation of whether the benefits are more likely than not to be realized. The Company records interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Goodwill Impairment: We are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment can be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value using a quantitative assessment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
For the quantitative assessment, the Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis and a market-based valuation approach based on comparable public company trading values. The Company believes that accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement. Management’s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions, such as earnings growth rate, require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for these goods or services. In the Electronics & Software segment, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the Company’s connectivity infrastructure and data transmission products. To determine when revenue should be recognized, it is important to determine when the transfer of control has occurred. The Company has determined that control transfers for these products upon shipment or delivery to the customer, in accordance with the agreed upon shipping terms. As such, the timing of revenue recognition occurs at a specific point in time.
The Company has determined that the following performance obligations identified in its Services & Support segment are transferred over time: managed services and professional services (time and materials (“T&M”) and fixed price). This segment’s managed services performance obligation is a bundled solution, a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and are recognized evenly over the term of the contract. T&M professional services arrangements are measured over time with an input method based on hours expended towards satisfying this performance obligation. Fixed price professional service arrangements under a relatively longer-term service will also be measured over time with an input method based on hours expended.
The Company has also identified the following performance obligations within its Services & Support segment that are recognized at a point in time which include resale of third-party hardware and software, installation, arranging for another party to transfer services to the customer, and certain professional services. The resale of third-party hardware and software is recognized at a point in time, when the goods are shipped or delivered to the customer’s location, in accordance with the shipping terms. Installation services are recognized at a point in time when the services are completed. The service the Company provides to arrange for another party to transfer services to the customer is satisfied at a point in time as the Company has transferred control upon the service first being made available to the customer by the third-party vendor, which are required to be presented on a net basis. Depending on the nature of the service, certain professional services transfer control at a point in time. The Company evaluates these circumstances on a case by case basis to determine if revenue should be recognized over time or at a point in time.
Results of Operations
2020 Compared to 2019
Consolidated sales were $42,576,000 in 2020, a 16% decrease from sales of $50,906,000 in 2019. Net loss from continuing operations in 2020 was $1,796,000, or ($0.19) per share compared to net income of $251,000 or $0.03 per share in 2019.
Electronics & Software Results
The Electronics & Software segment designs, develops and sells Intelligent Edge solutions that provide connectivity and power through PoE products and actionable intelligence to end devices in an IoT ecosystem through embedded and cloud-based management software. In addition, this segment continues to generate revenue from its traditional products consisting of media converters, NICs, and ethernet switches that offer the ability to affordably integrate the benefits of fiber optics into any data network. Characteristics of this business include a rapid pace of change in technologies and alternative solutions to our products. This segment derives the majority of its revenues from new installations and network upgrade projects, which tend not to recur frequently. The core markets for these products are enterprise, service providers, government, and industrial users. In 2020, 86% of Electronics & Software revenue came from North America, but we continue to see opportunity for long-term growth outside of North America and we continue to invest resources in sales, marketing, and infrastructure to grow that business.
Electronics & Software sales decreased 27% to $34,496,000 in 2020 compared to $47,007,000 in 2019. The Electronics & Software segment organizes its sales force by vertical markets and segments its customers geographically. Sales by region in 2020 and 2019 were:
The following table summarizes the segment’s 2020 and 2019 sales by product group:
Sales in North America decreased 25% or $10,050,000 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to delayed project spending by customers due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, $7,050,000 of sales for a major metropolitan smart city intelligent transportation IoT project recorded in the prior year, that did not reoccur in the current year, and a decline in sales to major Canadian telecommunications customer, partially offset by strong sales to Federal agencies. International sales decreased $2,461,000, or 34%, primarily due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and an overall drop in demand for traditional products.
Sales of intelligent edge solutions (“IES”) products decreased 34% or $6,280,000 due to $7,050,000 of deliveries in the prior year for a major metropolitan smart city intelligent transportation IoT project that did not reoccur in the current year, partially offset by higher sales of security and surveillance products and sales to Federal agencies. Excluding the prior year major metropolitan smart city intelligent transportation IOT project, sales of IES products increased by $770,000 or 7%. Traditional product sales decreased 22% or $6,231,000, due mainly to the overall economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and a decline in media converter orders from major telecommunications customers.
Gross profit decreased 30% to $14,890,000 in 2020 compared to $21,394,000 in 2019. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 43% in 2020 from 46% in 2019 primarily due to the volume and favorable margin impacts from the prior year major metropolitan smart city IoT project that did not reoccur in the current year, and increased sales of some IES products to Federal agencies at lower margins, partially offset by lower inventory write-downs year over year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 20% to $13,875,000, or 40% of sales, in 2020 from $17,354,000, or 37% of sales in 2019 due to reduced travel, marketing and personnel expenses, in part due to steps taken by management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Electronics & Software had operating income of $1,015,000 in 2020 compared to operating income of $4,040,000 in 2019, primarily due to lower sales and gross margin.
Services & Support Results
Services & Support sales increased 85% to $8,777,000 in 2020 compared to $4,741,000 in 2019.
Revenues by customer group were as follows:
Revenues by revenue type were as follows:
Revenues from the education sector increased $2,557,000 or 133% in 2020 primarily due to the commencement of projects that had been previously delayed due to funding issues where the prior year had less project revenue in this sector. Projects for this education customer commenced at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Although the education vertical remains an important element of Services & Support’s overall market strategy, much of the Company’s historical revenue from the education sector has been derived from a school district in Florida. The Company has substantially completed its work on this project and was not selected as the primary vendor on the next multi-year project for this school district, but has been selected as the secondary vendor for structured cabling and enterprise networking.
Revenue from small to medium businesses (“SMBs”), which are primarily healthcare, financial and commercial clients, increased by 82% or $1,622,000 due to the acquisition of Ecessa on May 14, 2020 and the acquisition of the assets of IVDesk on November 3, 2020. The decrease in the CSI IT operations revenue as compared to 2019 is related to hardware refresh revenue in the prior year that was not repeated in the current year. Project and product revenue increased $2,878,000 or 128% during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to the increase in the education sector. Services and support revenue increased $1,158,000 or 46% as compared to the same quarter of the prior year due to the Company’s acquisition of Ecessa, which has service and support revenue on its SD-WAN products. Overall, Ecessa contributed $1,260,000 and IVDesk contributed $401,000 in revenue during the year.
Gross profit increased 101% to $2,979,000 in 2020 compared to $1,482,000 in 2019. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 34% in 2020 compared to 31% in 2019 due to the increase in project revenue in the education sector, primarily within the second half.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 80% in 2020 to $2,669,000, or 30% of sales, compared to $1,485,000 in 2019, or 31% of sales due to the May 2020 acquisition of Ecessa and the inclusion of its general and administrative costs that are not included in the prior year.
Operating income was $310,000 in 2020 compared to an operating loss of $3,000 in 2019, primarily due to increased education revenue.
Other
As a result of our treatment of Suttle as discontinued operations, “Other” includes non-allocated corporate overhead costs as well as costs allocated to Suttle that are not considered discontinued operations. In the past, the Company would estimate annual revenue and headcount for each principal business unit and then allocate a portion of shared service corporate overhead costs based on these metrics. Because Suttle is now treated as discontinued operations, these costs are now included within “Other.”
Income Taxes
The Company’s loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,775,000 in 2020 compared to income before income taxes of $235,000 in 2019. The Company’s effective income tax rate was -1.1% in 2020 compared to -6.5% in 2019. The 2020 effective rate differed from the standard rate of 21% primarily due to the valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, along with the impact of state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, and provisions for interest charges for uncertain income tax positions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward from 2015 through 2020 activity of approximately $10,940,000 that is available to offset future taxable income and begins to expire in 2035. The Company also has a federal capital loss carryforward from 2018 of approximately $1,930,000 that is available to offset future capital gains and expires in 2023. See Note 13 for a reconciliation of the standard tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
The Company is a growth-focused supplier of IoT and edge management products and IT services, providing connectivity infrastructure and services for global deployments of broadband networks. The Company continually searches for acquisition candidates with products that would enable the Company to better serve its target markets.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation has not had a significant effect on operations in recent years. The Company does not have long-term production or procurement contracts and has historically been able to adjust pricing and purchasing decisions to respond to inflationary pressures.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $21,457,000 in cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments, compared to $24,057,000 at December 31, 2019. Of this amount, $9,424,000 was invested in short-term money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or other government agency. These money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share; however, it is possible to lose money investing in these funds. The remainder in cash and cash equivalents is operating cash. The Company also had $8,364,000 in investments consisting of commercial paper and corporate notes and bonds that are traded on the open market and are classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2020.
The Company had working capital of $28,320,000, consisting of current assets of approximately $35,758,000 and current liabilities of $7,438,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to working capital of $38,052,000, consisting of current assets of $49,402,000 and current liabilities of $11,350,000 at the end of 2019.
Cash flow used in operating activities was approximately $4,684,000 in 2020 compared to $10,231,000 provided in 2019. Significant working capital changes from 2019 to 2020 included a $1.4M decrease in accounts payable and $1.5M used in discontinued operations.
Cash provided by investing activities was $3,930,000 in 2020 compared to $5,222,000 used in 2019.
Net cash used by financing activities was $800,000 in 2020 compared to $1,450,000 in 2019. Cash dividends paid on common stock decreased to $564,000 in 2020 ($0.06 per common share) from $743,000 in 2019 ($0.08 per common share). Proceeds from common stock issuances, principally shares sold to the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan and issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, totaled approximately $119,000 in 2020 and $715,000 in 2019. The Company acquired $71,000 and $2,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, of Company stock from employees to satisfy withholding tax obligations related to share-based compensation, pursuant to terms of Board and shareholder-approved compensation plans. The Company also acquired $284,000 of Company stock under a $2,000,000 Stock Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors in August 2019. At December 31, 2020, there remained $341,000 under the 2019 Stock Repurchase Program.
Line of Credit
On August 28, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, establishing a $5,000,000 line of credit facility that replaced a prior facility. On October 29, 2020, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, as amended, the Company has the ability to obtain one or more letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to $2.0 million, subject to the general terms of the Credit Agreement.
The Company had no outstanding borrowings against this line of credit, or the prior facility, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and $1,051,000 was available for use as of December 31, 2020. Interest on borrowings on the credit line is at LIBOR plus 1.25%, with a minimum LIBOR rate of 0.75% (2.0% at December 31, 2020). The credit agreement expires August 28, 2021 and is secured by government securities owned and pledged by the Company.
In connection with the Company’s November 3, 2020 purchase of the operating assets of privately held IVDesk from a third-party Receiver, the Company provided the Receiver as seller a $550,000 letter of credit to secure the Company’s obligation to pay the earn-out under the asset purchase agreement. The letter of credit was issued pursuant to the line of credit with Wells Fargo. In March 2021, the Company paid the $550,000 balance and the letter of credit was cancelled.
In the opinion of management, based on the Company’s current financial and operating position and projected future expenditures, sufficient funds are available to meet the Company’s anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs.
Future Liquidity and Capital Resources and Needs: Financing Growth
As discussed above under “Proposed Merger with Pineapple Energy,” on March 1, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Helios Merger Co. and Pineapple Energy LLC pursuant to which Pineapple would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, CSI intends to pursue dispositions of its existing assets and businesses prior to the closing of the Merger. To the extent these dispositions occur, CSI expects to declare a cash dividend that distributes a portion of the proceeds from these dispositions to its shareholders as of a pre-closing record date.
Following the Merger closing, CSI will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the dispositions of these assets as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within 18 months of the closing). Proceeds that become available from the dispositions that occur following the closing of the Merger will be distributed pro rata to the legacy shareholders pursuant to the contingent value rights agreement described above. CSI will continue to support these existing business lines as it pursues new owners for these businesses.
In connection with the execution of the Merger agreement, the Company announced that CSI and Pineapple Energy were exploring equity financing through a private placement that would close in connection with the closing of the Merger, with proceeds to be used by the combined company to finance additional acquisitions and working capital needs of the combined company.
A full description of the terms of the merger and related transactions will be provided in a proxy statement for the shareholders of CSI, as well as other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
