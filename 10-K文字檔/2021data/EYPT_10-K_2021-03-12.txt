ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of many important factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and elsewhere in this report.
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) provides a narrative of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the comparable period ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and our financial position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The MD&A should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included on pages through of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a pharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to help improve the lives of patients with serious eye disorders. Our pipeline leverages our proprietary Durasert® technology for extended intraocular drug delivery including EYP-1901, a potential twice-yearly sustained delivery intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment initially targeting wet age-related macular degeneration (“wet AMD”), the leading cause of vision loss among people 50 years of age and older in the United States. Our product candidate pipeline also includes YUTIQ50, a potential twice-yearly treatment for non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye, one of the leading causes of blindness. We also have two commercial products: YUTIQ®, a once every three-year treatment for chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye, and DEXYCU®, a single dose treatment for postoperative inflammation following ocular surgery.
Fiscal 2020 Overview and COVID-19 Impact
The fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 was highlighted by the following events:
•
Underlying customer demand and Distributor purchases by specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively, the “Distributors”) of both YUTIQ and DEXYCU was negatively impacted beginning in the first and especially the second quarter of 2020 due to shutdowns associated with the Pandemic in the U.S. Although a modest return of customer demand began in June 2020 and produced sequential product sales growth into the third and fourth quarters, we expect these reduced demand levels to continue through the duration of the Pandemic until various restrictions on elective surgeries and office visits are fully removed. During the Pandemic, our sales organization continued to call on such offices, though at a reduced frequency. There have been no disruptions to the supply chains for YUTIQ and DEXYCU during the Pandemic and we continue to produce finished product for commercial sale.
•
In January 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ocumension Therapeutics for the development and commercialization in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan of DEXYCU for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery. Under the terms of the license agreement, we received an upfront payment of $2 million and will be eligible to receive up to an additional $12.0 million if certain future prespecified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones are achieved by Ocumension. In addition, we are entitled to receive a mid-single digit sales-based royalty. In exchange, Ocumension will receive exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the product in the greater China territory, at its own cost and expense with us supplying product for clinical trials and commercial sale.
•
In February 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.50 per share. The gross proceeds of the offering were $21,750,000, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other transaction expenses. This offering closed on February 25, 2020.
•
In April 2020, we announced a reorganization of our commercial operations and the cancellation or deferral of planned spending to conserve cash due to the impact of the Pandemic, particularly the postponement of nearly all elective surgeries including cataract surgery. This reorganization was primarily focused on a reduction in the external contract sales organization for DEXYCU. We allocated our remaining DEXYCU commercial resources to high-volume ASCs in key U.S. regions. The reorganization was expected to result in annual savings of approximately $7 million and one-time savings of approximately $10 million from other planned expenditure cancellations and deferrals.
•
In April 2020, we received a $2.0 million Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan through the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of
2020 (the CARES Act). The PPP loan enabled us to retain key commercial infrastructure and employees and avoid furloughs as product demand and revenues remained significantly reduced due to ASC and physician office closures necessitated by the Pandemic. We used the proceeds of the PPP loan to cover payroll costs, rent and utilities in accordance with the CARES Act and anticipate the loan will be fully forgiven.
•
In August 2020, we announced the signing of a commercial alliance for the joint promotion of DEXYCU with ImprimisRx (Harrow Health). Through this agreement, we are able to access the established and complementary ImprimisRx commercial operations in cataract surgery to include DEXYCU as a prioritized product in its existing portfolio of product offerings.
•
In August 2020, we received $9.5 million from Ocumension Therapeutics under the Memorandum of Understanding (“2020 MOU”). This expanded agreement grants Ocumension the rights to commercialize both YUTIQ and DEXYCU under their own brand names in South Korea and other jurisdictions across Southeast Asia and acts as the full and final prepayment of all remaining development, regulatory, and commercial sale milestone payments under the original license agreements. We remain entitled to receive royalties on future sales of these products by Ocumension.
•
In October 2020, we announced an amendment to our existing debt facility with CRG Servicing LLC (CRG). Under the terms of the amendment, CRG waived the covenant associated with our net product revenue of YUTIQ and DEXYCU for the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2020. The parties also agreed to a reduction of the December 31, 2021 net product revenue covenant to $45 million from $80 million based on the promising recovery and return in customer demand for both products at that time following COVID-19-related closures. There were no additional costs incurred by us for the waiver.
•
In December 2020, we announced a 1-for-10 reverse stock split which enabled us to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market.
•
In December 2020, we announced a $16.5 million monetization of our ILUVIEN Royalty (Alimera) with SWK Holdings Corporation. $15 million of the net proceeds was applied against existing debt obligations with CRG Servicing LLC.
•
In December 2020, we announced a $15.7 million equity investment by Ocumension Therapeutics, our partner in Asia.
Recent Developments
Recent developments and ongoing activities regarding the commercialization of YUTIQ include:
•
Customer demand in Q4, represented as units purchased by physicians from our distributors, was up 10% over Q3, driven by underlying growth.
Recent developments and ongoing activities regarding the commercialization of DEXYCU include:
•
Customer demand in Q4, represented as units purchased by ambulatory surgical centers, was up 30% over Q3, driven by increases in cataract surgeries and some re-opening of ASC’s.
•
DEXYCU co-promotion partner, ImprimisRx®, began driving volume through its experienced cataract surgery field force, materially adding to Q4 customer demand.
•
In February 2021, we sold 10,465,000 shares of Common Stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of $11.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 1,365,000 additional shares of our common stock. The gross proceeds of the offering are approximately $115.1 million. Underwriter discounts and commissions and other share issue costs totaled approximately $7.1 million.
R&D Highlights
•
In February 2020, we signed an exclusive license agreement with Equinox Science, LLC, to develop vorolanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy. Vorolanib is being developed as EYP-1901 utilizing a bioerodible formulation of our Durasert technology.
•
In March 2020, we announced positive topline 36-month follow-up data from the second Phase 3 trial of YUTIQ for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. This second double-masked, randomized Phase 3 trial of YUTIQ enrolled 153 patients in 15 clinical centers in India, with 101 eyes treated with YUTIQ and 52 eyes receiving sham injections. At 36-months, the recurrence rate in YUTIQ randomized eyes was significantly lower than in sham treated eyes (46.5% vs. 75.0%, respectively; p=0.001). Visual acuity gains or losses of 3-lines or more were both similar between treatment groups. Safety data showed no unanticipated side effects at each follow-up timepoint at 12, 24 and 36-months. These positive results were consistent with the findings from the first Phase 3 study of YUTIQ and provide further validation of its long-term ability to reduce uveitic flares.
•
Positive retrospective case study data supporting DEXYCU was highlighted in an oral presentation at the 2020 Caribbean Eye Meeting in an oral session entitled, “Drug Delivery: Real-World Experience With Dexamethasone Intraocular
Suspension”. The ongoing retrospective study is designed to provide large-scale, real-world data on early experiences with DEXYCU from surgeons. Interim results presented are from 154 patients administered DEXYCU with each time point of data based on patient chart data and frequency of measurement by participating physicians. The proportion of patients with complete anterior chamber cell clearing (cell score=0) was 47.5%, 50.0%, 84.1% and 87.5% at postoperative day 1, 8, 14 and 30, respectively. The proportion of patients with no anterior chamber flares (flare score=0), another measurement of inflammation, was 77.7%, 98.5%, 98.8% and 99.1% at postoperative day 1, 8, 14 and 30, respectively. Mean intraocular pressure at postoperative day 1 was 17.6mmHg, with levels decreasing through to postoperative day 30.
•
In July 2020, we announced the appointment of Dr. Jay Duker as our Chief Strategic Scientific Officer. Dr. Duker brings more than thirty years of ophthalmology experience with roles held in the clinical, research, business, and academic settings. Dr. Duker is also the Director of the New England Eye Center. He is also Professor and Chair of Ophthalmology at Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine, as well as the Chairman of the Board of Sesen Bio, Inc., a publicly traded clinical stage biopharmaceutical company.
•
In December 2020, we reported positive results from our GLP Toxicology Study of EYP-1901, a potential twice-yearly sustained-delivery intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment targeting wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD.
•
In December 2020, we filed an IND application with the FDA for a Phase 1 trial for EYP-1901, and subsequently dosed the first patient in the Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2021.
Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience, anticipated results and trends and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. By their nature, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and management evaluates them on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. It is important that the discussion of our operating results that follows be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies discussed below.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Sales, value add, and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.
Product sales, net - We sell YUTIQ and DEXYCU to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively the “Distributors”) in the U.S., with whom we have entered into formal agreements, for delivery to physician practices for YUTIQ and to hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgical centers for DEXYCU. We recognize revenue on sales of our products when Distributors obtain control of the products, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery. In addition to agreements with Distributors, we also enter into arrangements with healthcare providers, ambulatory surgical centers, and payors that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks, and discounts with respect to their purchase of our products from Distributors.
Reserves for variable consideration - Product sales are recorded at the wholesale acquisition costs, net of applicable reserves for variable consideration. Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, provider chargebacks and discounts, payor rebates, product returns, and other allowances that are offered within contracts between us and our Distributors, payors, and other contracted purchasers relating to our product sales. These reserves, as detailed below, are based on the amounts earned, or to be claimed on the related sales, and are classified either as reductions of product revenue and accounts receivable or a current liability, depending on how the amount is to be settled. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the respective underlying contracts. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
Distribution fees - We compensate our Distributors for services explicitly stated in our contracts and they are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product sale is recognized.
Provider chargebacks and discounts - Chargebacks are discounts that represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products at prices lower than the list prices charged to our Distributors. These Distributors charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and our contracted selling price. These reserves are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability. Reserves for chargebacks consist of amounts that we expect to pay for units that remain in the distribution channel inventories at each reporting period-end that we expect will be sold under a contracted selling price, and chargebacks that Distributors have claimed, but for which we have not yet settled.
Government rebates - We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but which remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.
Payor rebates - We contract with certain private payor organizations, primarily insurance companies, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our products. We estimate these rebates and records such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.
Co-Payment assistance - We offer co-payment assistance to commercially insured patients meeting certain eligibility requirements. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue.
Product returns - We generally offer a limited right of return based on our returned goods policy, which includes damaged product and remaining shelf life. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, as well as reductions to trade receivables, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
License and collaboration agreement revenue - We analyze each element of our license and collaboration arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition. The terms of the license agreement may include payment to us of non-refundable up-front license fees, milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved, and/or royalties on product sales. We recognize revenue from upfront payments at a point in time, typically upon fulfilling the delivery of the associated intellectual property to the customer.
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. We determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
We recognize sales-based milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of the cumulative sales amount specified in the contract in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65. For those milestone payments which are contingent on the occurrence of particular future events, we determine that these need to be considered for inclusion in the calculation of total consideration from the contract as a component of variable consideration using the most-likely amount method. As such, we assess each milestone to determine the probability and substance behind achieving each milestone. Given the inherent uncertainty associated with these future events, we will not recognize revenue from such milestones until there is a high probability of occurrence, which typically occurs near or upon achievement of the event.
When determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. Applying the practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-32-18, we do not assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less. None of our contracts contained a significant financing component as of December 31, 2020.
Reimbursement of costs - We may provide research and development services and incur maintenance costs of licensed patents under collaboration arrangements to assist in advancing the development of licensed products. We act primarily as a principal in these transactions and, accordingly, reimbursement amounts received are classified as a component of revenue to be recognized consistent with the revenue recognition policy summarized above. We record the expenses incurred and reimbursed on a gross basis.
Royalties - We recognize revenue from license arrangements with our commercial partners’ net sales of products. Such revenues are included as royalty income. In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65, royalties are recognized when the subsequent sale of the commercial partner’s products occurs. Our commercial partners are obligated to report their net product sales and the resulting royalty due to us typically within 60 days from the end of each quarter. Based on historical product sales, royalty receipts and other relevant information, we recognize royalty income each quarter and subsequently determine a true-up when we receive royalty reports and payment from our commercial partners. Historically, these true-up adjustments have been immaterial.
Sale of Future Royalties - We have sold our rights to receive certain royalties on product sales. In the circumstance where we have sold our rights to future royalties under a royalty purchase agreement and also maintains limited continuing involvement in the arrangement (but not significant continuing involvement in the generation of the cash flows that are due to the purchaser), we defer recognition of the proceeds we receive for the sale of royalty streams and recognizes such unearned revenue as revenue under the units-of-revenue method over the life of the underlying license agreement. Under the units-of-revenue method, amortization for a reporting period is calculated by computing a ratio of the proceeds received from the purchaser to the total payments expected to be made to the purchaser over the term of the agreement, and then applying that ratio to the period’s cash payment.
Estimating the total payments expected to be received by the purchaser over the term of such arrangements requires management to use subjective estimates and assumptions. Changes to our estimate of the payments expected to be made to the purchaser over the term of such arrangements could have a material effect on the amount of revenues recognized in any particular period.
Research Collaborations - We recognize revenue over the term of the statements of work under any funded research collaborations. Revenue recognition for consideration, if any, related to a license option right is assessed based on the terms of any such future license agreement or is otherwise recognized at the completion of the research collaborations. Please refer to Note 3 for further details on the license and collaboration agreements into which we have entered and corresponding amounts of revenue recognized during the current and prior year periods.
Deferred Revenue
Amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized within one year following the balance sheet date are classified as non-current deferred revenue.
Please refer to Note 4 for further details on the license and collaboration agreements into which we have entered and corresponding amounts of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Recognition of Expense in Outsourced Clinical Trial Agreements
We recognize research and development expense with respect to outsourced agreements for clinical trials with contract research organizations (“CROs”) as the services are provided, based on our assessment of the services performed. We make our assessments of the services performed based on various factors, including evaluation by the third-party CROs and our own internal review of the work performed during the period, measurements of progress by us or by the third-party CROs, data analysis with respect to work completed and our management’s judgment. We had agreements with two CROs to conduct the Phase 3 clinical trial program for YUTIQ, which we completed in the first half of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there were no material obligations remaining under those agreements. In August 2020, we entered into an agreement with a CRO to conduct a Phase 1 study for EYP-1901, which we started in the first quarter of 2021.
During 2020 and 2019, we recognized approximately $91,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, of research and development expense attributable to our YUTIQ Phase 3 clinical trial program. Changes in our estimates or differences between the actual level of services performed and our estimates may result in changes to our research and development expenses in future periods.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Product Sales, net
Product sales, net represents the gross sales of YUTIQ and DEXYCU less provisions for product sales allowances. Product sales, net increased by $4.0 million to $20.8 million for 2020 compared to $16.8 million in the prior year. We commenced U.S. commercial sales of YUTIQ in February 2019 and DEXYCU in March 2019. Product sales during 2020 were negatively impacted due to shutdowns associated with the Pandemic in the U.S. Although we did see a modest return of customer demand for both products in the third and fourth quarters, we expect demand to continue at decreased levels through the duration of the Pandemic until restrictions on elective surgeries and office visits are removed. Please see the Recent Development section for more information on the impact of the Pandemic on, among other things, our product sales.
License and collaboration agreement
License and collaboration agreement revenues increased by $10.6 million to $11.9 million in 2020 compared to $1.4 million in 2019. This increase was attributable primarily to the recognition of $9.5 million under our Ocumension 2020 MOU entered into August 2020 (see Note 3) as well as approximately $2.0 million from Ocumension upon signing a license agreement for DEXYCU in China, compared with $1.0 million recognized in 2019.
Royalty Income
Royalty income decreased by $516,000 to $1.7 million in 2020. The decrease was attributable to the impact of the royalty monetization agreement with SWK Holdings that grants to SWK all future royalty payments under the Amended Alimera Agreement beginning with Q4 2020 for a one-time payment of $16.5 million. Due to the accounting treatment for this agreement (see Revenue Recognition section), we did not record any accrued royalty revenue under the Amended Alimera Agreement in Q4-2020 and we will
recognize a non-cash portion of deferred revenue as Alimera pays royalties to SWK beginning in Q1 2021 (see Note 3). Accordingly, revenue recognized for Alimera Royalty Income is expected to be lower in future periods based on this methodology.
Separately, the quarter ended March 31, 2019 was the last period we recognized the Retisert royalty as the licensee, Bausch and Lomb informed us in early 2019 that they consider this agreement to have ended due to the expiration of certain patents.
Cost of Sales, Excluding Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased by $3.1 million to $5.84 million for fiscal 2020 from $2.7 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) approximately $1.3 million of royalty expense associated with the $9.5 million received from Ocumension under the 2020 MOU as well as $2 million received from the Ocumension DEXYCU signing payment received, (ii) $897,000 from a one-time write-down of out of specification DEXYCU production batches from our third-party manufacturer and (iii) increased costs associated with higher product sales, primarily product cost and distribution fees.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased by $2.1 million to $17.4 million for 2020 from $15.4 million in the prior year. This increase was attributable primarily to (i) approximately $1.4 million of expense for EYP-1901 related studies, (ii) a $1.0 million payment for the licensing of Vorolanib (EYP-1901), (iii) approximately $650,000 in lab and non-clinical expenses primarily for support of the EYP-1901 initiatives and (iv) approximately $422,000 of expense for DEXYCU related studies, partially offset by approximate comparative decreases of (i) $1.1 million in YUTIQ Phase 3 expense as the trial ended in Q2 2020 and (ii) $385,000 in stability and other testing.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by approximately $4.5 million to $25.3 million for fiscal 2020 from $29.8 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily attributable to (i) approximately $4.0 million of net contract sales organization (CSO) expenses due to the reduction in DEXYCU KAMs as per our previously announced restructuring plan, including severance and (ii) $1.6 million in marketing and related expenses in conjunction with our restructuring plan, partially offset by (i) an approximate $900,000 increase in personnel (other than KAMs converted to employees) and related expenses, primarily from the full year to date impact of prior year additions.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million to $20.7 million for 2020 from $17.9 million in the prior year. This increase was attributable primarily to (i) $1.0 million in legal and other professional fees, (ii) $666,000 in insurance expense, due primarily to D&O policy costs, (iii) $597,000 in consulting expenses and (iv) $432,000 in personnel and related expenses.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquired intangible assets totaled $2.5 million for both 2020 and 2019. This amount was attributable to the DEXYCU product intangible asset that resulted from the Icon Acquisition (see Note 5).
Interest (Expense) Income
Interest expense totaled $7.3 million for 2020, which included $745,000 of amortization of debt discount and $977,000 of non-cash payment-in-kind interest expense all related to the CRG Debt. Interest expense in 2019 was $6.2 million which included $596,000 of amortization of debt discount and $1.1 million of non-cash payment-in-kind interest expense. During the prior year period, we extinguished the SWK Loan and established a new term loan facility with CRG (see Note 9).
Interest income from amounts invested in an institutional money market fund decreased to $58,000 for fiscal 2020 compared to $1.1 million, due primarily to reduced interest-bearing assets and lower money market interest rates versus 2019.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
In Q4 2020, we paid down $13.7 million to partially reduce principal on the CRG term loan. We recorded a $905,000 loss on partial extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of the balance of unamortized debt discount related to this partial prepayment.
Repayment of the SWK Loan in February 2019 resulted in a $3.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which consisted of (i) a $2.3 million write-off of the remaining balance of unamortized debt discount; (ii) a $1.2 million prepayment penalty; and (iii) a $306,000 make-whole interest payment covering the period from the date of the loan repayment to what would have been the first anniversary of the original loan closing date, or March 28, 2019.
Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
New accounting pronouncements are issued periodically by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise disclosed below, we believe that the impact of recently issued and adopted pronouncements will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”). In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which contains certain amendments to ASU 2016-02 intended to provide relief in implementing the new standard. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all operating leases, with an exception provided for leases with a duration of one year or less. We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach which, pursuant to ASU 2018-11, allows companies to recognize existing leases at the adoption date without requiring comparable period presentation. Comparative periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840, Leases.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, to replace the current incurred loss impairment methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information, including forecasted information, to develop credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) (“ASU 2019-12”): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. This standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this update will have on our consolidated financial statements, but do not believe the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have had a history of operating losses and an absence of significant recurring cash inflows from revenue, and at December 31, 2020 we had a total accumulated deficit of $510.7 million. Our operations have been financed primarily from sales of our equity securities, issuance of debt and a combination of license fees, milestone payments, royalty income and other fees received from collaboration partners. In the first quarter of 2019, we commenced the U.S. launch of our first two commercial products, YUTIQ and DEXYCU. However, we have not received sufficient revenues from our product sales to fund operations and we do not expect revenues from our product sales to generate sufficient funding to sustain our operations in the near-term.
Financing Activities
Our operations for fiscal 2020 were financed primarily from $22.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, approximately $20.0 million of gross proceeds from the February 2020 underwritten stock offering and approximately $14.2 million from sales under our at-the-market facility. In addition, on April 8, 2020, we submitted an application through Silicon Valley Bank for the Paycheck Protection Program Loan (the “PPP Loan”) pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). On April 22, 2020, we received PPP Loan proceeds of $2.0 million. We also received $15.7 million in December 2020 from an equity investment by Ocumension. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents of $44.9 million at December 31, 2020, we received incremental financing cash flows of approximately $108 million net proceeds from our February 2021 stock offering.
The CRG Loan is due and payable on December 31, 2023 (the “Maturity Date”). The CRG Loan bears interest at a per annum rate (subject to increase during an event of default) equal to 12.5%, of which 2.5% may be paid in-kind at our election, so long as no
default or event of default under the CRG Loan Agreement has occurred and is continuing. We are required to make interest only payments on a quarterly basis until the Maturity Date. We will also be required to pay an exit fee equal to 6% of the aggregate principal amounts advanced (including any paid-in-kind amounts) under the CRG Loan Agreement. to certain exceptions, we are required to make mandatory prepayments of the CRG Loan with the proceeds of assets sales and in the event of a change of control of our Company. In addition, we may make a voluntary prepayment of the CRG Loan, in whole or in part, at any time. All mandatory and voluntary prepayments of the CRG Loan are subject to the payment of prepayment premiums as follows: (i) if prepayment occurs after December 31, 2019 and on or prior to December 31, 2020, 5% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CRG Loan being prepaid and (ii) if prepayment occurs after December 31, 2020 and on or prior to December 31, 2021, an amount equal to 3% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CRG Loan being prepaid. No prepayment premium is due on any principal prepaid after December 31, 2021.
Certain of our existing and future subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, are guaranteeing the obligations of ours under the Loan Agreement. Our obligations under the Loan Agreement and the guarantee of such obligations are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our and the Guarantors’ assets.
The CRG Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ abilities, among other things, to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions and enter into affiliate transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the CRG Loan Agreement contains the following financial covenants requiring us and the Guarantors to maintain:
•
liquidity in an amount which shall exceed the greater of (i) $5 million and (ii) to the extent we have incurred certain permitted debt, the minimum cash balance, if any, required of us by the creditors of such permitted debt; and
•
annual minimum product revenue from YUTIQ and DEXYCU: (i) for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2021, of at least $45 million and (ii) for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2022, of at least $90 million.
On October 8, 2020, we entered into a Waiver to the CRG Loan Agreement (the “Waiver”) pursuant to which CRG waived the financial covenant associated with our revenue derived from sales of YUTIQ and DEXYCU for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 and reduced the revenue covenant for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2021 from $80 million to $45 million. On November 19, 2019, we entered into a Waiver to the CRG Loan Agreement (the “Waiver”) pursuant to which CRG waived the financial covenant associated with our revenue derived from sales of YUTIQ and DEXYCU for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019. If we do not maintain compliance with all of the continuing covenants and other terms and conditions of the CRG Loan or secure a waiver for any non-compliance, then the Lenders may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts outstanding, plus penalties and interest, including an exit fee and any prepayment fees, and foreclose on the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Such repayment would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
On December 17, 2020, we paid $15.0 million against the CRG Loan obligations in connection with the consummation of the RPA agreement (see Note 3). In addition to repayment of the $13.8 million principal portion of the CRG Loan, we paid (i) the $828,000 Exit Fee, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest of $378,000 through that date. CRG waived the financial covenant in the CRG Loan associated with the payment of prepayment premiums if prepayment occurred after December 31, 2019 and on or prior to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our outstanding balance, including principal and the exit fee, under the CRG Loan was approximately $40.5 million, and consisted of approximately $38.3 million of carrying value (see Note 14), and $2.2 million of the remaining balance of unamortized debt discount related to the CRG Loan.
Future Funding Requirements
At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $44.9 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents combined with the $108 million of net proceeds from the February 2021 stock offering and anticipated net cash inflows from product sales will fund our operating plan through the second quarter of 2022, under current expectations regarding (i) the timing and outcomes of our Phase 1 clinical trial for EYP-1901 for the treatment of wet AMD, and (ii) initiation of our Phase 2 clinical trials for EYP-1901 for the treatment of wet AMD. Due to the difficulty and uncertainty associated with the design and implementation of clinical trials, we will continue to assess our cash and cash equivalents and future funding requirements. However, there is no assurance that additional funding will be achieved and that we will succeed in our future operations.
Actual cash requirements could differ from management’s projections due to many factors, including cash generation from sales of YUTIQ and DEXYCU, additional investments in research and development programs, clinical trial expenses for EYP-1901, competing technological and market developments and the costs of any strategic acquisitions and/or development of complementary business opportunities. In addition, the Pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material and adverse impact on our
business, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments are taking. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and will likely continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our commercial products as customers have shut down their facilities and non-essential surgical procedures have been postponed in an effort to promote social distancing and to redirect medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of COVID-19.
The amount of additional capital we will require will be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the potential for EYP-1901, as a twice-yearly sustained delivery intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment targeting wet age-related macular degeneration (“wet AMD”), with potential in diabetic retinopathy (“DR”) and retinal vein occlusion (“RVO”);
•
our expectations regarding the timing and clinical development of our product candidates, including EYP-1901 and YUTIQ50;
•
the success of our U.S. direct commercialization of YUTIQ for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye including, among other things, patient and physician acceptance of YUTIQ and our ability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for YUTIQ;
•
the success of our U.S. direct commercialization of DEXYCU for the treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation including, among other things, patient and physician acceptance of DEXYCU and our ability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for DEXYCU;
•
the cost of commercialization activities for YUTIQ and DEXYCU, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution;
•
whether and to what extent we internally fund, whether and when we initiate, and how we conduct other product development programs;
•
payments we receive under any new collaboration agreements;
•
whether and when we are able to enter into strategic arrangements for our products or product candidates and the nature of those arrangements;
•
the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims;
•
changes in our operating plan, resulting in increases or decreases in our need for capital;
•
the duration, scope and outcome of the SEC investigation and its impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
•
the forgiveness of the $2.0M PPP Loan by the U.S. Small Business Administration
•
our views on the availability, timing and desirability of raising capital; and
•
the extent to which our business could be adversely impacted by the effects of the Pandemic or by other pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks.
We do not know if additional capital will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Collaboration, licensing or other agreements may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We do not know the extent to which we will receive funds from the commercialization of YUTIQ or DEXYCU. If we seek to sell our equity securities, we do not know whether and to what extent we will be able to do so, or on what terms. If available, additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and dilute our existing stockholders’ equity, and funding through collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements may be on unfavorable terms, including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. If adequate financing is not available if and when needed, we may delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research or development programs, independent commercialization of YUTIQ and DEXYCU, or other new products, if any, postpone or cancel the pursuit of product candidates, or otherwise significantly curtail our operations to reduce our cash requirements and extend our capital.
