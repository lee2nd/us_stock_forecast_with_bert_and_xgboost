Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing next-generation viral immunotherapies to transform outcomes for cancer patients. Using our two distinct proprietary platforms, we are developing a pipeline of intratumorally and intravenously administered product candidates designed to selectively attack and kill tumor cells and deliver transgenes to stimulate multiple arms of the immune system against tumors. Our lead product candidate, ONCR-177, is an intratumorally administered viral immunotherapy based on our oncolytic HSV-1 platform, referred to as our oHSV Platform, which leverages the Herpes Simplex Virus-1, or HSV-1, a virus which has been clinically proven to effectively treat certain cancers. Utilizing this proprietary platform, we are engineering our product candidates, such as ONCR-177, to carry greater numbers of immunostimulatory transgenes than viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development. These transgenes are designed to drive strong systemic anti-tumor immunity to elicit tumor responses at injected and distant non-injected tumor sites, or abscopal activity. In addition, viruses from our oHSV Platform maintain full viral replication competency in tumors and are designed to be selectively attenuated in normal tissues. We believe this unique combination of features allows us to break the safety versus potency trade-off that has generally limited the viral immunotherapy field to date. In June 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 in several different tumor types. We are also developing a broad pipeline of product candidates that leverages our second platform, which we refer to as our Synthetic Platform, to enable repeat intravenous administration of viral immunotherapies in order to treat cancers that are less amenable to intratumoral injection due to safety and feasibility reasons, such as cancers of the lung.
Since inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our technology, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies, commencing a clinical trial and manufacturing scale-up activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, or Series A, Series A-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock, or Series A-1, Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, or Series B, an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock and a follow-on public offering, or the Follow-on Offering, of our common stock in February 2021. In 2019, we conducted a Series B financing, with the funding occurring in two tranches. We closed the first tranche of the Series B financing in August 2019 and November 2019, raising $53.8 million of gross proceeds. In September 2020, we achieved the clinical development milestones that triggered the second and final tranche of the Series B financing, and as a result we received an additional $35.8 million of gross proceeds. In October 2020, we completed our IPO, in which we issued an aggregate of 6,557,191 shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $88.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us of $3.2 million. Our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “ONCR” on October 2, 2020. Upon closing of our IPO, all outstanding shares of Series A-1 and Series B converted into an aggregate of 14,951,554 shares of common stock. In February 2021, we completed a Follow-on Offering, in which we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock for aggregate estimated net proceeds of approximately $53.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
From inception through December 31, 2020, we have raised an aggregate of $249.3 million of gross proceeds through the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and the sale of our common stock in the IPO.
On September 25, 2020, we effected a 1-for-12.0874 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock and a proportional adjustment to the existing conversion ratios for the outstanding shares of Series A-1 and Series B. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split on a retroactive basis.
Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $48.3 million and $30.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $129.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we advance our current and future product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture drug product and drug supply, seek regulatory approval for our current and future product candidates, maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio, hire additional research and development and business personnel and operate as a public company.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and do not enter into a third-party commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities.
We will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $130.3 million. In February 2021, we completed a Follow-on Offering, in which we received aggregate net proceeds of $53.0 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with the proceeds from our Follow-on Offering, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into late 2023.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of governmental orders and other public health guidance measures have been implemented across much of the United States, including in the locations of our office, clinical trial sites and third parties on whom we rely. We anticipate that our clinical development timelines could be negatively affected by COVID-19, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we have implemented a work-from-home policy allowing employees who can work from home to do so, while those needing to work in laboratory facilities work in shifts to reduce the number of people gathered together at one time. Business travel has been suspended, and online and teleconference technology is used to meet virtually rather than in person. We have taken measures to secure our research and development project activities, while work in laboratories has been organized to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact our business. For example, with our personnel working from home, some of our research activities that require our personnel to be in our laboratories could be delayed.
Components of Operating Results
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our product candidate discovery efforts, preclinical and clinical studies under our research programs, which include:
∎
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our research and development personnel;
∎
costs of funding research performed by third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical and clinical activities on our behalf;
∎
costs of manufacturing drug product and drug supply related to our current or future product candidates;
∎
costs of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates;
∎
consulting and professional fees related to research and development activities, including equity-based compensation to non-employees;
∎
costs of maintaining our laboratory, including purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical studies;
∎
costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements;
∎
facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies; and
∎
fees for maintaining licenses and other amounts due under our third-party licensing agreements.
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as information provided to us by our vendors and analyzing the progress of our preclinical and clinical studies or other services performed. Significant judgment and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense balances at the end of any reporting period.
We track external research and development costs on a program-by-program basis beginning, with respect to each program, upon our internal nomination of a candidate in that program for further preclinical and clinical development. External costs include fees paid to consultants, contractors and vendors, including contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and clinical research organizations, or CROs, in connection with our preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities and license milestone payments related to candidate development. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, costs incurred for laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation, or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete development of our current or future product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of our product candidates, if they are approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of:
∎
the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing research activities as well as any preclinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development activities;
∎
establishing an appropriate safety profile;
∎
successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
∎
whether our product candidates show safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;
∎
receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
∎
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
∎
obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
∎
commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
∎
continued acceptable safety profile of the products following any regulatory approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our current and future product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of those product candidates.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we commence clinical trials and continue the development of our current and future product candidates. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include salaries and other compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and accounting, business development, operations and administrative roles. Other significant costs include professional service and consulting fees including legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, accounting fees, recruiting costs and costs for consultants who we utilize to supplement our personnel, insurance costs, travel costs, facility and office-related costs not included in research and development expenses and depreciation and amortization.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as our business expands to support expected growth in research and development activities, including our future clinical programs. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside service providers, among other expenses. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs for audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and listing standards applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a third-party commercialization collaboration, we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales and marketing team to support product sales, marketing and distribution activities.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) primarily includes changes in fair value of the Series B tranche rights and interest income, net.
Included in the terms of the Series B stock purchase agreement in August 2019 were tranche rights granted to the holders of the Series B. The tranche rights provided the Series B holders with the right to purchase additional shares of Series B in an additional tranche under certain events. The tranche rights met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument as the tranche rights were legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series B. The tranche rights were initially recorded at fair value as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The tranche rights were subsequently re-measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period and at settlement, which occurred in September 2020, when the second and final tranche of the Series B financing closed. Changes in the fair value were recognized as a component of other income (expense).
Interest income primarily consists of interest income from our cash and cash equivalents.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Research and Development Expenses
The table below summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program and unallocated research and development expenses for each of the periods presented:
Research and development expenses increased from $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $3.1 million, or 13%, was primarily the result of:
∎
a $0.8 million decrease in direct external expenses of ONCR-177, as 2019 included IND-enabling costs, including preclinical studies and external support costs which did not recur in 2020. Manufacturing costs in 2020 also decreased
compared to 2019 related to the timing of the production of drug product and drug supply. Offsetting this decrease was an increase in clinical costs related to the Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177, which began in 2020;
∎
a $2.9 million increase in employee compensation costs, including salaries, bonus and employee benefits, due to increased headcount in 2020 as compared to 2019. Employee compensation costs also increased due to higher stock compensation expense from increased stock option grants to existing and new employees at higher share prices in 2020 compared to 2019;
∎
a $1.1 million increase in external research, development and consulting that was primarily attributable to costs incurred from the increased activities related to our synthetic platform and consulting costs related to planning for our manufacturing facility;
∎
a $0.1 million increase in laboratory supply costs resulting from increased headcount and activity related to drug discovery; and
∎
a $0.3 million decrease in other expenses due to a license payment made in 2019 that did not recur in 2020 as well as reduced travel and related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense for new equipment.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased from $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $2.9 million, or 40%, was primarily the result of:
∎
a $1.8 million increase in employee compensation costs including salaries, bonus and employee benefits, due to increased headcount in 2020 as compared to 2019. Employee compensation costs also increased due to higher stock compensation expense from increased stock option grants to existing and new employees at higher share prices in 2020 compared to 2019; and
∎
a $1.1 million increase in professional service and consultant fees primarily related to increased corporate legal fees associated with our growth and increased legal intellectual property activity as we incurred fees to broaden our intellectual property portfolio, increased consultant costs incurred to support our growth, and increased insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases in legal and audit costs related to the IPO, which were expensed in 2019 due to the timing of the offering.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $11.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a loss of $11.3 million in 2020 related to the increase in the fair value of the Series B tranche rights liability that was recorded through the settlement date. The significant increase in the fair value of the Series B tranche liability was due to reaching the second tranche clinical milestones and the increased fair value of the underlying Series B at the date of settlement. A decrease in interest income from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to lower returns on invested cash, also contributed to the overall decrease.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
From inception through December 31, 2020, we funded our operations with gross proceeds of $249.3 million from sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and the sale of common stock in the IPO. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $130.3 million. In 2019, we conducted a Series B financing with the funding occurring in two tranches. We closed the first tranche of the Series B financing in August 2019 and November 2019, raising a total of $53.8 million of gross proceeds. The second and final tranche of the Series B financing provided for an additional $35.8 million of gross proceeds, which we received in September 2020 upon the achievement of certain clinical development milestones for our primary product candidate, ONCR-177. In October 2020, we completed the IPO, which provided aggregate net proceeds of $88.3 million. In February 2021, we completed the Follow-on Offering, which provided approximately $53.0 million of estimated net proceeds.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $36.8 million and was primarily related to our net loss for the period of $48.3 million, partially offset by non-cash activity consisting of an $11.3 million increase in the fair value of the Series B tranche rights liability, stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million, and depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million. Cash used in operations was increased by a $2.9 million cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. This outflow was driven by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.5 million primarily related to the prepayment of insurance and a $0.9 million net decrease in the operating lease liability and associated right-of-use asset related to lease payments. These cash outflows were offset by cash inflows related to a $0.3 million increase in accounts payable that was a result of increased activity in 2020 compared to 2019 as well as the timing of invoicing and payments and a $0.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which was primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation costs.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $27.2 million and was primarily related to our net loss for the period of $30.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges consisting of depreciation and amortization of $1.1 million and stock-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million. Cash used in operations was offset by a $1.7 million cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The cash inflow was driven by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.2 million. This decrease was a result of decreased payments to vendors in advance of services in 2019 compared to 2018. Also adding to the inflow was a $1.9 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to overall expense growth and the timing of invoicing as well as an increase in accrued compensation related to increased headcount. These inflows were partially offset by a cash outflow related to a $0.4 million decrease in deferred rent due to the timing of payments in comparison to the rent expense, which is being recorded on a straight-line basis.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and consisted of the purchase of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $125.8 million and $53.4 million, respectively. We closed the first tranche of the Series B financing in 2019, raising $53.8 million of gross proceeds. In 2020, we achieved the clinical development milestones that triggered the second and final tranche of the Series B financing, and as a result we received an additional $35.8 million of gross proceeds. In 2020, we completed the IPO, which provided net proceeds of $89.8 million. This amount of net proceeds from the IPO excludes $1.5 million of legal and accounting costs that were expensed in 2019 and subsequently paid, due to the delayed timing of the IPO. Taking into account these previously expensed amounts, we received $88.3 million of aggregate net proceeds from the IPO.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our research and development, initiate clinical trials, build out our manufacturing facility and seek marketing approval for our current and any of our future product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our current or our future product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, which costs we may seek to offset through entry into collaboration agreements with third parties. Furthermore, as a result of our IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents along with the proceeds from our Follow-on Offering will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into late 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including:
∎
the costs of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;
∎
the costs of manufacturing;
∎
the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for product candidates we may develop, if any;
∎
the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
∎
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
∎
the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any license or collaboration agreements we might have at such time;
∎
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
∎
the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
∎
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims;
∎
our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and research and development activities; and
∎
the costs of operating as a public company.
Our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to complete development of ONCR-177 or any other product candidate. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding to achieve our business objectives.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
If we raise funds through potential collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.
We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense.
In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid balance accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. The reversal of compensation cost previously recognized for an award that is forfeited because of a failure to satisfy a service or performance condition is recognized in the period of the forfeiture. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. For performance-based awards that are awarded, we apply the graded-vesting method to the awards once the achievement of the performance conditions is considered to be probable.
We classify equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified. In future periods, we expect equity-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense and as we grant additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain employees.
Determination of the Fair Value of Equity-Based Awards
Prior to the IPO, because there was no public market for our common stock as a private company, our board of directors determined the fair value of common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including having contemporaneous and retrospective valuations of our equity performed by a third-party valuation specialist, valuations of comparable peer public companies, sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of our common stock, and general and industry-specific economic outlook. Following our IPO, the closing sale price per share of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant is used to determine the fair value of our share-based awards.
We estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and subjective assumptions we make, including expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Due to the lack of an extended trading history of our common stock and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we base the estimate of expected stock price volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. The historical volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We use the simplified method to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees and directors. We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero, as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.
We determine the fair value of restricted common stock awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.
Series B Preferred Stock Tranche Rights
The tranche rights included in the terms of the Series B met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument, as the tranche rights were legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Series B. The tranche rights were initially recorded at fair value as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and were subsequently re-measured at fair value each reporting period and at settlement with changes in the fair value recognized as a component of other income (expense). Changes in the fair value of the Series B tranche rights were recognized until the tranche obligations were settled in full in September 2020.
While outstanding, the estimated fair value of the tranche rights were determined using a probability-weighted present value model that considered the probability of triggering the tranche rights through achievement of the product development milestones specified in the stock purchase agreement. We converted the future values to present value using a discount rate that we believed to be appropriate for probability-adjusted cash flows. The estimates were based, in part, on subjective assumptions. Changes to these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair value of the tranche rights.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations by period presented according to the payment due date at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1)
Represents future minimum repayments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office and laboratory space.
On December 29, 2020, we entered into a lease agreement, or the Lease, for approximately 33,518 square feet, or the Pod 4 Portion, and approximately 54,666 square feet, or the Pod 5 Portion, of a manufacturing facility located in Andover, Massachusetts. The Lease contains a free rent period for each of the Pod 4 Portion and the Pod 5 Portion. The term of the Lease will continue for 15 years from the date the monthly rent for the Pod 5 Portion commences, or approximately December 31, 2036, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Lease. We have two options to extend the term of the Lease for the entire premises for a period of 10 years each, with rent during the extended term being based on the then-prevailing market rental rate.
Under the Lease, the monthly rent payments for the Pod 4 Portion are expected to commence on October 1, 2021, reflecting an approximately nine-month rent-free period following the execution of the Lease. We have a right to occupy the Pod 4 Portion prior to the Pod 4 rent commencement date, subject to the completion of tenant improvements, and would be responsible for proportional base rent payments, utilities, and our proportionate share of operating costs and taxes attributable to the Pod 4 Portion, provided that such payments of base rent for the occupancy of the Pod 4 Portion would commence no earlier than July 1, 2021 in any event. Beginning on the Pod 4 rent commencement date, we will be obligated to make monthly base rent payments, which will initially be approximately $0.1 million and will increase to approximately $0.2 million during the initial term of the Lease. The monthly rent payments for the Pod 5 Portion are expected to commence on January 1, 2022, reflecting an approximately one-year rent-free period following the execution of the Lease. Beginning on the Pod 5 rent commencement date, we will be obligated to make monthly base rent payments, which will initially be approximately $0.2 million and will increase to approximately $0.3 million during the initial term of the Lease. We were also required to provide the landlord with a $2.9 million letter of credit as support for our obligations under the Lease. The total lease commitment under this Lease is expected to be approximately $72.0 million over the 15-year term.
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with vendors for preclinical and clinical studies, preclinical and clinical supply and manufacturing services, professional consultants for expert advice, and other vendors for other services for operating purposes. We have not included these payments in the table of contractual obligations above since the contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.
In addition, we have entered into license and royalty agreements for intellectual property with certain parties. Such arrangements require ongoing payments, including payments upon achieving certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, receipt of sublicense income, as well as royalties on commercial sales. Payments under these arrangements are expensed as incurred and are recorded as research and development expenses. We paid amounts under such agreements at the time of execution and pay annual fees. Upon the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial for ONCR-177, certain payments came due. We have not included the annual license fee payments in the table of contractual obligations above because the license agreements are cancelable by us and
therefore, we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. We have not included potential royalties or milestone obligations in the table above because they are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We are an ‘‘emerging growth company,’’ or EGC, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of the delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting standards as private entities.
As an EGC, we may also take advantage of certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an EGC:
∎
we are presenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report;
∎
we will avail ourselves of the exemption from providing an auditor’s attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
∎
we will avail ourselves of the exemption from complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis;
∎
we will provide reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
∎
we will not require nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments.
We will remain an EGC until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2025, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous rolling three-year period, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
We are also a ‘‘smaller reporting company,’’ meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the proposed aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us as of the date of our initial public offering is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company until (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million.
If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an EGC, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to EGCs, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect that any recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on our financial statements or will otherwise apply to our operations.
