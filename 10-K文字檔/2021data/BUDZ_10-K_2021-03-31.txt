Overview
We are an early stage holding company currently focused on the development and application of cannabis-derived compounds for the treatment of human disease. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sangre AT, LLC (“Sangre”), has begun a planned five-year Cannabis Genomic Study to complete a genetic blueprint of the Cannabis plant genus, by creating a global genomic classification of the entire plant. By targeting cannabis-derived molecules that stimulate the endocannabinoid system, Sangre’s research team plans to develop scientifically-valid and evidence-based cannabis strains for the production of disease-specific medicines. The goal of the research is to identify, collect, patent, and archive a collection of highly-active medicinal strains. We plan to conduct this study only in states where cannabis has been legalized for medicinal purposes.
Using annotated genomic data and newly generated phenotypic data, Sangre plans to identify and isolate regions of the plant genome which are related to growth, synthesis of desired molecules, and drought and pest resistance. This complex data set would then be utilized in a breeding program to generate and establish new hybrid cultivars which exemplify the traits that are desired by the medical and patient community. This breeding program would produce new seed stocks and clones, which we plan on patenting. If successful this intellectual property should generate immense value for the Company. After developing a comprehensive understanding of the annotated genome of a variety of cannabis strains, and obtaining intellectual property protection over the most promising strains, we plan move forward either independently or with strategic partners to develop medicinal products for the treatment of a multitude of human diseases.
Our current, short-term goals relate to the Cannabis Genomic Study and the resulting development of a variety of new cannabis strains, and, over the next 5 years, we plan to process those results in order to become an international cannabis research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brand focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade “Cultivation Centers” to consult, assist, manage & lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis with a concentration on the legal and medical cannabis sector.
Our long-term plan is to become a true “Seed-to-Sale” global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development, and real estate options in this new emerging market. Our long term growth may also come from the acquisition of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries, to make anything from infused beverages to super oxygenated water with CBD and THC. Currently, we have formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia to address this Global demand. We have also formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia, to address future global demand, however the entity has been dormant since its inception. We will look to conduct future research, marketing, import/exporting, and manufacturing of our proprietary products on an international level.
In furtherance of our current, short terms goals, Sangre initiated the cannabis genome project in April 2017, by extracting DNA from seven cannabis strains in Tucson, Arizona. Sangre followed the initial extraction with a second round of extractions in July 2017. The extracted DNA is currently being sequenced by the Sangre team using a binary sequencing approach based on the use of two distinct sequencing technologies and a proprietary bioinformatics database. Following the generation of genomic data, the sequences will be annotated (compared) against over 300,000 plant genes to elucidate specific de novo pathways responsible for the synthesis of specific compounds and classes of compounds.
Under the genome project directives, additional strains are slated for sequencing and annotation as part of the overall expansion of this research project. An integral part of this expansion is the acquisition of additional DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing technologies. The expansion also includes the installation of high-level IT networks for data acquisition, analysis, and storage.
On July 26, 2017, we acquired a property located in La Veta, Colorado in order for Sangre to complete its 5-Year, $15+ million Cannabis Genomic Study. The site includes a 10,000+ sq. ft. building that will house Sangre’s genomic research facility, a 4,000+ square foot building for plant product analytics and plant product extraction, a 3,500 sq. ft. corporate office center, and 25 RV slots with full water and electric, which we plan to convert into a series of small research pods. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $525,000 down, along with 25,000 shares of our common stock, and Sangre took immediate possession of the property. We were obligated to pay an additional $400,000 in cash and issue an additional 75,000 shares of our common stock over the two next years in order to pay the entire purchase price. To date we have spent $354,000 renovating the property and an additional $400,000 on extraction and analytical lab equipment. We plan to complete the property renovations by Q3 of 2019, at an estimated cost of $300,000. We will need additional extraction equipment and analytical lab equipment, totaling approximately $700,000. During the year ended December 31, 2019, construction in progress in the amount of $499,695 was fully impaired due to the Company may not receive funds to complete the research facility center project. There was no work performed in 2019. We will need to raise additional funds in order to complete the planned renovations and pay the purchase price for the equipment.
WEED Inc. acquired the property in La Veta, Colorado in order to facilitate the expansion of the genomic studies and the development of new hybrid strains. The facility is currently under re-design and renovation to convert the existing structures into a world-class genetics research center.
A gene-based breeding program will allow us to root out inferior cultivars and replace them with fully-validated and patentable cultivars which produce consistent plant products for the medicinal markets. The gene-based breeding program will improve cultivars and introduce integrity, stability, and quality to the market in the following ways:
● accelerated and optimized growth rates; modern genomic resources will enhance traditional breeding methods
● generate new cultivars, accelerating and perfecting the art of selective breeding
● provide the ability to assay for specific genes within the crop, establish strain tracking, and promote market quality assurance
● improved disease, pest, and drought resistance of the Cannabis plant
We believe the gene-based breeding program will facilitate and accelerate:
● improved therapeutic properties, i.e., increased THC/CBD concentration and the production of specific classes of oils and terpenses
● enhanced opportunities for new drug discovery
● accelerated breeding of super-cultivars: drought, pest, and mold resistant, increased %THC
● revenue generation through our unique ability to breed and genetically fingerprint new, super-cultivars: establish strong patent protection; and provide these cultivars to the market on a favorable cost and royalty basis.
Our goal with this program is to develop a translational breeding program to establish a new collection of Cannabis cultivars for the Colorado, national, and international markets. Through the use of genetic screening technology, cultivars can be up-selected for specific traits and grown to address the needs of consumers in the medicinal market.
Corporate Overview
We were originally incorporated under the name Plae, Inc., in the State of Arizona on August 20, 1999. At the time we operated under the name Plae, Inc., no business was conducted. No books or records were maintained and no meetings were held. In essence, nothing was done after incorporation until Glenn E. Martin took possession of Plae, Inc. in January 2005. On February 18, 2005, the corporate name was changed to King Mines, Inc. and then subsequently changed to its current name, United Mines, Inc., on March 30, 2005. No shares were issued until the Company became United Mines, Inc. From 2005 until 2015, we were an exploration stage mineral exploration company that owned a number of unpatented mining claims and Arizona State Land Department claims.
On November 26, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the redomestication of our company from Arizona to Nevada (the “Articles of Domestication”), and approved Articles of Incorporation in Nevada, which differed from then-Articles of Incorporation in Arizona, primarily by (a) changing our name from United Mines, Inc. to WEED, Inc., (b) authorizing Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of preferred stock, with blank check rights granted to our Board of Directors, and (c) authorizing Two Hundred Million (200,000,000) shares of common stock (the “Nevada Articles of Incorporation”). On December 19, 2014, the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock approved the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation at a Special Meeting of Shareholders. On January 16, 2015, the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation went effective with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On February 2, 2015, our name change to WEED, Inc., and a corresponding ticker symbol change to “BUDZ” went effective with FINRA and was reflected on the quotation of our common stock on OTC Markets.
These changes were affected in order to make our corporate name and ticker symbol better align with our short-term and long-term business focus. Our current, short-term goals relate to the Cannabis Genomic Study and the resulting development of a variety of new cannabis strains, and, over the next 5 years, we plan to process those results in order to become an international cannabis research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brand focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade “Cultivation Centers” to consult, assist, manage & lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis with a concentration on the legal and medical cannabis sector.
Our long-term plan is to become a true “Seed-to-Sale” global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development, and real estate options in this new emerging market. Our long term growth may also come from the acquisition of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries, to make anything from infused beverages to super oxygenated water with CBD and THC. Currently, we have formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia to address this Global demand. We have also formed WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., an Israeli corporation, to address future global demand. We will look to conduct future research, marketing, import/exporting, and manufacturing of our proprietary products on an international level.
On April 20, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Sangre AT, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, under which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership units of Sangre in exchange for Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144. As a result of this agreement, Sangre is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WEED, Inc.
This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included as part of this Annual Report.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Operating Loss; Net Loss
Our comprehensive net loss decreased by $23,465,700, from ($27,530,288) to ($4,064,588), from the year ended 2019 compared to 2020. Our operating loss decreased by $23,340,593, from ($27,417,067) to ($4,076,474) for the same period. The decrease in operating loss is primarily a result of our decreases in our professional fees and our general and administrative expenses. The decrease in our net loss is also a result of our operating loss decrease, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. These changes are detailed below.
Revenue
We have not had any revenues since our inception. Prior to October 1, 2014, we were an exploration stage mineral exploration company that owned a number of unpatented mining claims and Arizona State Land Department claims. In late 2014, we changed our short-term and long-term business focus to the medical cannabis sector. In the short-term we plan to conduct Sangre’s Cannabis Genomic Study over the next 5 years and process those result, and in the long-term is to be a company focused on purchasing land and building commercial grade “Cultivation Centers” to consult, assist, manage & lease to licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis, with a concentration on the legal and medical marijuana (Cannabis) sector. Our long-term plan is to become a True “Seed-to-Sale” company providing infrastructure, financial solutions and real estate options in this new emerging market, worldwide. We plan to make our brand global and therefore we will look for opportunities to conduct future research, marketing, import and exporting, and manufacturing of any proprietary products on an international level.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by $655,996, from $969,913 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $313,917 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to decreases in our travel and charitable contributions.
Professional Fees
Our professional fees decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our professional fees were $3,616,760 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $26,287,730 for the year ended December 31, 2019. These fees are largely related to fees paid for legal and accounting services, along with compensation to independent contractors, and increased primarily as a result of increased stock-based compensation awards and the value attributed to those shares of stock. We expect the amount of professional fees we pay in cash to grow steadily as our business expands. However, the amount attributed to the stock-based compensation could decrease in periods when our stock price is lower, if we continue to use stock-based compensation. In the event we undertake an unusual transaction, such as an acquisition, securities offering, or file a registration statement, we would expect these fees to substantially increase during that period.
Depreciation and Amortization
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had depreciation and amortization of $145,797, compared to $159,424 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 was related to properties and trademarks. The depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 was related to the sale of the two Audi vehicles as a repayment to Nicole Breen.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased from ($11,672) to ($40,828) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Our interest expense primarily relates to interest on short-term loans.
Other Income
In 2020, we had other income of $0 compared to $1,016 in 2019. The other income in 2019 related to a refund from a merchant.
Loss on Deposit
In 2020, we had loss on deposit of $0, compared to $100,000 in 2019. The loss on deposit for 2019 period was related to the termination of the exclusive license and assignment agreement between us and Yissum Research Development Company.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a gain on extinguishment of debt of $5,277, compared to $0 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2020 was related to shares issued for relief of payables.
Other Expense
During 2020, we had other expense of $0, compared to $1,956 in 2019. In 2019, the other expense primarily related to credit card finance charges.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, because of our operating losses, we did not generate positive operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2020 was $12,629 and our monthly cash flow burn rate was approximately $40,000. Our cash on hand was primarily proceeds from the sales of our securities. We currently do not believe we will be able to satisfy our cash needs from operations for many years to come.
Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are as follows:
Our current assets increased by $128,824 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in cash and deposits. The decrease in our total assets between the two periods was primarily attributed to a decrease in our property and equipment, net and depreciation of certain of our assets.
Our current liabilities and total liabilities increased by $184,308, as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. This increase in liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was primarily related to increases in our accounts payable, accrued officer compensation, accrued expenses, accrued interest, and notes payable, related parties, partially offset by a decrease in our notes payable, compared to December 31, 2019.
In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.
Cash Requirements
We had cash available as of December 31, 2020 of $12,629 and $2,509 on December 31, 2019. Based on our revenues, cash on hand and current monthly burn rate of approximately $40,000, we will need to continue borrowing from our shareholders and other related parties, and/or raise money from the sales of our securities, to fund operations.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operations
We had net cash used in operating activities of $430,987 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1,110,597 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
