ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 1, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has had material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and it is anticipated that this will continue for an indefinite period of time. The duration of the pandemic will ultimately determine the extent to which our operations are impacted. We continue to monitor our operations and have implemented various programs to mitigate the effects on our business including reductions in employees, labor costs, marketing expenses, consulting expenses, travel costs, various other costs, and capital expenditures, as well as reducing the amount of the cash dividend that we pay on our common stock and suspending and reducing shifts in our production facilities, temporarily furloughing employees, and implementing other cost reduction or avoidance initiatives.
During fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower revenues across all geographic regions. Our sales mix shifted towards more non-corporate office market segments as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced corporate spending impacting sales in the corporate office market. In 2020, consolidated net sales declined 17.9% compared to 2019 primarily due to COVID-19. As discussed above, the Company implemented, and continues to implement, various cost cutting initiatives to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on our operations. During 2020, the Company recorded $12.9 million of voluntary and involuntary severance costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We anticipate future annualized savings of approximately $15 million as a result of these separation initiatives.
During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of changes in macroeconomic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized a charge of $121.3 million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. See Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.
In response to the reduced demand and to enhance employee safety measures, we temporarily suspended production in our U.S. manufacturing facilities from March 18, 2020 to March 23, 2020, and then again from April 6, 2020 to April 13, 2020. We also substantially reduced production in our Craigavon, U.K. facility beginning on April 20, 2020 through the end of the third quarter, and our Thailand, China, and Australia plants were at times operating in reduced shifts in light of reduced demand. During the first quarter of 2020, our Asia-Pacific region was primarily impacted by COVID-19 due to government shutdowns in China and the temporary closure of our China plant in late January 2020 to February 9, 2020. In addition, almost all of our salesforce and administrative employees globally continue to work remotely in accordance with the Company’s ongoing safety measures, as well as any local government orders and “shelter in place” directives in place from time to time.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, government grants and payroll protection programs are available in various countries globally to provide assistance to companies impacted by the pandemic. The CARES Act enacted in the United States (see Note 17 entitled “Income Taxes” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information) and a payroll protection program enacted in the Netherlands (the “NOW Program”) provide benefits related to payroll costs either as reimbursements, lower payroll tax rates or deferral of payroll tax payments. The NOW Program provides eligible companies with reimbursement of labor costs as an incentive to retain employees and continue paying them in accordance with the Company’s customary compensation practices. During fiscal year 2020, the Company qualified for benefits under several payroll protection programs and recognized a reduction in payroll costs of approximately $7.3 million, which are recorded as a $6.1 million reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses and a $1.2 million reduction of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations, as the Company believes it is probable that the benefits received will not be repaid.
General
Our revenues are derived from sales of floorcovering products, primarily modular carpet, luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) and, starting in August 2018, rubber flooring products. Our business, as well as the commercial interiors industry in general, is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space. The commercial interiors industry, including the market for floorcovering products, is largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for their workplaces. In significant part, the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those corporations. As a result, macroeconomic factors such as employment rates, office vacancy rates, capital spending, productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general, also affect our business.
As noted above, our sales mix of corporate office verses non-corporate office market segments has shifted towards non-corporate office markets in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the corporate office market. We focus our marketing and sales efforts on both corporate office and non-corporate office segments, to reduce somewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely, as well as to capture additional market share.
Our mix of modular carpet and resilient flooring sales in corporate office verses non-corporate office market segments for the last three fiscal years is summarized below:
During 2020, we had net sales of $1,103.3 million, down 17.9% compared to $1,343.0 million in 2019, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. The operating loss for 2020 was $39.3 million compared to operating income of $130.9 million in 2019. Net loss for 2020 was $71.9 million, or $1.23 per share, compared to net income of $79.2 million, or $1.34 per share, in 2019. The 2020 period was impacted by a $121.3 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment loss recorded in the first quarter and $12.9 million of severance charges related to cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19. These charges were partially offset by $9.3 million of lower payroll costs due to furloughs and credits from payroll protection programs.
During 2019, we had net sales of $1,343.0 million, up 13.9% compared to $1,179.6 million in 2018. Operating income for 2019 was $130.9 million as compared to $76.4 million in 2018. Net income for 2019 was $79.2 million, or $1.34 per share, compared with $50.3 million, or $0.84 per share, in 2018. The 2019 period included the results of the acquired nora business for the full fiscal year, $5.9 million of purchase accounting amortization in connection with the nora acquisition, and $12.9 million of restructuring and other charges. The 2018 period included the results of the nora acquisition (described below) from August 7, 2018 through the end of the 2018 fiscal year.
On August 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of nora for a purchase price of €385.1 million, or $447.2 million at the exchange rate as of the transaction date, including acquired cash of €40.0 million ($46.5 million) for a net purchase price of €345.1 million ($400.7 million). Nora is an industry leader in the rubber flooring market, and the acquisition has expanded the Company’s presence within non-corporate office market segments since the acquisition date.
Restructuring Plans
On December 23, 2019, the Company committed to a new restructuring plan to improve efficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations, and more closely align its operating structure with its business strategy. The plan involved a reduction of approximately 105 employees and early termination of two office leases. As a result of this plan, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 of approximately $9.0 million. The charge was comprised of severance expenses ($8.8 million) and lease exit costs ($0.2 million). The restructuring charge was expected to result in future cash expenditures of approximately $9.0 million for payment of these employee severance and lease exit costs. The Company expected the plan to yield annualized savings of approximately $6.0 million. A portion of the annualized savings was realized on the income statement in fiscal year 2020, with the remaining portion of the annualized savings expected to be realized in fiscal year 2021.
On December 29, 2018, the Company committed to a new restructuring plan in its continuing efforts to improve efficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations, and more closely align its operating structure with its business strategy. The plan involved (i) a restructuring of its sales and administrative operations in the United Kingdom, (ii) a reduction of approximately 200 employees, primarily in the Europe and Asia-Pacific geographic regions, and (iii) the write-down of certain underutilized and impaired assets that included information technology assets and obsolete manufacturing equipment. As a result of this plan, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately $20.5 million. The charge was comprised of severance expenses (approximately $10.8 million), impairment of assets (approximately $8.6 million) and other items (approximately $1.1 million). The charge was expected to result in future cash expenditures of $12 million, primarily for severance payments (approximately $10.8 million). The restructuring plan was completed at the end of fiscal year 2020.
Goodwill, Intangible Asset and Fixed Asset Impairment
During 2020, we recognized a charge of $121.3 million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. See Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. During 2020, we recognized fixed asset impairment charges of $5.0 million primarily related to certain FLOR design center closures and other projects that were abandoned or indefinitely delayed. These charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Analysis of Results of Operations
The following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections.
Net sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 51% in 2020, 49% in 2019, and 49% in 2018. Because we have such substantial international operations, we are impacted, from time to time, by international developments that affect foreign currency transactions. In 2020, the strengthening of the Euro, British pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our net sales and operating income. In 2019, the weakening of the Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our net sales and operating income. In 2018, the strengthening of the Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our net sales and operating income.
The following table presents the amounts (in U.S. dollars) by which the exchange rates for translating Euros, British pounds sterling, Australian dollars and Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars have affected our net sales and operating income during the past three years:
The following table presents, as a percentage of net sales, certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations during the past three years:
Net Sales
Below we provide information regarding our net sales and analyze those results for each of the last three fiscal years. Fiscal year 2020 includes 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were both 52 week periods.
Net sales for 2020 compared with 2019
For fiscal year 2020, our net sales decreased $239.8 million (17.9%) compared to 2019. As discussed above, the decrease was primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 resulting in lower sales volumes globally. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a positive impact on our year-over-year sales comparison of approximately $7.1 million, meaning that if currency levels had remained constant year over year our 2020 sales would have been lower by this amount. On a geographic basis, we experienced sales declines across all our regions. Sales in the Americas were down 21.6%, sales in Europe were down 10.7% as reported in U.S. dollars, and sales in our Asia-Pacific region were down 17.7%.
The sales decrease of 21.6% in the Americas in 2020 was due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 and lower carpet tile sales volumes. On a market segment basis, the sales decrease in the Americas was most significant in the corporate office (down 33.8%), retail (down 34.8%), healthcare (down 15.2%) and education (down 8.3%) market segments, partially offset by increases in the residential living (up 23.8%) and public buildings (up 8.2%) market segments.
In Europe, net sales in the region decreased both in U.S. dollars (down 10.7%) and local currency (down 12.5%). The decrease in sales was due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 and lower carpet tile sales volumes, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the sales decrease in Europe was most significant in the corporate office (down 18.0%), hospitality (down 47.5%) and public buildings (down 14.2%) market segments, partially offset by increases in the transportation (up 40.3%), leisure (up 57.1%), healthcare (up 10.5%) and education (up 9.0%) market segments.
In the Asia-Pacific region, net sales decreased 17.7% primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 and lower carpet tile sales volumes. This sales decrease was partially offset by the strengthening of the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the sales decrease in Asia-Pacific was most significant in the corporate office (down 21.4%), retail (down 43.2%), healthcare (down 32.6%), hospitality (down 34.3%) and public buildings (down 20.3%) market segments, partially offset by increases in the leisure (up 63.5%) and education (up 15.5%) market segments.
Net sales for 2019 compared with 2018
For 2019, our net sales increased $163.5 million (13.9%) compared to 2018. As discussed above, the 2019 period included revenue from the nora acquisition for the full fiscal year. The 2018 period included nora revenue only from the acquisition date on August 7, 2018 to the end of the 2018 fiscal year of $112.6 million during that stub period. The increase in net sales was primarily volume related and not materially impacted by changing prices. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a negative impact on our year-over-year sales comparison of approximately $26.2 million, meaning that if currency levels had remained constant year over year, our 2019 sales would have been higher by this amount. On a geographic basis, including the impact of the nora acquisition, we experienced sales growth across all of our regions. Sales in the Americas were up 11.0%, sales in Europe were up 23.0% as reported in U.S. dollars, and sales in Asia-Pacific were up 8.5%.
The sales increase of 11.0% in the Americas in 2019 was due primarily to the impact of the nora acquisition and growth from our LVT products. The legacy Americas carpet and LVT business grew approximately 3.6% for the year. This increase in the legacy business was due to increased sales in the corporate office market segment (up 8.6%) as well as increases in the healthcare (up 18.2%) and education (up 7.6%) market segments. These legacy sales increases were partially offset by a decline in the retail market segment (down 24.6%).
In Europe, sales in the region were up in both U.S. dollars (up 23.0%) and local currency (up 29.1%). This increase was due primarily to the impact of the nora acquisition and growth from our LVT products offset by weakening of the Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. The legacy European carpet and LVT business declined 2.7% on a U.S. dollar basis, but grew 2.6% in local currency. The sales growth in local currency in the legacy European business was most pronounced in the corporate office segment (up 6.9%). The decline in legacy sales on a U.S. dollars basis was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar.
In Asia-Pacific, sales increased 8.5% primarily due to the impact of the nora acquisition and growth in our LVT products. This sales increase was partially offset by the weakening of the Australian dollar and lower sales in Australia. The legacy Asia-Pacific carpet and LVT business declined 3.9% on a U.S. dollar basis, but increased 0.1% in local currency. The sales decline in the legacy Asia-Pacific business was primarily in the corporate (down 5.7%) and government (down 17.9%) market segments, partially offset by increases in the retail market segment (up 12.0%).
Cost and Expenses
The following table presents our overall cost of sales and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses during the past three years:
For 2020, our costs of sales decreased $117.4 million (14.5%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower net sales. Currency translation had a $4.7 million (0.6%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. As a percentage of sales, our costs of sales increased to 62.8% in 2020 versus 60.3% in 2019, primarily due to changes in fixed cost absorption driven by lower production volumes due to the impact of COVID-19.
For 2019, our costs of sales increased $60.4 million (8.1%) compared with 2018. Included in 2019 are costs of sales for the acquired nora business for the full year, which includes purchase accounting amortization of $5.9 million related to acquired intangible assets. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a 1.8% positive impact on the year-over-year comparison. In absolute dollars, the increase in costs of sales was a result of higher sales for 2019 as compared to 2018, as well as the full year impact of the acquired nora business. As a percentage of sales, our costs of sales decreased to 60.3% in 2019 versus 63.6% in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to productivity initiatives and the nora non-recurring inventory step-up amortization which occurred in 2018, but did not recur in 2019.
For 2020, our SG&A expenses decreased $55.9 million (14.4%) versus 2019. Currency translation had a $1.5 million (0.4%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. SG&A expenses were lower in 2020 primarily due to (1) lower selling expenses of $54.8 million due to lower net sales, (2) $7.3 million of payroll expense credits related to COVID-19 wage support government assistance programs, and (3) $9.2 million lower performance-based compensation due to forfeitures and target performance measures not being met due to COVID-19. These reductions were partially offset by $12.9 million of severance expenses due to voluntary and involuntary separations, and a $5.0 million fine to settle the SEC matter as referenced in Item 8 Note 18 - “Commitments and Contingencies”. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased to 30.2% in 2020 versus 29.0% in 2019 primarily due to lower net sales.
For 2019, our SG&A expenses increased $56.1 million (16.9%) versus 2018. Included in the 2019 period were a full year of SG&A expenses for the acquired nora business versus only a stub period of approximately five months in 2018. Fluctuations in currency rates had a 1.5% favorable impact on SG&A expenses. The increase in SG&A expenses during the year was primarily due to (1) higher selling expenses for the full year impact in 2019 of the acquired nora business, (2) higher year-over-year legal expenses of $3.5 million related to the SEC matter discussed in Note 18 - “Commitments and Contingencies”, and (3) higher selling expenses related to bringing the Company’s global sales organization together for a meeting to accelerate the nora integration, advance our selling system transformation, and engage the sales force in the Company’s sustainability mission. These increases were partially offset by lower stock compensation expense of $5.8 million compared to prior year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased to 29.0% in 2019 versus 28.2% in 2018.
Interest Expense
For 2020, our interest expense increased $3.6 million to $29.2 million, versus $25.6 million in 2019, primarily due to (1) a $3.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt to amend the Syndicated Credit Facility and repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness thereunder, and (2) a $3.9 million reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income for deferred interest rate swap losses due to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts. These increases were partially offset by lower average interest rates on our borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility (our average borrowing rate for 2020 was 1.89% compared to 3.27% in 2019) and lower outstanding borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility compared to 2019.
For 2019, our interest expense increased $10.2 million to $25.6 million, versus $15.4 million in 2018. This increase was a result of higher outstanding borrowings incurred in August 2018 to complete the nora acquisition offset slightly by lower average interest rates on our borrowings (our average borrowing rate, including the impact of interest rate swaps, for 2019 was 3.27% as compared to 3.50% for 2018). Our interest rate swaps, entered into in 2017 and 2019, had approximately $0.2 million impact on interest expense for 2019.
Tax
For the year ended January 3, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $7.5 million on pre-tax loss of $79.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.4%. The effective tax rate for this period was significantly impacted by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken in prior years on discontinued operations. Excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions on discontinued operations, the effective tax rate was 14.1% for 2020 compared to 22.2% in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate, excluding the goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions on discontinued operations, was primarily due to the favorable impacts of amending prior year tax returns, retroactive election of the GILTI High-tax Exclusion in the 2019 tax return and reduction in non-deductible employee compensation. This decrease was partially offset by the non-deductible SEC penalty.
Our effective tax rate in 2019 was 22.2%, compared with an effective tax rate of 8.6% in 2018. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a nonrecurring $6.7 million tax benefit realized in 2018 related to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into law in 2017. In addition, there was a net increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 due to less U.S. federal and foreign tax credits which was partially offset by a reduction in non-deductible expenses, favorable change in unrecognized tax benefits and a higher portion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions not subject to U.S. state income taxes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
In our business, we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing costs, in addition to funding normal course SG&A expenses, anticipated capital expenditures, interest expense and potential special projects. We generate our cash and other liquidity requirements primarily from our operations and from borrowings or letters of credit under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes discussed below. We anticipate that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our obligations for the next 12 months.
Historically, we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year, as we pay insurance premiums, taxes and incentive compensation and build up inventory in preparation for the holiday/vacation season of our international operations.
At January 3, 2021, we had $103.1 million in cash. Approximately $1.7 million of this cash was located in the U.S., and the remaining $101.4 million was located outside of the U.S. The cash located outside of the U.S. is indefinitely reinvested in the respective jurisdictions (except as identified below). We believe that our strategic plans and business needs, particularly for working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements in Europe, Asia, and Australia, support our assertion that a portion of our cash in foreign locations will be reinvested and remittance will be postponed indefinitely. Of the $101.4 million of cash in foreign jurisdictions, approximately $13.7 million represents earnings which we have determined are not permanently reinvested, and as such we have provided for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes on these amounts in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
As of January 3, 2021, we had $285.2 million of borrowings outstanding under our Syndicated Credit Facility, of which $282.2 million were term loan borrowings and $3.0 million were revolving loan borrowings. Additionally, $1.6 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the Syndicated Credit Facility at the end of fiscal year 2020. As of January 3, 2021, we had additional borrowing capacity of $295.4 million under the Syndicated Credit Facility and $6.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under our other credit facilities in place at other non-U.S. subsidiaries.
On November 17, 2020, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Senior Notes”), which are discussed further below. As of January 3, 2021, we had $300.0 million of Senior Notes outstanding.
We have approximately $81.2 million in contractual cash obligations due by the end of fiscal year 2021, which includes, among other things, pension cash contributions, interest payments on our debt and lease commitments. Based on current interest rates and debt levels, we expect our aggregate interest expense for 2021 to be between $32 million and $33 million. We estimate aggregate capital expenditures in 2021 to be approximately $30 million, although we are not committed to these amounts.
It is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in November of 2025 and the Senior Notes, as discussed below, mature in December 2028. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes.
It is also important for you to consider that borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility comprise a substantial portion of our indebtedness, and that these borrowings are based on variable interest rates (as described below) that expose the Company to the risk that short-term interest may increase. During 2020, we entered into fixed rate Senior Notes (as described below) which reduced the amount of indebtedness subject to interest rate risk. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we terminated our interest rate swaps that were previously being used to fix a portion of our variable rate debt. For information regarding the current variable interest rates of these borrowings, the potential impact on our interest expense from hypothetical increases in short term interest rates, and the interest rate swap transaction, please see the discussion in
