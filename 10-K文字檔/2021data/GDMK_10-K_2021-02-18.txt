Discussion of the Years Ended 2020 and 2019
Revenues and Cost of Sales
Sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,660,726 compared to sales in 2019 of $1,317,092, an increase of $343,634 or approximately 26.1%. Our sales increases in the 2020 period is attributable to the addition of new customers, new products as well as increased sales to existing customers; offset by the impact of Covid-19.
Historically, the Company has relied on a small number of customers to generate a large portion of its revenue. In 2020, four customers accounted for 91% of the Company revenues. In 2019, the same four customers accounted for 91% of the Company’s revenues. Loss of any one of these four customers would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability and liquidity.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit was $660,815 or 39.8% of revenue compared to gross profit of $371,002 or 28.2% of revenue. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales (“gross margin”) is attributable to improved buying efficiencies at higher levels of revenue.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $26,821,661 compared to $492,031 for the same period ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 period includes a non-cash charge of $26,020,400 in stock-based compensation related to the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock with super-voting rights to the Company’s chief executive officer, and $168,529 in non-cash charges to professional expenses due to the issuance of restricted common shares to consultants and investment bankers, see Note 3. Capital Stock.
Excluding the charges of $26,020,400 and $168,529, operating expenses were $632,732 during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $492,031 or an increase of $140,701. This increase in 2020 is primarily attributable to increased advertising expenses of approximately $74,000 in the 2020 period to help support sales levels, increased warehouse storage charges of approximately $21,700; increased Amazon selling fees approximately $35,000 offset by reductions of approximately $35,000 in other general and administrative expenses.
Other income and (expense)
Other income and expense is comprised of other income items and interest expense. Other income was $5,785 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $29,955 in other expense during the same period ended December 30, 2019. The improvement in other income and expense of $35,740 is attributable to the recording of income for the forgiveness of $28,642 in PPP loans, 11,442 in employee retention credits related to the governments COVID relief plans offset by an increase in interest expense of $ 4,344 over prior year levels.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company had $62,555 and $22,291 in cash on hand, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $41,597 compared to $21,663 for the same period ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to a reduction in operating losses in 2020 (after deducting non-cash stock compensation expense) compared to the 2019 period; more than offset by an increase in inventory levels.
Cash flows from financing activities increased to $71,969 for the period ended December 31, 2020, compared to $22,439 during the same period ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net cash provided from financing activities is attributable to the receipt of $149,900 in government PPP and EIDL loans in 2020 compared to zero in 2019, offset by a net reduction in loans payable of $77,931 in 2020 compared to loans of $22,269 during the comparable period in 2019.
A large portion of the Company’s liquidity in 2020 was provided by the SBA COVID-19 loans thus allowing the Company to reduce its reliance on factoring. Additionally, in the second half of the year the Company became marginally profitable from operations compared to losses in previous comparable periods In the event the Company cannot maintain its profitability going forward, it will have to rely on additional factoring or other sources of financing such as debt or equity. There can be no assurances that other forms of financing on reasonable terms, or continued higher levels of factoring will be available to the Company in the future.
Seasonality
The Company’s business is not subject to seasonality.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Going Concern
The Company’s independent auditor has indicated substantial doubt about the Company continuing as a going concern based on the Company’s accumulated deficit and accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had negative working capital of $68,612 and had a stockholder’s deficit of $51,366.
The consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is in fact unable to continue as a going concern, the shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company.
