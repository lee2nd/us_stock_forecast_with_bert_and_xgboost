Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed below and as set forth under Summary Risk Factors and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Please also refer to the section under the heading “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are currently engaged in outdoor billboard advertising, surety insurance and related brokerage businesses, and broadband services businesses. In addition, we hold minority investments in commercial real estate management and brokerage services, a bank focused on servicing the automotive loan market, a homebuilding company with operations located primarily in the Southeast United States, and serve as sponsor of Yellowstone Acquisition Company ("Yellowstone"), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company ("SPAC").
Billboards. In June 2015, we commenced our billboard business operations through acquisitions by Link, our wholly-owned subsidiary, of smaller billboard companies located in the Southeast United States and Wisconsin. During July and August 2018, we acquired the membership interest or assets of three larger billboard companies which increased our overall billboard count to approximately 2,900 billboards. In addition, we have made additional billboard acquisitions on a smaller scale since that date. We believe that we are a leading outdoor billboard advertising company in the markets we serve in the Midwest. As of March 26, 2021, we operate approximately 3,200 billboards with approximately 6,000 advertising faces. One of our principal business objectives is to continue to acquire additional billboard assets through acquisitions of existing billboard businesses in the United States when they can be made at what we believe to be attractive prices relative to other opportunities generally available to us.
Surety Insurance. In April 2016, our surety insurance business commenced with the acquisition of a surety insurance brokerage business with a national internet-based presence. In December 2016, we completed the acquisition of UCS, a surety insurance company, which at that time was licensed to issue surety bonds in only nine states. UCS now has licenses to operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, over the last four years, we have also acquired additional surety insurance brokerage businesses located in various regions of the United States.
Broadband Services. In March 2020, we commenced our broadband services business with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of FibAire and provide these services to over 7,000 customers located in Arizona. On December 29, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the business assets of UBB and provide broadband services to over 10,000 subscribers throughout Utah. We hope to continue to expand in Arizona, Utah and other locales.
Investments:
●
Since September 2015, we have made a series of investments in commercial real estate, a commercial real estate management, brokerage and related services business as well as an asset management business. We currently own 30% of Logic and approximately 49.9% of 24th Street Holding Co., both directly and indirectly through our ownership in Logic. In addition, we have invested, through one of our subsidiaries, an aggregate of $6 million in 24th Street Fund I, LLC and 24th Street Fund II, LLC. These funds are managed by 24th Street Asset Management, LLC, a subsidiary of 24th Street Holding Co. and will focus on opportunities within secured lending and direct investments in commercial real estate.
●
In December 2017, we invested $10 million in common units of DFH, the parent company of Dream Finders Homes, LLC, a national home builder with operations in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and northern Virginia. In addition to its homebuilding operations, DFH's subsidiaries provide mortgage loan origination and title insurance services to homebuyers. In May 2019, we invested, through one of our subsidiaries, an additional $12 million in DFH through the purchase of preferred units with a mandatory preferred return of 14%. These preferred units were subsequently redeemed by DFH in 2020. On January 25, 2021, Dream Finders Homes, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DFH, completed its initial public offering and implemented an internal reorganization (the “Merger”) pursuant to which Dream Finders Homes, Inc. became a holding company and sole manager of DFH. Upon completion of the Merger, our outstanding common units in DFH were converted into 4,681,099 shares of Class A Common Stock of Dream Finders Homes, Inc., and one of our subsidiaries purchased an additional 120,000 shares of Class A common stock in the initial public offering. The DFH shares purchased in 2017 are restricted securities and are subject to a lock-up for a period through July 19, 2021 and subject to trading limitations under Rule 144 as we are currently deemed an affiliate of DFH as we own more than 10% of its Class A common stock. Prior to its initial public offering, we loaned DFH $20,000,000 to assist it in financing an acquisition which was consummated prior to its initial public offering. This loan was repaid in full with interest in early 2021.
●
In May 2018, we invested, through one of our subsidiaries, approximately $19 million through the purchase of common stock of CB&T Holding Corporation, the privately-held parent company of Crescent Bank & Trust, Inc. Crescent is located in New Orleans and generates the majority of its revenues from indirect subprime automobile lending across the United States.
●
In October 2020, our subsidiary BOC Yellowstone served as sponsor for the underwritten initial public offering of a special purpose acquisition company named Yellowstone. Yellowstone sold in its public offering 13,598,898 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and a redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of a share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Between August and November 2020, we invested, through BOC Yellowstone, approximately $7.8 million through the purchase of 3,399,724 shares of Class B common stock and 7,719,779 non-redeemable private placement warrants, each warrant entitling us to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. BOC Yellowstone as the sponsor of Yellowstone and under the terms of the public offering, owns approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding common stock. The purpose of the offering is to pursue a business combination in an industry other than the three industries in which we currently own and operate businesses: outdoor advertising, surety insurance and broadband services businesses. Yellowstone allows us to pursue a minority interest in larger companies in other industries without diluting the equity interests of our Boston Omaha shareholders. Yellowstone is currently focusing on acquisition candidates in the homebuilding, home materials, financial services and commercial real estate management industries but is also able to pursue acquisition opportunities in other industries.
In each of our businesses, we hope to expand our geographic reach and market share and seek to develop a competitive advantage and/or brand name for our services, which we hope will be a differentiating factor for customers. Our insurance market primarily services small contractors, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals required to provide surety bonds (i) in connection with their work for government agencies and others, (ii) in connection with contractual obligations, or (iii) to meet regulatory requirements and other needs. We have expanded the licensing of the UCS business to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In outdoor advertising, our plan is to continue to grow this business through acquisitions of billboard assets. We also expect to expand our broadband services in Arizona, Utah and in the future in other locations. We also expect to continue to make additional investments in real estate management service businesses, as well as in other businesses. In the future, we expect to expand the range of services we provide in the insurance sector, seek to continue to expand our billboard operations and broadband services and to possibly consider acquisitions of other businesses, as well as investments, in other sectors. Our decision to expand outside of these current business sectors we serve or in which we have made investments will be based on the opportunity to acquire businesses which we believe provide the potential for sustainable earnings at an attractive level relative to capital employed and, with regard to investment, we believe have the potential to provide attractive returns.
We seek to enter markets where we believe demand for our services will grow in the coming years due to certain barriers to entry and/or to anticipated long-term demand for these services. In the outdoor billboard business, government restrictions often limit the number of additional billboards that may be constructed. At the same time, advances in billboard technology provide the opportunity to improve revenues through the use of digital display technologies and other new technologies. In the surety insurance business, new insurance companies must be licensed by state agencies that impose capital, management and other strict requirements on these insurers. These hurdles are at the individual state level, with statutes often providing wide latitude to regulators to impose judgmental requirements upon new entrants. In addition, new distribution channels in certain areas of surety may provide a new opportunity. In the real estate management services market, we believe the continued growth of commercial real estate in many sections of the United States will provide opportunities for management services for the foreseeable future. We also believe our investment in both CB&T and DFH provides the opportunity for each company to significantly grow its business. We invest our available capital and the surplus capital from UCS in a wide range of securities, including equity securities of large cap public companies, various corporate and government bonds and U.S. treasuries. In broadband services, we believe that our Fiber to the Home, which we refer to as "FTTH", services can compete with traditional cable operators as broadband provides higher rates of transmission and improved speed to consumers and that, once built, other competitors may be less willing to compete in communities which we serve.
How We Generate Our Revenues and Evaluate Our Business
We currently generate revenues primarily through billboard advertising and related services, from the sale of surety insurance and related brokerage activities and by providing high-speed broadband services. Revenue for outdoor advertising space rental is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and advertising revenue is reported net of agency commissions. Payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue. In our surety insurance business, premiums written are recognized as revenues based on a pro rata daily calculation over the respective terms of the policies in-force. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired term of the policies in-force. In connection with our surety agency business, insurance commissions are recognized at a point in time, on a bond-by-bond basis as of the policy effective date and are generally nonrefundable. In our broadband business, revenue is derived principally from internet services and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract in the period the services are rendered. Revenue received or receivable in advance of the delivery of services is included in deferred revenue.
Segment gross profit is a key metric that we use to evaluate segment operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. We define segment gross profit as segment revenues less segment direct cost of services. In our billboard business, direct cost of services includes land leases, utilities, repairs and maintenance of equipment, sales commissions, contract services, and other billboard level expenses. In our surety business, direct cost of services includes commissions, premium taxes, fees and assessments, and losses and loss adjustment expenses. In our broadband business, direct costs of services includes network operations and data costs, programming costs, cell site rent and utilities, and other broadband level expenses.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, which we refer to as “fiscal 2020,” compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 which we refer to as “fiscal 2019.” Our results for fiscal 2020 include the operating results of our broadband services business which began during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Therefore, comparisons of our results for fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 may not be meaningful.
Revenues. For fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our revenues in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues were as follows:
We realized total revenues of $45,743,463 during fiscal 2020, an increase of 10.5% over revenues of $41,389,138 during fiscal 2019. The increase in total revenues was largely driven by our acquisition of FibAire in March 2020 as well as premiums earned at UCS, reflecting our ability to issue surety bonds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and prior year growth within our rental guarantee bond program. However, due to the current disruption in this market, we have suspended issuing new rental guarantee bonds, which could significantly reduce future revenues at UCS. We recognize revenues for written premium over the life of the surety bond and, as a result, increased sales activities are not fully reflected in the quarter in which the surety bond is issued.
●
Net billboard rentals decreased 0.6% in fiscal 2020, when compared to fiscal 2019, reflecting a reduction in rental and occupancy rates across a number of our markets due to COVID-19. The decline due to COVID-19 was partially offset by the acquisition of billboards from Image in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which accounted for approximately 4% of our billboard revenues in fiscal 2020.
●
Revenue from broadband services was $3,836,537 in fiscal 2020, mainly reflecting the FibAire acquisition completed in March 2020.
●
Premiums earned from our UCS insurance subsidiary increased 7.1% in fiscal 2020, when compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in premiums earned was primarily due to an increase in gross written premium now that UCS is licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and prior year growth within our rental guarantee bond program. However, due to the current disruption in this market, we have suspended issuing new rental guarantee bonds, which is expected to reduce future revenues at UCS. Revenues from our rental guarantee bond program accounted for $5,536,165 of UCS revenues in fiscal 2020. We recognize revenues for written premium over the life of the surety bond and, as a result, increased sales activities are not fully reflected in the quarter in which the surety bond is issued.
●
Revenue from insurance commissions generated by our surety brokerage operations decreased 4.7% in fiscal 2020, when compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease in commission revenue is primarily due to our agents placing more surety bond business through UCS but also due to a reduction in demand as some of the markets we serve (contractors, small businesses, residential and commercial lease) were impacted by COVID-19.
●
Investment and other income at UCS decreased 4.6% in fiscal 2020 from $448,327 in fiscal 2019 due to the decline in interest rates over the past year.
Expenses. For fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues were as follows:
During fiscal 2020, we had total costs and expenses of $49,769,517, as compared to total costs and expenses of $53,801,234 in fiscal 2019. Total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 108.8% in fiscal 2020 from 130.0% in fiscal 2019. This improvement reflects our increase in total revenues, a reduction in amortization expense due to extending the amortization period from three years to ten years for customer relationships within our billboard segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and our continued focus on reducing general and administrative expenses as well as professional fees. In fiscal 2020, cost of billboard revenues, cost of insurance revenues, employee costs, professional fees, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense decreased as a percentage of total revenues when compared to fiscal 2019. Loss on disposition of assets, bad debt expense and accretion, primarily associated with our billboard business, remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenues.
●
During fiscal 2020, cost of billboard revenues decreased $48,800, or 0.4%, when compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease was mainly related to lower ground rent expense and commissions paid and was partially offset by costs associated with the acquisition of billboards from Image in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
●
During fiscal 2020, cost of insurance revenues increased by $399,985, or 6.4%, when compared to fiscal 2019. The increase was mainly driven by increased loss reserves at UCS related to its rental guarantee bond program due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 which has led to higher losses and loss adjustment expense.
●
Employee costs in fiscal 2020 increased $1,095,493 from fiscal 2019. The increase was mainly driven by the addition of our broadband services business in March 2020 and was partially offset by lower employee costs within our billboard and insurance businesses.
●
Professional fees in fiscal 2020 were $3,530,278, or 7.7% of total revenues, as compared to $3,664,370, or 8.9% of total revenues, in fiscal 2019. Professional fees mainly include costs associated with third-party accounting, audit, legal, and acquisition related expenses.
●
General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 decreased $63,116 from fiscal 2019. The decrease was mainly driven by lower general and administrative expenses within our billboard and insurance businesses and was partially offset by the addition of our broadband services business in March 2020.
●
Non-cash expenses in fiscal 2020 included $3,987,003 in amortization expense, $3,704,700 in depreciation expense, and $140,704 in accretion expense related to asset retirement obligations for certain billboard and broadband assets. Amortization expense decreased by 61.9% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 as we extended the amortization period from three years to ten years to better reflect the estimated economic lives of our customer relationships within our billboard segment.
Net Loss from Operations. Net loss from operations in fiscal 2020 was $4,026,054, or 8.8% of total revenues, as compared to a net loss from operations of $12,412,096, or 30.0% of total revenues, in fiscal 2019. The decrease in net loss from operations in dollars was primarily due to increased revenue within our insurance operations, the addition of our broadband services operations, as well as a decrease in amortization expense after extending the amortization period from three years to ten years for customer relationships within our billboard segment. Our net loss from operations included $7,832,407 from non-cash amortization, depreciation and accretion expenses in fiscal 2020, as compared to $13,709,133 in fiscal 2019.
Other Income (Expense). In fiscal 2020, we had net other income of $4,522,518. Net other income included $5,701,909 in realized gains from the sale of large publicly traded equity securities mainly held at Boston Omaha, $5,187,159 in equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, interest income of $1,661,680 primarily derived from our DFH preferred units, interest on our short term loan to DFH, as well as from our investments in short-term treasury securities, and $1,074,539 in dividend income from public equity securities held by Boston Omaha. These items were partially offset by $8,260,941 from unrealized losses mainly on large publicly traded equity securities held by Boston Omaha as well as UCS and interest expense of $841,828 mainly incurred under Link's term loan which commenced in August 2019. During fiscal 2019, we had net other income of $10,930,831, which included $6,273,337 in unrealized gains on securities, $3,198,527 of interest income, $710,169 in dividend income, $572,181 in realized gains on disposition of investments, $479,366 in equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, and $302,749 in interest expense.
As a result of a change in GAAP effective in 2018, we are required to include the unrealized changes in market prices of investments in public equity securities in our reported earnings. As stated above, we experienced unrealized losses of $8,260,941 in the value of our securities during fiscal 2020. This contrasts with unrealized gains in the value of our securities of $6,273,337 during fiscal 2019. While we intend to hold our current securities for the longer term, we may in the future choose to sell them for a variety of reasons resulting in realized losses or gains.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders. We had net income attributable to common stockholders in the amount of $455,783 in fiscal 2020, or income per share of $0.02, based on 25,738,225 weighted average shares outstanding. This is compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1,486,923 in fiscal 2019, or a loss per share of $0.07, based on 22,778,405 weighted average shares outstanding.
The following tables report results for the three segments in which we operate, billboards, insurance and broadband, for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019:
Results of Billboard Operations
Comparison of Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, net billboard revenues decreased by 0.6% from fiscal 2019, reflecting a reduction in rental and occupancy rates across a number of our markets due to COVID-19. The decline due to COVID-19 was partially offset by the acquisition of billboards from Image in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which accounted for approximately 4% of our billboard revenues in fiscal 2020. Segment income from billboard operations improved mainly due to the reduction in amortization expense. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we updated our analysis of economic lives of customer relationships and extended the amortization period from 3 years to 10 years to better reflect the estimated economic lives of our billboard customers. The key factors affecting our billboard operations results during fiscal 2020 were as follows:
﻿
●
Ground rent expense as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 22.0% in fiscal 2019 to 21.7% in fiscal 2020.
●
Commissions paid as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 9.5% in fiscal 2019 to 9.6% in fiscal 2020.
●
Employee costs in fiscal 2020 decreased 4.2% when compared to the fiscal 2019.
●
Amortization expense in fiscal 2020 decreased by $6,022,671 from fiscal 2019. The decrease is primarily due to extending the amortization period from three years to ten years for customer relationships.
●
General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 decreased 13.5% when compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in travel related expenses as well as other cost savings initiatives due to COVID-19.
●
Net interest expense of $833,980 in fiscal 2020 compared to net interest expense of $251,657 in fiscal 2019. The increase in interest expense was related to Link's $18 million and $5.5 million term loans, which commenced in August 2019 and August 2020, respectively.
Results of Insurance Operations
﻿
Comparison of Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, total operating revenues increased by 5.3% when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 7.1% increase in premiums earned at UCS. Segment loss from insurance operations improved mainly due to lower operating expenses when compared to fiscal 2019. The key factors affecting our insurance operations results during fiscal 2020 were as follows:
﻿
●
Premiums earned from our UCS insurance subsidiary increased 7.1% in fiscal 2020, when compared to fiscal 2019, reflecting an increase in gross written premium now that UCS is licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and prior year growth within our rental guarantee bond program. However, due to the current disruption in this market, we have suspended issuing new rental guarantee bonds, which is expected to reduce future revenues at UCS as revenues from this product line accounted for $5,536,165 of UCS revenues in fiscal 2020.
●
Our brokerage operations realized a 4.7% decrease in insurance commissions from other insurance carriers in fiscal 2020,when compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease is mainly due to our agents being able to place more surety bond business through UCS but also due to a reduction in overall demand during fiscal 2020 as some of the markets we serve (contractors, small businesses, residential and commercial lease) were impacted by COVID-19.
●
Commissions paid in fiscal 2020 decreased by $645,504 from fiscal 2019 primarily due to the suspension of UCS's rental guarantee bond program, which generally provided a higher commission structure.
●
Our losses and loss adjustment expense as a percentage of insurance revenues increased from 13.8% in fiscal 2019 to 21.4% in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020, UCS increased its loss reserves related to its rental guarantee bond program due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19.
●
Employee costs and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 31.7% and 13.8%, respectively, during fiscal 2020. This is compared to 39.3% and 18.2%, respectively, during fiscal 2019.
●
During fiscal 2020, our segment loss from insurance operations of $197,377 was offset by gain on sale of investments of $269,701 from our investments in publicly traded securities. We expect to continue to invest a portion of our excess capital in accordance with insurance regulatory limitations in both large-cap publicly traded equity securities and bonds. These investments are subject to the risk of loss in value depending upon market conditions and factors outside of our control.
Results of Broadband Operations
Comparison of Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2019. In March 2020, we commenced our broadband services business with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of FibAire. In December 2020, we acquired substantially all of the business assets of UBB. Therefore, comparisons of our broadband results for fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 may not be meaningful.
Cash Flows
Cash Flows for Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019. The table below summarizes our cash flows in dollars for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5,573,281 for fiscal 2020 compared to a net cash inflow of $9,613,549 for fiscal 2019. The net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to improved operating results within our billboard and insurance businesses, the addition of our broadband services business, and interest income and dividend income earned at Boston Omaha, which was offset primarily by a decrease in unearned premiums at UCS and an increase in interest expense incurred under Link's term loan which commenced in August 2019.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $38,133,518 for fiscal 2020 as compared with net cash used in investing activities of $60,626,598 for fiscal 2019. The net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to our investments in U.S. Treasury trading securities, the purchase of certain billboard assets and easements in Nevada for $1,995,832, commencing our broadband services business with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of FibAire for a cash purchase price of $12,341,242, the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of UBB for a cash purchase price of $21,282,960, investing $6,000,000 in 24th Street Fund I, LLC and 24th Street Fund II, LLC, the $7,719,779 purchase of non-redeemable private placement warrants from Yellowstone and the $20,000,000 loan to DFH to assist in financing an acquisition. These investments were partially offset by DFH's $12,000,000 redemption of a portion of the preferred units as well as $25,499,884 in net inflows from sales and purchases of publicly traded equity securities mainly held at Boston Omaha.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $60,012,252 during fiscal 2020 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $49,241,242 during fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020, net cash provided by financing activities mainly consisted of $58,880,000 in gross proceeds raised through our public offering of Class A common stock on June 2, 2020, $5,500,000 borrowed under Link's credit facility on August 31, 2020, and gross proceeds of $669,751 raised through our “at the market" offering during April 2020, offset by offering costs of $3,428,355 and the purchase of the remaining thirty percent interest in SCS for $1,406,409.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Currently, we own billboards in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin, surety insurance brokerage firms we acquired in 2016 and 2017, a surety insurance company we acquired in December 2016, broadband services providers whose assets we acquired in March 2020 and December 2020 and minority investments in several real estate management entities, a builder of residential homes, and a bank holding entity whose primary source of revenue is in subprime automobile lending. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $44 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $38 million in U.S. Treasury trading securities. Our strategy is to continue to acquire other billboard locations and insurance businesses as well as acquire other businesses which we believe have the potential to generate positive cash flows and when made at what we believe to be attractive prices relative to other opportunities generally available to us. We currently expect to finance any future acquisitions and investments with cash, debt and seller or third-party financing. In the future, we may satisfy all or a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition with our equity securities. In addition, we have made investments in several companies and expect to continue to make investments in the securities of both publicly traded and privately held companies.
There can be no assurance that we will consummate any subsequent acquisitions. Furthermore, our acquisitions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including as to when, whether and to what extent the anticipated benefits and cost savings of a particular acquisition will be realized. Our failure to successfully identify and complete future acquisitions of assets or businesses could reduce future potential earnings, available cash and slow our anticipated growth. Although we have and continually enter into non-binding letters of intent to acquire businesses on a regular basis, we do not have current agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific material acquisitions which are probable to be consummated at this time.
In February 2018, we announced the entry into a stock purchase agreement relating to the issuance and sale of up to $150,000,000 of our unregistered Class A common stock, which we refer to as the “2018 private placement.” 3,300,000 shares were issued in the initial closing, which occurred on March 6, 2018, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $76,890,000. The remaining 3,137,768 shares were issued during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in a subsequent closing on May 15, 2018, resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $73,110,000. Under the 2018 private placement, all shares were sold at $23.30, a slight premium to the $23.29 closing price of the Class A common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market, as reported by NASDAQ on the date of the Class A Common Stock Purchase Agreement.
Since March 2018, we utilized our “at the market” offering that is part of our shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222853) that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC,” and declared effective in February 2018. This shelf Registration Statement, which authorized us to sell up to $200,000,000 through the sales of securities to the public, expired in February 2021. We sold a total of 2,630,787 shares of Class A common stock and raised gross proceeds of $60,120,165 under this shelf Registration Statement. We expect to file shortly a new shelf registration statement and, as a result, expect to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities, which would dilute the percentage ownership held by current investors.
On August 12, 2019, Link entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with First National Bank of Omaha (the “Lender”) under which Link may borrow up to $40,000,000 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Agreement provides for an initial term loan (“Term Loan 1”), an incremental term loan (“Term Loan 2”) and a revolving line of credit. These loans are secured by all assets of Link and its operating subsidiaries, including a pledge of equity interests of each of Link’s subsidiaries. In addition, each of Link’s subsidiaries has joined as a guarantor to the obligations under the Credit Agreement. These loans are not guaranteed by BOC or any of BOC’s non-billboard businesses. As of December 31 ,2020 Link had borrowed $18,060,000 through Term Loan 1 and $5,500,000 through Term Loan 2 under the Credit Facility. We may not borrow additional funds under the Credit Facility. Principal amounts under each of Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2 are payable in monthly installments according to a 15-year amortization schedule. These principal payments commenced on July 1, 2020 for Term Loan 1 and on October 1, 2020 for Term Loan 2. Both term loans are payable in full on August 12, 2026. During the first three years of the term loans, Link may prepay up to 10% of the loan principal in each year without paying any prepayment penalty. Otherwise, there is a prepayment penalty ranging between 2.0% and 0.5%. After three years, there is no prepayment penalty. Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2 have fixed interest rates of 4.25% and 3.375%, respectively, per annum. The revolving line of credit loan facility has a $5,000,000 maximum availability. Interest payments are based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.00 and 2.50% dependent on Link’s consolidated leverage ratio. The revolving line of credit is due and payable on August 11, 2021. Long-term debt included within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 consists of Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2 borrowings of $23,057,650, of which $1,282,504 is classified as current. There were no amounts outstanding related to the revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2020.
During the term of the Credit Facility, Link is required to comply with the following financial covenants: A consolidated leverage ratio for any test period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter of Link (a) beginning with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00, (b) beginning with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00, and (c) beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021 and thereafter, of not greater than 3.00 to 1.0; minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.00 measured quarterly, based on rolling four quarters. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2020.
The Credit Agreement includes representations and warranties, reporting covenants, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. Upon the occurrence of an event of default the Lender may accelerate the loans. Upon the occurrence of certain insolvency and bankruptcy events of default the loans will automatically accelerate. The foregoing summary of the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and Security Agreement, copies of which are incorporated by reference in this report and are attached as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively to our Form 8-K as filed with the SEC on August 13, 2019, a First Amendment to Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to our Form 8-K as filed with the SEC on October 29, 2019, and a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to our Form 8-K as filed with the SEC on June 30, 2020.
On March 18, 2020, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program which allows us to repurchase our Class A common stock. We have not yet repurchased any shares under this program and we cannot predict when or if we will repurchase any shares of Class A common stock as any such share repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including constraints specified in any Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.
On May 28, 2020, we entered into an underwriting agreement, which we refer to as the “underwriting agreement,” with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Cowen and Company, LLC, as joint lead book-running managers for a public offering of 3,200,000 shares, which we refer to as the “firm shares,” of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to an additional 480,000 shares of Class A common stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions, which we refer to as the “option shares.” Adam Peterson and Alex Rozek, our Co-Chairmen, together with another member of our board of directors and another employee, purchased, directly or through their affiliates, an aggregate of 39,375 shares of Class A common stock in the offering at the public offering price. On June 2, 2020, we announced the completion of the public offering for a total of 3,680,000 shares, including both the firm shares and all of the option shares issued as a result of the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option, resulting in total gross proceeds to us of $58,880,000. We raised this capital to fund the planned expansion of our fiber-to-the-home broadband business, to seek to grow our Link billboard business through the acquisitions of additional billboard businesses, and for general corporate purposes. The shares were sold in the offering pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222853) that was declared effective on February 9, 2018, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated May 28, 2020.
On October 2, 2020, we provided a term loan of $20,000,000 to Dream Finders Holdings, LLC to be used in expanding DFH's footprint in the Southeast United States. The effective interest rate on this term loan is approximately 14% and matures on May 1, 2021. This loan was repaid with interest in early 2021.
Between August and November 2020, we invested, through BOC Yellowstone, approximately $7.8 million through the purchase of 3,399,724 shares of Class B common stock and private placement warrants to purchase 7,719,779 shares of Class A common stock of Yellowstone. BOC Yellowstone is the sponsor of Yellowstone and under the terms of Yellowstone’s initial public offering completed in October 2020, which we refer to as the “Yellowstone IPO”, owns approximately 20% of Yellowstone’s issued and outstanding common stock.
We believe that our existing cash and short-term investments, funds available through the Credit Agreement Link entered into on August 12, 2019, and any funds that we may receive from cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next 12 months. We have also taken steps to suspend the future issuance of certain rental surety bonds issued by UCS and have taken other steps to reduce certain costs of our operations. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $44 million in unrestricted cash, $38 million in U.S. treasury securities and $64 million in marketable equity securities.
If future additional significant acquisition opportunities become available in excess of our currently available cash and U.S. Treasury securities, we may need to seek additional capital through long term debt borrowings, the sale of our securities, and/or other financing options and we may not be able to obtain such debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all.
In the future, we may use a number of different sources to finance our acquisitions and operations, including current cash on hand, potential future cash flows from operations, seller financing, debt financings including but not limited to long-term debt and line of credit facilities, including additional credit facilities which may or may not be secured by our assets or those of our operating subsidiaries, additional common or preferred equity issuances or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time, which could include asset sales and issuance of debt securities. In addition to our current credit facility, any other future debt that we incur may be recourse or non-recourse and may be secured or unsecured. Link's existing credit facility imposes restrictions on Link that could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our billboard and insurance industries. Specifically, these restrictions place limits on Link and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make additional acquisitions and investments, pay dividends, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate or transfer or sell our billboard assets. Our credit facility requires us to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio and other financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these loan covenants may be affected by factors beyond our control and a breach of any loan covenants would likely result in an event of default under the credit facility, which would permit the lender to declare all amounts incurred thereunder to be immediately due and payable and to terminate their commitment to make future extensions of credit. We also may take advantage of joint venture or other partnering opportunities as such opportunities arise in order to acquire properties that would otherwise be unavailable to us. Any future credit facilities which we or any of our subsidiaries may enter into would likely impose similar restrictions and risks. We may use the proceeds of any future borrowings to acquire assets or for general corporate purposes. In determining when to use leverage, we will assess the appropriateness of new equity or debt capital based on market conditions, including assumptions regarding future cash flow, the creditworthiness of customers and future rental rates.
We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business. We run the risk of inadvertently being deemed to be an investment company that is required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) because a significant portion of our assets consists of investments in companies in which we own less than a majority interest. The risk varies depending on events beyond our control, such as significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our subsidiaries, and transactions involving the sale of certain assets. If we are deemed to be an inadvertent investment company, we may seek to rely on a safe-harbor under the Investment Company Act that would provide us a one-year grace period to take steps to avoid being deemed to be an investment company. In order to ensure we avoid being deemed an investment company, we have taken, and may need to continue to take, steps to reduce the percentage of our assets that constitute investments assets under the Investment Company Act. These steps have included, among others, selling marketable securities that we might otherwise hold for the long-term and deploying our cash in non-investment assets. We have recently sold marketable securities, including at times at a loss, and we may be forced to sell our investment assets at unattractive prices or to sell assets that we otherwise believe benefit our business in the future to remain below the requisite threshold. We may also seek to acquire additional non-investment assets to maintain compliance with the Investment Company Act, and we may need to incur debt, issue additional equity or enter into other financing arrangements that are not otherwise attractive to our business. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we can make no assurance that we would successfully be able to take the necessary steps to avoid being deemed to be an investment company in accordance with the safe-harbor. If we were unsuccessful, then we would have to register as an investment company, and we would be unable to operate our business in its current form. We would be subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially adverse statutory provisions and regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, indebtedness, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. If we were deemed to be an investment company and did not register as an investment company when required to do so, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, and/or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which we were an unregistered investment company.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Our Board of Directors has not adopted a policy limiting the total amount of debt that we may incur. Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating the amount of debt that we may incur. If we adopt a debt policy, our Board of Directors may from time to time modify such policy in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general conditions in the markets for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock if then trading on any exchange, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors. Our decision to use leverage in the future to finance our assets will be at our discretion and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and we are not restricted by our governing documents or otherwise in the amount of leverage that we may use.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Except for our normal operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions or special purpose entities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
In the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following represent the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Purchased Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets
We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives, which range between two years and 50 years as follows:
Purchased intangible assets, including long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors considered in reviewing the asset values include consideration of the use of the asset, the expected life of the asset, and regulatory or contractual provisions related to such assets. Market participation assumptions are compared to our experience and the results of the comparison are evaluated. For finite-lived intangible assets, the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly to future cash flows is evaluated against our historical experience. Impairment losses are recognized only if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
We have acquired goodwill related to our various business acquisitions. Goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill, by reporting unit, is reviewed annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. For our annual review, we employ a third party valuation expert. Factors considered in the annual evaluation include deterioration in economic conditions (both macro and geographic), limitations on accessing capital, and market value of our company. Industry and market conditions such as changes in competition, the general state of the industry, regulatory and political developments, and changes in market multiples are additional components of the valuation. Changes in key personnel, strategy, and customer retention are also reviewed. If industry and economic conditions deteriorate, we may be required to assess goodwill impairment before the next annual test, which could result in impairment charges. The discounted cash flow approach that we use for valuing goodwill as part of the impairment testing approach involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Key assumptions utilized in estimating the future cash flows expected to be generated by each reporting unit primarily relate to forecasted revenues and premiums earned.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated our analysis of economic lives of customer relationships. As of October 1, 2019, we extended the amortization period to ten years to better reflect the estimated economic lives of our billboard customers. This change in accounting estimate decreased amortization expense and decreased the net loss by $2,124,125, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Acquisitions
For transactions that meet the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For transactions that meet the definition of a business combination, the determination of the final purchase price and the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized in the prior period financial statements. For transactions that meet the definition of asset purchases, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated relative fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset, adjusted for an estimated reduction in fair value due to age of the asset, and the economic useful life. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate, the timing and amount of future cash flows, the applicable income tax rates, and an appropriate customer attrition rate.
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates for the ultimate cost of unpaid reported and unreported claims incurred and related expenses. Estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on past experience of investigating and adjusting claims and consideration of the level of premiums written during the current and prior year. Since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may differ from the estimated reserve. The effects of changes in estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are updated.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
At December 31, 2020, we held no significant derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodity prices or other market price risks. Our operations are currently conducted entirely within the U.S.; therefore, we had no significant exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company’s management believes the impact of recently issued standards not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and improves consistent application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for other areas by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This guidance is effective January 1, 2021. We do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our disclosures.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Investments-Equity Securities, Topic 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This ASU clarifies that when accounting for certain equity securities, a company should consider observable transactions before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative. This guidance is effective January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements.
