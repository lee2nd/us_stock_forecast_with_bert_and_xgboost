Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. You should read the “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
OVERVIEW
We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that have the potential to optimize the delivery of infused therapies, advance patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Our strategy is designed to enable the subcutaneous administration of therapies that have previously been limited to intravenous, or IV, delivery. By moving delivery away from the high-cost healthcare settings typically required for IV administration, we believe our technology has the potential to reduce overall healthcare costs and advances the quality and convenience of care. Our lead product candidate, FUROSCIX, consists of our novel formulation of furosemide delivered subcutaneously via an on-body infusor and is under development for treatment of congestion in patients with worsening heart failure who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics and do not require hospitalization.
We resubmitted our new drug application, or NDA, for FUROSCIX, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on June 30, 2020. The resubmission was a response to a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA with respect to our NDA submitted in August 2017, which indicated that, among other things, certain device modifications to our infusor were required. Based on our interactions with the FDA, which required device modifications necessary to advance FUROSCIX using the existing technology, we decided to transition to our next generation device. The resubmission incorporated our next generation device which is being developed through a partnership with West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., or West, using its proprietary, wearable, SmartDose® drug delivery system (SmartDose is a registered trademark of West Pharma. Services IL, Ltd., a subsidiary of West, in the United States and other jurisdictions).
On July 23, 2020, the FDA accepted the resubmission of our NDA and we were given a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of December 30, 2020; however, on December 3, 2020, we received a CRL from the FDA, in which, among other things, the FDA raised questions related to testing, labeling and features of the combination product unrelated to the drug constituent. The FDA also indicated that they needed to conduct pre-approval inspections at two of our third-party manufacturing facilities that could not be conducted due to travel restrictions related to COVID-19 and raised questions related to testing, labeling and features of the combination product unrelated to the drug constituent. No clinical deficiencies were noted. On January 28, 2021, we had a Type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the issues described in the CRL and steps required for the resubmission of the NDA for FUROSCIX. Based on the meeting, we will run additional modified bench tests on aged commercial units of the West SmartDose Gen II on-body infusor and anticipate the FDA will still need to conduct pre-approval inspections at three of our third-party manufacturing facilities. We intend to resubmit our NDA in the third quarter of 2021.
We have funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2020 primarily through the sale of shares of our common stock and, prior to that, through the private placement of our preferred stock and the incurrence of debt. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our net losses were $33.0 million and $32.2 million, respectively. We have not been profitable since inception, and as of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was $161.7 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we develop the infrastructure to commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States, including building our sales and marketing organization, continuing research and development efforts, engaging in scale-up manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval for new product candidates and enhancements. We will need additional funding to pay expenses related to our operating activities, including selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
IMPACT OF COVID-19
A new strain of novel coronavirus which causes a severe respiratory disease (“COVID-19”) was identified in 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, affecting the populations of the United States as well as the rest of the world. In response to the pandemic, we transitioned our workforce to work from home in March 2020. In July 2020, we opened our offices for limited access to employees integrating all recommendations for workplace safety, including appropriate protocols to ensure social-distancing. The health of our employees remains a top priority and we are continuing to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and government regulations.
To date, the third parties that perform our manufacturing, assembly, packaging and testing of our products have generally remained operational. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the timing of our ability to resubmit the FUROSCIX NDA, the FDA’s subsequent review of the FUROSCIX NDA and our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, related restrictions on travel and transportation, the impact of new strains of the virus, the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and other actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, including the ability of the FDA to inspect facilities required for approval of our NDA, the impact to the business of our suppliers or customers, and other items identified under “Risk Factors”, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition.
COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development, or R&D, expenses consist of the cost of engineering, clinical trials, regulatory and medical affairs and quality assurance associated with developing our proprietary technology and product candidates. R&D expenses consist primarily of:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel expense and stock-based compensation expense;
•
cost of outside consultants who assist with technology development, regulatory affairs, clinical trials and medical affairs, and quality assurance;
•
cost of clinical trial activities performed by third parties; and
•
cost of facilities and supplies used for internal research and development and clinical activities.
We expense R&D costs as incurred. Given the emphasis to date on our lead product candidate FUROSCIX, our R&D expenses have not been allocated on a program-specific basis. In the future, we expect R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop new products and enhance existing products and technologies. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:
•
pursue regulatory approval of FUROSCIX incorporating the SmartDose drug delivery system;
•
continue to advance our pipeline programs beyond FUROSCIX;
•
continue our current research and development activity;
•
seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates;
•
initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
•
hire additional research, clinical and scientific personnel.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative, or G&A, expenses consist of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel expense and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance, commercial, human resources, facility operations and administrative functions. Other G&A expenses include pre-approval promotional activities, marketing, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, general corporate expenses and allocated facilities-related expenses.
If we receive FDA approval for FUROSCIX incorporating the next generation SmartDose drug delivery system, we anticipate that our G&A expenses will increase as we continue to build our corporate and commercial infrastructure to support the development and commercial launch of FUROSCIX in the United States.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in thousands):
Research and development expenses. R&D expenses decreased $6.5 million to $18.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $4.2 million decrease in device development costs, a $3.7 million decrease in pharmaceutical development costs, $1.7 million in unrecoverable component costs in 2019 related to the sc2Wear Infusor, and a $1.0 million decrease in severance costs. The decrease was partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in employee-related costs, a $2.2 million increase in supplies and contract services for clinical and medical affairs, a $0.4 million increase in quality and regulatory consulting and a $0.2 million increase in patent costs.
General and administrative expenses. G&A expenses increased $3.5 million to $11.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a $1.9 million increase in employee-related costs, a $0.8 million increase in public company costs, primarily related to directors & officers insurance, a $0.6 million increase in costs related to commercial preparation and a $0.6 million increase in legal costs. The increase was partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in severance costs.
Other income (expense). Other expense increased $20,000 to $4,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $16,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to the fair value adjustment to the derivative liability associated with the term loan with Solar Capital Ltd. and Silicon Valley Bank.
Interest income. Interest income decreased $1.3 million to $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our financial instruments during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest expense. Interest expense increased $0.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was due to the restructuring of the term loan in September 2019 with Solar Capital Ltd. and Silicon Valley Bank which increased the principal from $10.0 million to $20.0 million.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview
We have funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2020 primarily through the sale of shares of our common stock, through the private placement of our preferred stock and the incurrence of debt. From inception through December 31, 2020, we had received net cash proceeds of $92.7 million from our initial public offering in 2017, $56.7 million from sales of our preferred stock, $18.8 million from borrowings under our term loan, $13.5 million from sales of convertible notes, $50.2 million from our public offering of common stock in 2020 and $14.4 million from the sale of common stock in our at-the-market offering. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $72.0 million and short-term investments of $33.3 million.
We expect to incur substantial additional expenditures in the near future to support our ongoing activities and our plans to obtain regulatory approval for FUROSCIX incorporating the next generation SmartDose drug delivery system. We believe our existing unrestricted cash is sufficient to fund these operations through at least the next 12 months from the date of this annual report. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in the future as we prepare for and, if approved, commence U.S. commercialization of FUROSCIX, including the development of a direct sales force, and as we continue to make substantial expenditures on research and development, including to increase our manufacturing capacity and for conducting clinical trials of our product candidates. Additionally, we will incur additional costs as a result of operating as a public company. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the time and expense required to resubmit the NDA for FUROSCIX;
•
the potential FDA approval of FUROSCIX;
•
the costs and expenses of establishing our U.S. sales and marketing infrastructure;
•
the degree of success we experience in commercializing FUROSCIX, if approved;
•
the revenue generated by sales of FUROSCIX, if approved and other products that may be approved;
•
the pricing and reimbursement of FUROSCIX, if approved, and of other product candidates that may be approved;
•
the costs, timing and outcomes of clinical trials and regulatory reviews associated with our product candidates;
•
the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments;
•
the extent to which FUROSCIX, if approved, is adopted by the healthcare community;
•
the number and types of future products we develop and commercialize;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
the impact of COVID-19 on our operations; and
•
the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses.
Additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We may raise funds in equity, royalty-based or debt financings or enter into additional credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds through royalty-based financing arrangements, we will likely agree to relinquish rights to potentially valuable future revenue streams and may agree to covenants that restrict our operations or strategic flexibility. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur additional debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, delay clinical trials necessary to market our products, or delay establishment or expansion of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.
Loan and Security Agreement
In May 2017, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the “2017 Loan Agreement”), with Solar Capital Ltd. and Silicon Valley Bank (together, the “Lenders”), for $10.0 million. The 2017 Loan Agreement had a maturity date of May 1, 2021.
The interest rate under the 2017 Loan Agreement was the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 8.45%. The initial interest-only period was until November 30, 2018, followed by a 30-month principal and interest period. The First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement, entered into in November 2018, extended the interest-only period through May 2019. The Third Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement, entered into in May 2019, extended the interest-only period through August 2019, with the ability to further extend the interest only period to November 2019. Pursuant to the 2017 Loan Agreement, we provided a first priority security interest in all existing and after-acquired assets, excluding intellectual property, owned by us.
The 2017 Loan Agreement allowed us to voluntarily prepay all (but not less than all) of the outstanding principal at any time. In the event of prepayment, a prepayment premium of 1% would be assessed on the outstanding principal. A final payment fee of $250,000 was due upon the earlier to occur of the maturity date or prepayment of such borrowings. The final payment fee was increased to $325,000 in the First Amendment to the 2017 Loan Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $80,000, related to the amortization of the final payment fee associated with the 2017 Loan Agreement.
In September 2019, we replaced the 2017 Loan Agreement with a new $20.0 million term loan with the Lenders (the “2019 Loan Agreement”). The restructured four-year term loan facility allows for an expansion of the 2017 Loan Agreement. Some of the proceeds from the 2019 Loan Agreement were used to pay off the 2017 Loan Agreement including the final fee of $325,000. The 2019 Loan Agreement extends the term of the credit facility until September 17, 2023. The payoff of the 2017 Loan Agreement was treated as a modification of the debt. Debt issuance costs for the 2019 Loan Agreement, including unamortized issuance costs for the 2017 Loan Agreement, will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the 2019 Loan Agreement using the effective-interest method.
The interest rate under the 2019 Loan Agreement is the higher of (i) LIBOR plus 7.95% or (ii) 10.18% and there is an interest-only period until September 30, 2021. The rate at December 31, 2020 was 10.18%. Pursuant to the 2019 Loan Agreement, we provided a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions.
We entered into an Exit Agreement in connection with the 2019 Loan Agreement which provides for an aggregate payment of 4% of the loan commitment, or $800,000, to the lenders upon the occurrence of an exit event (the “Exit Fee”). We concluded that the exit payment obligation met the definition of a derivative that was required to be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. We recorded the issuance-date fair value of the derivative liability of $763,000 as a debt discount and as a derivative liability in our balance sheet. The derivative liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date and any changes in estimated fair value is recorded as other income (expense). We paid the Exit Fee during the year ended December 31, 2020 in conjunction with our public offering, which was deemed to be an exit event pursuant to the Exit Agreement. Prior to our public offering in 2020, we recorded $30,000 in non-cash expense as a fair value adjustment to the derivative liability.
As of December 31, 2020, unpaid borrowings under the 2019 Loan Agreement totaled $20.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $357,000 related to the amortization of the debt discount associated with the 2019 Loan Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $90,000 related to the amortization of the debt discount associated with the 2019 Loan Agreement.
The 2019 Loan Agreement allows us to voluntarily prepay all (but not less than all) of the outstanding principal at any time. A prepayment premium of 3% or 1% through the one-year anniversary and the two-year anniversary, respectively, would be assessed on the outstanding principal. After the two-year anniversary, a 0.5% prepayment premium would be assessed on the outstanding principal. A final payment fee of $500,000 is due upon the earlier to occur of the maturity date or prepayment of such borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $160,000 related to the amortization of the final payment fee associated with the 2019 Loan Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $46,000 related to the amortization of the final payment fee associated with the 2019 Loan Agreement.
In an event of default under the 2019 Loan Agreement, the interest rate will be increased by 5% and the balance under the loan may become immediately due and payable at the option of the lenders.
The 2019 Loan Agreement includes restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, change the name or location of our business, merge with or acquire other entities, pay dividends or make other distributions to holders of our capital stock, make certain investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, create liens, sell assets or pay subordinated debt.
At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement
On August 23, 2019, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (“ATM Agreement”), with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”) with respect to an at-the-market offering program under which we could offer and sell shares of our common stock (the “ATM Shares”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $15.0 million through Jefferies as our sales agent. The offering and sale of ATM Shares were made pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 11, 2019 (the “Registration Statement”). We agreed to pay Jefferies a commission equal to 3.0% of the gross sales proceeds of such ATM Shares.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold a total of 827,525 ATM Shares under the ATM Agreement, in the open market, at a weighted average gross selling price of $5.18 per share for proceeds of $4.2 million, net of commissions.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold a total of 1,502,892 ATM Shares under the ATM Agreement, in the open market, at a weighted average gross selling price of $7.13 per share for net proceeds of $10.4 million, which completed the program.
We incurred $189,000 of legal, accounting and other costs to establish and activate the ATM program. We charged $54,000 and $135,000 of these costs against additional paid in capital upon issuance of shares during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The program was completed in February 2020.
Sale of Common Stock
In May 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,780,347 shares of our common stock (the “2020 Offering Shares”), pursuant to the Registration Statement. The 2020 Offering Shares were sold at an offering price of $8.65 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $46.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. In addition, the underwriters of the offering were granted the option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 867,052 shares of common stock at $8.65 per share. In June 2020, the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 440,242 shares of common stock at $8.65 per share, resulting in additional net proceeds to us of $3.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
CASH FLOWS
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $27.7 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $32.2 million. This was offset by $1.4 million increase in net operating liabilities and non-cash charges of $3.1 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of right-of-use leased assets and non-cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount associated with the 2019 Loan Agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $30.4 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $33.0 million. This was offset by $0.4 million increase in net operating liabilities and non-cash charges of $2.2 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of right-of-use leased assets and non-cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount associated with the 2017 and 2019 Loan Agreements.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used by investing activities was $33.5 million, consisting of purchases of short term investments, net of maturities.
There was no cash from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $60.3 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds of $50.2 million from the public offering, net proceeds of $10.4 million from the at-the-market offering and $0.7 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. The proceeds were offset by the $0.8 million Exit Fee associated with the 2019 Loan Agreement and $0.2 million in tax obligations from the settlement of restricted stock units.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $13.6 million, consisting primarily of $9.6 million in borrowings under the 2019 Loan Agreement, net proceeds of $4.0 million from the at-the-market offering, and $60,000 in proceeds from stock option exercises.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
(1)
Consists of obligations under multi-year, non-cancelable building and equipment leases for our facilities in Burlington, Massachusetts and Lexington, Massachusetts. The building leases expire on November 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
We have drawn down an aggregate of $20.0 million from our 2019 Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2020. Our contractual commitments under the 2019 Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2020 consist of an aggregate of $24.1 million in repayment obligations, inclusive of related interest amounts and final fee in the amount of $500,000. See “-Loan and Security Agreement” for additional information regarding the 2019 Loan Agreement.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical trial sites and manufacturing organizations and with vendors for preclinical studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts and not included in the table above.
Due to the discontinuation of use of the sc2Wear Infusor, we have received notice of termination costs related to the program. We have accrued all costs for which we either believe we are contractually liable or for which we have negotiated settlement agreements in good faith. However, certain of our vendors have claimed or billed for additional costs for which we believe we are not obligated. At this time, we estimate that additional termination costs, if any, will be immaterial to our financial statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We are required to determine the fair value of equity incentive awards and recognize compensation expense for all equity incentive awards, including employee stock options and restricted stock units. We recognize this expense over the requisite service period. In addition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense in the statements of operations based on awards expected to vest and, therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We use the ratable straight-line method for expense attribution.
The valuation model we used for calculating the fair value of stock options for stock-based compensation expense is the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, or the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including:
•
Expected term. We do not believe we are able to rely on our historical exercise and post-vesting termination activity to provide accurate data for estimating the expected term for use in determining the fair value-based measurement of our options. Therefore, we have opted to use the “simplified method” for estimating the expected term of options, which is the average of the weighted-average vesting period and contractual term of the option.
•
Expected volatility. Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock prior to our IPO and a lack of company specific historical volatility, we have determined the share price volatility for options granted based on an analysis of the volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies. In evaluating similarity, we consider factors such as stage of development, risk profile, enterprise value and position within the industry.
•
Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options.
•
Dividend rate. We assumed the expected dividend to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so.
•
Expected forfeiture rate. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
•
Service period. We amortize all stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the same as the vesting period of the awards. We amortize the stock-based compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the expected service periods.
Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.
Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued R&D expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued R&D expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with R&D activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We base our expenses related to R&D activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct R&D on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the R&D expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future R&D activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
JOBS ACT ACCOUNTING ELECTION
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. This election is irrevocable.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
