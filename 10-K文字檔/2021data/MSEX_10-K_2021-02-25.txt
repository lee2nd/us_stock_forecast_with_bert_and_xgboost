ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.
The following discussion of the Company’s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
Management's Overview
Operations
Middlesex Water Company (Middlesex or the Company) has operated as a water utility in New Jersey since 1897 and in Delaware through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tidewater Utilities, Inc. (Tidewater), since 1992. We are in the business of collecting, treating and distributing water for domestic, commercial, municipal, industrial and fire protection purposes. We also operate water and wastewater systems under contract for governmental entities and private entities primarily in New Jersey and Delaware and provide regulated wastewater services in New Jersey and Delaware through five subsidiaries. We are regulated by state public utility commissions as to rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services, as to the quality of water and wastewater services we provide and as to certain other matters in the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate. Only our Utility Service Affiliates, Inc. (USA), Utility Service Affiliates (Perth Amboy), Inc. (USA-PA) and White Marsh Environmental Services, Inc. (White Marsh) subsidiaries are not regulated public utilities as related to rates and
Index
services quality. All municipal or commercial entities whose utility operations are managed by these entities however, are subject to environmental regulation at the federal and state levels.
Our primary New Jersey water utility system (the Middlesex System) provides water services to approximately 61,000 retail customers, primarily in central New Jersey. The Middlesex System also provides water sales under contract to municipalities in central New Jersey with a total population of over 0.2 million. Our Bayview system provides water services in Downe Township, New Jersey. Our other New Jersey subsidiaries, Pinelands Water Company (Pinelands Water) and Pinelands Wastewater Company (Pinelands Wastewater) (collectively, Pinelands), provide water and wastewater services to approximately 2,500 customers in Southampton Township, New Jersey.
Our Delaware subsidiaries, Tidewater and Southern Shores Water Company, LLC (Southern Shores), provide water services to approximately 52,000 retail customers in New Castle, Kent and Sussex Counties, Delaware. Tidewater’s subsidiary, White Marsh, services approximately 1,900 customers in Kent and Sussex Counties through various operations and maintenance contracts.
Our Tidewater Environmental Services, Inc. (TESI) subsidiary provides wastewater services to approximately 3,900 retail customers in Sussex Counties, Delaware.
USA-PA operates the water and wastewater systems for the City of Perth Amboy, New Jersey (Perth Amboy) under a 10-year operations and maintenance contract expiring in 2028. In addition to performing day-to day operations, USA-PA is also responsible for emergency response and management of capital projects funded by Perth Amboy.
USA operates the Borough of Avalon, New Jersey’s (Avalon) water utility, sewer utility and storm water system under a 10-year operations and maintenance contract expiring in 2022. In addition to performing day-to-day operations, USA is responsible for billing, collections, customer service, emergency response and management of capital projects funded by Avalon. Beginning July 1, 2020, USA began operating the Borough of Highland Park, New Jersey’s (Highland Park) water and wastewater systems under a 10-year operations and maintenance contract. Under a marketing agreement with HomeServe, USA offers residential customers in New Jersey and Delaware water and wastewater related services and home maintenance programs. HomeServe is a leading national provider of such home maintenance service programs. USA receives a service fee for the billing, cash collection and other administrative matters associated with HomeServe’s service contracts. USA also provides unregulated water and wastewater services under contract with several New Jersey municipalities.
Recent Developments
Capital Construction Program - The Company’s multi-year capital construction program encompasses numerous projects designed to upgrade and replace utility infrastructure as well as enhance the integrity and reliability of assets to better serve the current and future generations of water and wastewater customers. The Company plans to invest approximately $134 million in 2021 in connection with this plan for projects that include, but are not limited to:
•
Completion of construction of a facility to provide an enhanced treatment process at the Company’s largest water treatment plant in Edison, New Jersey to mitigate the formation of disinfection by-products that can develop during the water treatment process, as well as other improvements;
•
Construction of a facility to provide an enhanced treatment process at the Company’s largest wellfield in South Plainfield, New Jersey to comply with new state water quality regulations relative to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, collectively referred to as PFAS, and integrate surge protection to mitigate spikes in water pressures along with enhancements to corrosion control and chlorination processes;
•
Renovations and related construction at our 37-year old Middlesex Operations facility in New Jersey, including more efficient work space to meet the evolved needs of the business, enhancements to information technology infrastructure, improved energy efficiency and regulatory requirements;
•
Replacement of approximately four miles of water mains including service lines, valves, fire hydrants and meters in Metuchen, New Jersey; and
Index
•
Construction of a new upgraded wastewater treatment plant to serve our customers in the Town of Milton, Delaware.
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) - On March 13, 2020, the United States had declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. The ongoing impact on changing economic conditions due to COVID-19 continues to be uncertain and could affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in the future. While the Company’s operations and capital construction program have not been significantly disrupted to-date from COVID-19, we are unable to assess with certainty the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, our customers and our vendors prospectively, due to numerous uncertainties, including the continued severity and duration of the pandemic, sufficiency of the government’s vaccination program and actions which could potentially be taken by federal or state governmental and/or regulatory authorities.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Delaware Public Service Commission (DEPSC) have allowed for potential future recovery of COVID-19 related incremental costs through customer rates by the regulated utilities under their respective jurisdictions. Neither jurisdiction has yet to establish a timetable or definitive formal procedures for seeking cost recovery. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and evaluate its impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Contract Operations - In May 2020,USA, through a competitive bidding process, was awarded a ten-year, $8.3 million contract to operate and maintain Highland Park’s water and wastewater systems. The contract commenced July 1, 2020.
Private Placement Loan - In November 2020, Middlesex closed on a $40.0 million, 2.90% private placement loan with a maturity date of November 2050 by issuing first mortgage bonds (FMBs). Proceeds were used to reduce the Company’s existing short-term borrowings under its lines of credit and for the Company’s 2020 capital program.
Twin Lakes Utilities, Inc. (Twin Lakes) - Twin Lakes provides water services to approximately 115 residential customers in Shohola, Pennsylvania. In 2020, Twin Lakes filed a petition requesting the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PAPUC) to exercise its discretion under Section 529 of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code (the Code) to order the acquisition of Twin Lakes by a public utility as defined by the Code. The PAPUC assigned an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to adjudicate the matter and submit a decision to the PAPUC. Pre-filed testimony was submitted by all parties and an evidentiary hearing was held by the ALJ in early January 2021. The briefing schedule concluded on February 25, 2021 and a decision by the ALJ is expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2021. A final PAPUC Order on this matter is expected to also be issued during the second quarter of 2021. Separately, in January 2021, the PAPUC issued an Order appointing a large Pennsylvania based investor-owned water utility as the receiver (the Receiver Utility) of the Twin Lakes system effective January 15, 2021 with the receivership to remain in place until the final outcome of the Section 529 proceeding. In connection with this receivership, the Receiver Utility’s responsibilities will include operating and maintaining the system assets in compliance with all state, federal and local laws and regulations, maintaining existing or necessary permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations, orders, consents, registrations or filings, providing a list of recommended capital improvements, providing all supervision and personnel necessary and responding to system emergencies by taking necessary action to ensure the continued provision of adequate, efficient, safe and reasonable service. We cannot predict whether the PAPUC will ultimately approve or deny the Section 529 petition. Twin Lakes’ PAPUC-approved annual revenues and rate base are currently set at $0.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and its financial results, total assets and financial obligations are not material to the Company.
Index
Strategy for Growth
Our strategy for profitable growth is focused on the following key areas:
•
Invest in projects, products and services that complement our core water and wastewater competencies;
•
Timely and adequate recovery of infrastructure investments and other costs to maintain service quality;
•
Prudent acquisitions of investor and municipally-owned water and wastewater utilities; and
•
Operation of municipal and industrial water and wastewater systems on a contract basis which meet our risk profile.
Rates
Middlesex - In November 2020, Middlesex filed a petition with the NJBPU seeking approval to reset its Purchased Water Adjustment Clause (PWAC) tariff rate currently in effect to recover additional costs of $1.1 million for the purchase of treated water from a non-affiliated regulated water utility regulated by the NJBPU. A PWAC is a rate mechanism that allows for recovery of increased purchased water costs between base rate case filings. The PWAC is reset to zero once those increased costs are included in base rates. We cannot predict whether the NJBPU will ultimately approve, deny or reduce the amount of our request.
In March 2020, the NJBPU approved Middlesex’s petition to reset its PWAC tariff rate to recover additional costs of $0.6 million for the purchase of treated water from a non-affiliated water utility regulated by the NJBPU. The new PWAC rate became effective on April 4, 2020.
In March 2018, Middlesex’s petition to the NJBPU seeking permission to increase its base water rates was concluded, based on a negotiated settlement, resulting in an increase in annual operating revenues of $5.5 million. The approved base water rates were designed to recover increased operating costs as well as a return on invested capital in rate base of $245.5 million, based on an authorized return on common equity of 9.6%. As part of the settlement, Middlesex received approval for regulatory accounting treatment of accumulated deferred income tax benefits associated with required adoption of tangible property regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The settlement agreement allowed for a four-year amortization period for $28.7 million of deferred income tax benefits as well as prospective recognition of the income tax benefits for the immediate deduction of repair costs on tangible property. The rate increase became effective April 1, 2018.
Tidewater Rate Matters
Effective January 1, 2021, Tidewater increased its DEPSC-approved Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) rate, which is expected to generate revenues of approximately $0.6 million annually. A DSIC is a rate-mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investments in, and generate a return on, qualifying capital improvements made between base rate proceedings.
Effective March 1, 2019, Tidewater received approval from the DEPSC to reduce its rates to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), resulting in a 3.35% rate decrease for certain customer classes.
Pinelands Rate Matters
Effective November 4, 2019, Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater received approval from the NJBPU to increase its base rates by $0.5 million. The increased revenues were necessitated by capital infrastructure investments both companies had made and increased operations and maintenance costs.
Southern Shores Rate Matters
Effective January 1, 2020, the DEPSC approved the renewal of a multi-year agreement for water service to a 2,200 unit condominium community in Sussex County, Delaware. Under the agreement, current rates will remain in effect until December 31, 2024, but should there be unanticipated capital expenditures or regulatory related changes in operating expenses exceeding certain thresholds during this time period, rates are permitted to be adjusted to reflect such cost changes. Thereafter, rate increases, if any, cannot exceed the lesser of the regional Consumer Price Index or 3%. The new agreement expires on December 31, 2029.
Index
Outlook
Our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on four factors: weather, adequate and timely rate relief, effective cost management and customer growth (which are evident in comparison discussions in the Results of Operations section below). Weather patterns which can result in lower customer demand for water may occur in 2021. As operating costs are anticipated to increase in 2021 in a variety of categories, we continue to implement plans to further streamline operations and further reduce, and mitigate increases in, operating costs. Changes in customer water usage habits, as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, are significant factors in determining the timing and extent of rate increase requests.
An additional factor that may affect our outlook in 2021 is the impact of COVID-19 on the general economy and the resulting impact on our customers. For example, while many commercial and industrial business operations have curtailed operations as a result of COVID-19 in the respective states in which we operate, potentially resulting in lower water demand for those classes of customer, usage by residential customers has increased due to remote working arrangements (for further discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, see Recent Developments, Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) above). In addition, our customer collection efforts for Middlesex and Pinelands have been suspended based on State of Emergency Orders (SEOs). Meanwhile, these SEOs have declared utility construction projects to be essential and therefore, are allowed to continue subject to nationally-established COVID-19 safety precautions.
Organic residential customer growth for our Tidewater system is expected to be comparable to that experienced in 2020, which was approximately 5%.
The Company has projected it will spend approximately $314 million for its 2021-2023 capital investment program, including approximately $18 million for the upgrade of Middlesex’s primary water treatment plant in New Jersey, $43 million on our RENEW Program, our ongoing initiative to replace water mains in the Middlesex System, $38 million for wellfield treatment upgrades in the Middlesex System and $14 million for construction of a new replacement wastewater treatment plant in Milton, Delaware.
Operating Results by Segment
The Company has two operating segments, Regulated and Non-Regulated. Our Regulated segment contributed approximately 91%, 91% and 88% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively and approximately 93%, 93% and 93% of net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The discussion of the Company’s results of operations is on a consolidated basis and includes significant factors by subsidiary. The segments in the tables included below are comprised of the following companies: Regulated- Middlesex, Tidewater, Pinelands, Southern Shores, TESI and Twin Lakes; Non-Regulated- USA, USA-PA, and White Marsh.
Index
Results of Operations for 2020 as Compared to 2019
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $7.0 million from the same period in 2019 due to the following factors:
•
Middlesex System revenues increased $3.1 million due to increased customer water consumption resulting from increased demand from our residential and wholesale contract customers;
•
Tidewater System revenues increased $2.9 million due to additional customers and related residential developer connection fees;
•
Pinelands revenues increased $0.5 million due to the base rate increase that went into effect in November 2019;
•
Non-regulated revenues increased $0.3 million due to USA’s new contract to operate and maintain the Highland Park’s water and wastewater systems (for further information, see discussion under Recent Developments-Contract Operations) and increased supplemental services under existing contracts; and
•
All other revenue categories increased $0.2 million.
Operation and Maintenance Expense
Operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.8 million from the same period in 2019 due to the following factors:
•
Variable production costs increased $1.7 million due to higher customer water consumption and higher treatment costs due to weather-impacted changes in raw water quality;
•
Retirement benefit plan expenses increased $0.8 million primarily due to higher actuarially-determined retirement benefit plan service expense;
•
Bad debt expense increased $0.4 million due to expected increases in future write-offs due to COVID-19; and
•
All other operation and maintenance expense categories decreased $0.1 million.
Depreciation
Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $1.8 million from the same period in 2019 due to a higher level of utility plant in service.
Index
Other Taxes
Other taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $0.5 million from the same period in 2019 primarily due to higher revenue related taxes on increased revenues in our Middlesex system.
Other Income, net
Other Income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $1.9 million from the same period in 2019 primarily due to higher Allowance for Funds Used During Construction resulting from a higher level of capital projects in progress and lower actuarially-determined non-service expense for our employee retirement benefit plans partially offset by higher new business development costs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $0.2 million from the same period in 2019 due to higher average balance of debt outstanding partially offset by lower average interest rates on both long-term and short-term borrowings.
Income Taxes
The benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased overall by $1.0 million from the same period in 2019, primarily due to the regulatory accounting treatment of tax benefits associated with repair expenditures on tangible property owned by Middlesex, partially offset by higher pre-tax income.
Net Income and Earnings Per Share
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $4.5 million as compared with the same period in 2019. Basic earnings per share were $2.19 and $2.02 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Diluted earnings per share were $2.18 and $2.01 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Results of Operations for 2019 as Compared to 2018
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3.5 million from the same period in 2018. This decrease was related to the following factors:
•
Middlesex System total revenues remained consistent with the same period in 2018 due to the following:
Index
o
Reduced water consumption related to lower demand from our industrial and contract customers, resulting in reduced revenues of $1.2 million; and
o
An NJBPU-approved base rate increase, implemented in April 2018, resulted in higher revenues of $1.2 million;
•
Tidewater System revenues increased $1.0 million primarily due to additional customers, but was mitigated by reduced base tariff rates as approved by the DEPSC in March 2019. The lower rate was prompted by the lower corporate income tax rate enacted under the Tax Act. There is a corresponding decrease in income tax expense; and
•
Non-regulated revenues decreased $4.6 million, primarily due to changes resulting from USA-PA’s new 10-year contract with Perth Amboy. Under the new contract, effective January 1, 2019, USA-PA has direct management control for wastewater services, for which USA-PA is compensated. Under the prior contract, USA-PA utilized, and was compensated for, subcontracted wastewater services. Elimination of these subcontracted wastewater services resulted in a related decrease in operations and maintenance expense along with an increase in operating margin; and
•
All other operating revenue categories increased $0.1 million.
Operation and Maintenance Expense
Operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3.6 million from the same period in 2018, primarily related to the following factors:
•
Operation and maintenance expenses in our non-regulated subsidiaries decreased $5.2 million, primarily due to our new Perth Amboy operating contract, effective January 1, 2019, under which USA-PA no longer incurs sub-contractor fees for wastewater services. This results in a related decrease in operating revenues along with an increase in operating margin;
•
Retirement benefit plan expenses decreased $0.4 million primarily due to lower actuarially-determined retirement benefit plan service expense;
•
Labor costs increased $2.1 million due to increased headcount, increased average labor rates and payments relative to certain retiring employees; and
•
All other operation and maintenance expense categories decreased $0.1 million.
Depreciation
Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $1.7 million from the same period in 2018 due to a higher level of utility plant in service.
Other Taxes
Other taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $0.1 million from the same period in 2018 primarily due to higher payroll taxes offset by lower revenue related taxes on lower revenues in our Middlesex system.
Other Income, net
Other Income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $0.5 million from the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher actuarially-determined non-service expense for our employee retirement benefit plans, White Marsh contract compliance costs, TESI business development costs and the sale of wastewater franchise rights by our TESI subsidiary in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by higher Allowance for Funds Used During Construction resulting from a higher level of capital construction projects in progress.
Interest Charges
Interest charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $0.5 million from the same period in 2018 due to higher average debt outstanding in 2019 as compared to 2018 partially offset by lower interest assessment from the IRS examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns.
Index
Income Taxes
Income taxes for year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $4.1 million from the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower pre-tax income and the regulatory accounting treatment of tax benefits associated with repair expenditures on tangible property owned by Middlesex. In addition, Tidewater’s effective income tax rate was decreased in March 2019, reflecting the rate reduction approved by the DEPSC to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate resulting from implementation of the 2017 Tax Act. This has resulted in a corresponding decrease in operating revenues.
Net Income and Earnings Per Share
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $1.4 million as compared with the same period in 2018. Basic earnings per share were $2.02 and $1.97 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Diluted earnings per share were $2.01 and $1.96 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities are largely influenced by four factors: weather, adequate and timely rate increases, effective cost management and customer growth. The effect of those factors on net income is discussed in the Results of Operations section above.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows from operating activities increased $17.3 million to $53.4 million. The increase in cash flows from operating activities primarily resulted from reduced income tax payments, timing of vendor payments and higher net income.
Increases in certain operating costs impact our liquidity and capital resources. We continually monitor the need for timely rate filing to minimize the lag between the time we experience increased operating costs and capital expenditures and the time we receive appropriate rate relief. There can be no assurances however that our regulated subsidiaries’ respective utility commissions will approve base water and/or wastewater rate increase requests in whole or in part or when the decisions will be rendered.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in investing activities increased $16.5 million to $105.6 million, which was attributable to higher utility plant expenditures.
For further discussion on the Company’s future capital expenditures and expected funding sources, see “Capital Expenditures and Commitments” below.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $77.7 million to $16.2 million. The decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities is due to net lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and common stock and a reduction in net short-term bank borrowings.
For further discussion on the Company’s short-term and long-term debt, see “Sources of Liquidity” below.
Capital Expenditures and Commitments
To fund our capital program, we use internally generated funds, short-term and long-term debt borrowings, proceeds from sales of common stock under the Investment Plan and, when market conditions are favorable, proceeds from sales to the public of our common stock.
Index
The table below summarizes our estimated capital expenditures for the years 2021-2023.
Our estimated capital expenditures for the items listed above are primarily comprised of the following:
•
Distribution/Network System - Projects associated with replacement, installation and relocation of water mains and service lines and wastewater collection systems, construction of water storage tanks, installation and replacement of hydrants, meters and meter pits and our RENEW Program. RENEW is our ongoing initiative to replace water mains in the Middlesex System. In connection with our RENEW Program, we expect to spend approximately $11 million in 2021, $13 million in 2022 and $11 million in 2023.
•
Production System - Projects associated with our water production and water/wastewater treatment plants, including $18 million of expenditures in 2021 for the upgrade of the Carl J. Olsen (CJO) water treatment plant, $38 million of expenditures between 2021 and 2022 for wellfield treatment upgrades in our Middlesex System and $14 million of expenditures between 2021 and 2022 for construction of a new replacement wastewater treatment plant in Milton, Delaware.
•
IT Systems - Further upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system and hardware and software purchases for our other IT systems.
•
Other - Purchase of transportation equipment, tools, furniture, laboratory equipment, security systems and other general infrastructure needs including improvements to our operations center in Iselin, New Jersey.
The actual amount and timing of capital expenditures is dependent on the need for replacement of existing infrastructure, customer growth, residential new home construction and sales, project scheduling and continued refinement of project scope and costs and could be impacted if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue for an extended period of time.
To pay for our capital program in 2021, we plan on utilizing some or all of the following:
•
Internally generated funds;
•
Short-term borrowings, as needed, through $110 million of available lines of credit with several financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, there was $2.0 million borrowed under these lines (see discussion under “Sources of Liquidity-Short-term Debt” below);
•
Proceeds from the Delaware State Revolving Fund (SRF). SRF programs provide low cost financing for projects that meet certain water quality and system improvement benchmarks (see discussion under “Sources of Liquidity-Long-term Debt” below);
•
Remaining proceeds from the issuance and sale of FMBs through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) in August 2019 (see discussion under “Sources of Liquidity-Long-term Debt” below);
•
Proceeds from the sale and issuance of FMBs in private placement offerings and/or through the NJEDA;
•
Proceeds from the Investment Plan (see discussion under “Sources of Liquidity-Common Stock” below); and
•
Proceeds from a common stock sale (see discussion under “Sources of Liquidity-Common Stock” below).
Index
Sources of Liquidity
Short-term Debt. In January 2021, the Company reduced its’ available lines of credit from $140 million to $110 million. The outstanding borrowings under the credit lines at December 31, 2020 were $2.0 million, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.04%.
The weighted average daily amounts of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s credit lines and the weighted average interest rates on those amounts were $28.3 million and $52.4 million at 1.55% and 3.33% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Long-term Debt. Subject to regulatory approval, the Company periodically issues long-term debt to fund its investments in utility plant. To the extent possible, the Company finances qualifying capital projects under SRF loan programs in New Jersey and Delaware. These government programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the broader financial markets. A portion of the borrowings under the New Jersey SRF is interest-free. Under the New Jersey SRF program, borrowers first enter into a construction loan agreement with the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB) at a below market interest rate. The interest rate on the Company’s current construction loan borrowings is zero percent (0%). When construction on the qualifying project is substantially complete, NJIB will coordinate the conversion of the construction loan into a long-term securitized loan with a portion of the principal balance having a stated interest rate of zero percent (0%) and a portion of the principal balance at a market interest rate at the time of closing using the credit rating of the State of New Jersey. The term of the long-term loans currently offered through the NJIB is up to thirty years.
The NJIB generally schedules its long-term debt financings in May and November. Middlesex currently has two projects that are in the construction loan phase of the New Jersey SRF program as follows:
1)
In April 2018, the NJBPU approved Middlesex’s request to participate in the NJIB loan program to fund the construction of a 4.5 mile large-diameter transmission pipeline from the Carl J. Olsen water treatment plant in Edison, New Jersey and interconnect with our distribution system. Middlesex closed on a $43.5 million NJIB interest-free construction loan in August 2018. Through December 31, 2020, Middlesex has drawn a total of $41.9 million and expects to draw any remaining funding requests on this construction loan in the first quarter of 2021.
2)
In March 2018, the NJBPU approved Middlesex’s request to participate in the NJIB loan program to fund the 2018 RENEW Program, which is an ongoing initiative to eliminate unlined water distribution mains in the Middlesex system. Middlesex closed on an $8.7 million NJIB construction loan in September 2018 and completed withdrawal of the proceeds in October 2019.
The Company expects that the large-diameter transmission pipeline and the 2018 RENEW construction loans will be included in the NJIB May 2021 long-term debt financing program.
In September 2018, the NJIB announced changes to the SRF program for project funding priority ranking, the proportions of interest free loans and market interest rate loans and overall loan limits on interest free loan balances to investor-owned water utilities. These changes affect SRF projects for which the construction loan closes after September 2018. Under the new guidelines, the principal balance having a stated interest rate of zero percent (0%) is 25% of the loan balance with the remaining portion of 75% having a market based interest rate. This is limited to the first $10.0 million of the loan. Loan amounts above $10.0 million do not participate in the 0% rate program, but do participate at the market based interest rate. As a result of all these changes, the Company’s future capital funding plan currently does not include participating in the NJIB SRF program.
In May 2020, Middlesex received approval from the NJBPU to borrow up to $100 million, in one or more private placement transactions through December 31, 2023 to help fund Middlesex’s multi-year capital construction program. In November 2020, Middlesex closed on a $40.0 million private placement loan with a payment maturity date of November 2050 and an interest rate of 2.90% by issuing a FMB designated as Series 2020A.
Index
Proceeds from this loan were used to reduce the Company’s existing short-term borrowings under its lines of credit and for the Company’s 2020 capital program.
In order to help ensure adherence to its comprehensive financing plan, Middlesex received approval from the NJBPU in February 2019 to issue and sell up to $140 million of FMBs through the NJEDA in one or more transactions through December 31, 2022. Because the interest paid to the bondholders is exempt from federal and New Jersey income taxes, the interest rate on debt issued through the NJEDA is generally lower than otherwise achievable in the traditional taxable corporate bond market. However, the interest received by the bondholder is subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.
In August 2019, Middlesex priced and closed on a NJEDA debt financing transaction of $53.7 million by issuing FMBs designated as Series 2019A ($32.5 million at coupon interest rate of 4.0%) and Series 2019B ($21.2 million at coupon interest rate of 5.0%). The proceeds, including an issuance premium of $7.1 million, are being used to finance several projects under the Water For Tomorrow capital program initiated by the Company to upgrade and replace aging water utility infrastructure. The total proceeds of $60.8 million, initially recorded as Restricted Cash on the balance sheet, are held in escrow by a bond trustee and are drawn down by requisition for the qualifying projects. Through December 31, 2020, Middlesex has drawn a total of $55.1 million and currently expects to draw the remaining $5.7 million of proceeds, currently included in Restricted Cash, through the second quarter of 2021.
In March 2018, the DEPSC approved Tidewater’s request to borrow up to $0.9 million under the Delaware SRF program to fund the replacement of an entire water distribution system of a small Delaware community. Tidewater closed on the SRF loan in May 2018. In April 2019, Tidewater received approval from the DEPSC to increase the borrowing to $1.7 million based on revised project cost estimates. Tidewater closed on the additional SRF loan in October 2019 and completed withdrawal of the proceeds in April 2020.
Substantially all of the utility plant of the Company is subject to the lien of its mortgage, which includes debt service and capital ratio covenants. The Company is in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions.
Common Stock. In November 2019, the Company sold and issued 0.8 million shares of common stock in a public offering priced at $60.50 per share. The net proceeds of $43.7 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of a portion of the Company’s short-term debt outstanding.
The Company raised approximately $1.2 million through the issuance of shares under the Investment Plan during 2020. In 2019, the Company raised approximately $12.7 million primarily through a limited duration six-month share purchase discount feature of the Investment Plan. The 0.2 million share purchase limit was reached and the discount offer ceased prior to the original ending date.
In order to fully fund the ongoing large investment program in our utility plant infrastructure and maintain a balanced capital structure for a regulated water utility, Middlesex may offer for sale additional shares of its common stock. The amount, the timing and the sales method of the common stock is dependent on the timing of the construction expenditures, the level of additional debt financing and financial market conditions. As approved by the NJBPU, the Company is authorized to issue and sell up to 0.7 million shares of its common stock in one or more transactions through December 31, 2022.
Contractual Obligations
In the course of normal business activities, the Company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments. Some result in direct obligations on the Company’s balance sheet while others are commitments, some firm and some based on uncertainties, which are disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Index
The table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of December 31, 2020.
The table above does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for retirement benefit plan obligations. The effect on the timing and amount of these payments resulting from potential changes in actuarial assumptions and returns on plan assets cannot be estimated. In 2020, the Company contributed $4.5 million to its retirement benefit plans and expects to contribute approximately $4.2 million in 2021.
We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements, or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to the calculation of pension and other retirement benefits, unbilled revenues, and the recoverability of certain assets, including regulatory assets. The Company bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and current operating environment. Changes in any of the variables that are used for the Company’s estimates, assumptions and judgments may lead to significantly different financial statement results.
Our critical accounting policies are set forth below.
Regulatory Accounting
We maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries, which account for approximately 91% of Operating Revenues and 99% of Total Assets, are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate. Those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities’ rules and guidelines, which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements. In those instances, the Company follows the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980 Regulated Operations (Regulatory Accounting).
In accordance with Regulatory Accounting, costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate-making purposes in future rates. Accordingly, we have recorded costs and obligations, which will be amortized over various future periods. Any change in the assessment of the probability of rate-making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item. We have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future.

Revenues
The Company’s revenues are primarily generated from regulated tariff-based sales of water and wastewater services and non-regulated operation and maintenance contracts for services on water and wastewater systems owned by others. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of a promised good or service is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
The Company’s regulated revenue from contracts with customers is derived from tariff-based sales that result from the obligation to provide water and wastewater services to residential, industrial, commercial, fire-protection and wholesale customers. The Company’s residential customers are billed quarterly while most of the Company’s industrial, commercial, fire-protection and wholesale customers are billed monthly. Payments by customers are due between 15 to 30 days after the invoice date. The Company recognizes revenue as the water and wastewater services are delivered to customers as well as records unbilled revenues estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period utilizing factors such as historical customer data, regional weather indicators and general economic conditions in its service territories. Unearned Revenues and Advance Service Fees include fixed service charge billings in advance to Tidewater customers that are recognized as service is provided to the customer.
Non-regulated service contract revenues consist of base service fees as well as fees for additional billable services provided to customers. Fees are billed monthly and are due within 30 days after the invoice date. The Company considers the amounts billed to represent the value of these services provided to customers. These contracts expire at various times through June 2030 and thus contain remaining performance obligations for which the Company expects to recognize revenue in the future. These contracts also contain customary termination provisions.
Almost all of the amounts included in operating revenues are from contracts with customers.
Retirement Benefit Plans
We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) which covers all currently active employees who were hired prior to April 1, 2007. In addition, the Company maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers.
The Company has a retirement benefit plan other than pensions (Other Benefits Plan) for substantially all of its retired employees. Employees hired after March 31, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the Other Benefits Plan. Coverage includes healthcare and life insurance.
The costs for providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Future retirement benefit plan obligations and expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other demographic factors related to the population participating in the Company’s retirement benefit plans, all of which can change significantly in future years.
The allocation by asset category of retirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
Index
The primary assumptions used for determining future retirement benefit plans’ obligations and costs are as follows:
•
Discount Rate - calculated based on market rates for long-term, high-quality corporate bonds specific to the expected duration of our Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plan’s liabilities;
•
Compensation Increase - based on management projected future employee compensation increases;
•
Long-Term Rate of Return - determined based on expected returns from our asset allocation for our Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plan assets;
•
Mortality - The Company utilizes the Society of Actuaries’ mortality table (Pri-2012) (Mortality Improvement Scale MP2020 for the 2020 valuation); and
•
Healthcare Cost Trend Rate - based on management projected future healthcare costs.
The discount rate, compensation increase rate and long-term rate of return used to determine future obligations of our retirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:
For the 2020 valuation, costs and obligations for our Other Benefits Plan assumed an 7.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits in 2021 with the annual rate of increase declining 0.5% per year for 2022-2027, resulting in an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of 4.5% by year 2027.
The following is a sensitivity analysis for certain actuarial assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations (PBO) and expenses for our retirement benefit plans:
