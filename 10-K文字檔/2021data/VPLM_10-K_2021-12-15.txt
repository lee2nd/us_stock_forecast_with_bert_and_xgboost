CORPORATE HISTORY, OVERVIEW AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS
VoIP-PAL.com Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. and changed its name to VOIP MDI.com in 2004 and subsequently to Voip-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in the development stage of becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. All business activities prior to March 2004 have been abandoned and written off to deficit.
In 2013, the Company acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited (“Digifonica”), to fund and co-develop Digifonica’s patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications - a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).
The Digifonica patents formed the basis for the Company’s current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of twenty-six issued and pending patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market.
The Company’s intellectual property value is derived from its issued and pending patents. The inventions described in these patents, among other things, provide the means to integrate VoIP services with legacy telecommunications systems such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to create a seamless service using either legacy telephone numbers or IP addresses, and enhance the performance and value of VoIP implementations worldwide.
VoIP has been and continues to be a green field for innovation that has spawned numerous inventions, greatly benefitting consumers large and small across the globe. VoIP is used in many places and by every modern telephony system vendor, network supplier, and retail and wholesale carrier.
Results of Operations
The Company’s operating costs consist of expenses incurred to monetizing, selling and licensing its VoIP patents. Other operating costs include expenses for legal, accounting and other professional fees, financing costs, and other general and administrative expenses.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
Performance Bonus Payable
In 2016, the board of directors authorized the Company to provide a performance bonus (the “Performance Bonus”) of up to 3% of the capital stock of the Company by way of the issuance of Common shares from its treasury to an as yet undetermined group of related and non-related parties upon the occurrence of a bonusable event, defined as the successful completion of a sale of the Company or substantially all its assets, or a major licensing transaction. In order to provide maximum flexibility to the Company with respect to determining the level of Performance Bonus payable, and who may qualify to receive a pro-rata share of such a Performance Bonus, the Company authorized full discretion to the Board in making such determinations.
In 2019, the board of directors authorized the increase of the Performance Bonus to up to 10% of the capital stock of the Company. Concurrently, the directors authorized 66.67% of the Performance Bonus to be issued in an advance payment of an aggregate 127,000,000 Common shares (“Bonus Shares”) to a group of related and non-related parties, which included members of management, a director and several consultants. 60,000,000 of the Bonus Shares are restricted from trading under Rule 144 and subject to voluntary lock-up agreements under which they cannot be traded, pledged, hypothecated, transferred or sold by the holders until such time as the Company has met the requirements of the bonusable event as described above.
As at September 30, 2021, no bonusable event had occurred and there was no Performance Bonus payable.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ending September 30, 2021. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Its impact on global economies has been far-reaching and businesses around the world are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have also experienced great volatility and significant declines. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions.
The duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear at this time. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, nor its impact on the financial position and results of the Company in future periods. The Company is proceeding with its business activities as long as the work environment remains safe - at this point there has been minimal disruption to day-to-day operations resulting from health and safety measures. Disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets may increase the Company’s cost of capital and adversely impact access to capital.
