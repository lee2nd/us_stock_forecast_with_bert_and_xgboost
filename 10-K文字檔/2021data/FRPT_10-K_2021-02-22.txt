ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in “Risk Factors.” The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. For more information regarding our consolidated results and liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to "Part II-Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
Overview
We started Freshpet with a single-minded mission to bring the power of real, fresh food to our dogs and cats. We were inspired by the rapidly growing view among pet owners that their dogs and cats are a part of their family, leading them to demand healthier pet food choices. Since inception of the company in 2006, we have created a comprehensive business model to deliver wholesome pet food that pet parents can trust, and in the process, we believe we have become one of the fastest growing pet food companies in North America. Our business model is difficult for others to replicate and we see significant opportunity for future growth by leveraging the unique elements of our business, including our brand, our product know-how, our Freshpet Kitchens, our refrigerated distribution, our Freshpet Fridge and our culture.
Recent Developments
Observations on the Effects of COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") was reported, and by March 2020, the World Health Organization ("WHO") had characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Due to COVID-19, our retail customers experienced a surge in consumption as consumers stocked up on food and necessities towards the second half of Q1 2020. The unexpected surge in consumption caused a spike in orders which at times were greater than our production capacity.
At the end of Q1, we announced our post-surge pivot. That strategic pivot was built on a foundation that said, if we could keep our employees safe, then we could rebuild our supply and that would enable us to replenish our product supply in retail stores, which would allow us to turn to our advertising to drive consumption and household penetrations gains. As a result, we invested in each of those areas, including safety enhancement to protect our team, incremental capacity at Freshpet Kitchens South, incremental retail coverage, new e-commerce purchase and delivery options and additional media advertising.
The Company made and continues to make investments designed to protect its team members. These efforts include taking the temperature of every team member and administering a brief health screening before entering our Freshpet Kitchens, installing increased space for social distancing, instituting staggered shifts, enhancing daily sanitation efforts and weekly deep cleaning of all common areas, requiring use of face coverings by all employees, and limiting visitors, who must also submit to a health check before entering the facilities.
Despite the COVID-19 related disruptions, our ability to bring the power of fresh to pet parents has continued, in part due to our post-surge pivot. Consumers' increased interest in their pets, the strong appeal of the Freshpet idea and products, our ability to continuously run our manufacturing facilities and successfully add capacity, the increased impact of our advertising, and our customers' realization of the value that Freshpet brings to their pet food category offerings and stores has resulted in some of our strongest growth. As noted above, the unexpected surge in consumption towards the second half of Q1 2020, as well as the subsequent strong growth, has caused us to draw down on trade inventory and have higher out of stocks than usual. With the additional capacity brought on during Q2 through Q4, as well as Freshpet Kitchens 2.0 beginning production in October 2020, we believe we will be able to rebuild our trade inventory and decrease our out of stocks during the first half of 2021.
We are unsure how long the COVID-19 pandemic will require us to absorb higher costs to protect and reward our employees while simultaneously ensuring we can support our pet parents with a continual supply of Freshpet products. We are also monitoring our supply of raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials. Although we have not experienced any extended supply interruptions to date and our chicken prices for the year are fixed contractually, subject to limited exceptions, we have used our secondary suppliers from time-to-time, and have also experienced higher beef prices as a result of reduced supplies. As of December 31, 2020, COVID-19 related expenses were $3.9 million.
We will continue to monitor the retail environment and pet parent demand, and intend to adapt to changing conditions to continue to drive growth and meet our goal of "changing the way people feed their pets forever" during the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.
Supporting Freshpet's Growth
At the Company's February 2020 Investor Day, Freshpet presented its "Feed the Growth - 5 by 2025" strategic plan. The plan looked to add 5 million more households by 2025, for a total 8 million households. During 2020, the Company continued to see increased sales growth and household penetration despite capacity limits and less than planned advertising spend. As a result, the Company is raising its 2025 household penetration target from 8 million to 11 million households. To support the strategic plan Freshpet is committed to invest in production capacity as well as upgrades to our systems and processes. The Company is continuously evaluating its ability to feed as many pets as possible and minimize its impact on the environment, and will continue to make investments that provides the necessary returns on its investments to deliver on Pets, People, Planet.
Manufacturing Site Manufacturing Capability Investments to be Made
Freshpet Kitchens Bethlehem Kitchens 1.0
Kitchens 1.0 is approximately a 100,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Bethlehem, PA. It has 4 manufacturing lines, each of which has the ability to produce our Freshpet Recipes 7 days a week/24 hours a day.
Kitchens 2.0
Kitchens 2.0 is a 140,000 square-foot addition to our Bethlehem, PA campus. It will have two manufacturing lines. Freshpet Kitchens 2.0 will make greater use of automation to improve quality, safety and reduce costs. In addition Kitchens 2.0 delivers on our commitment to continue to minimize our manufacturing impact. Production of saleable product began in October 2020. Freshpet Kitchens 2.0 is expected to produce at full capacity by the middle of 2021.
Kitchens 2.0 will cost $115.0 million when fully completed. To date, we have invested approximately $104.5 million, with the remaining spend to be incurred in the first half of 2021.
Freshpet Kitchens South During 2020, the Company officially opened a manufacturing facility called "Freshpet Kitchens South," which cooked its first meal in February 2020.
In order to ensure we are able to deliver on projected growth, the Company is also looking to add additional manufacturing lines. The capacity build out is expected to occur in two phases.
By the end of 2021, we expect the first phase of Freshpet Kitchens South to be completed. By the start of 2023, we expect the second phase to be completed which includes a second building that will house additional manufacturing lines.
During 2020, the Company invested approximately $15.8 million. From 2021 to 2023, we expect to make an additional investment of $180 million to complete phase 1 and phase 2.
Freshpet Kitchens Ennis During the end of 2019, the Company started its initial design and engineering phase of Kitchens Ennis, which sits on 74 acres in Ennis, Texas. We expect initial production to begin by the first half of 2022.
Projected spend on the project is $530 to $600 million. We have invested approximately $31.0 million in the project to date.
Additionally, the Company is upgrading its enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system. The project commenced in Q1 2020 and is expected to run through Q4 of 2021.
On February 19, 2021, the Company entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, by and among the Company, as borrower, City National Bank, as the arranger and administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the "New Loan Agreement"), which amends and restates in full the Company's Fifth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. The New Loan Agreement provides for a $350 million senior secured credit facility, encompassing a $300 million delayed draw term loan facility and a $50 million revolving loan facility, which replaces the Company's prior $130 million delayed draw term loan facility and $35 million revolving loan facility.
To meet our capital needs, we expect to rely on our current and future cash flow from operations, our available borrowing capacity, and access to the debt and equity markets, where appropriate.
Components of our Results of Operations
Net Sales
Our net sales are derived from the sale of pet food to our customers, who purchase either directly from us or through third-party distributors. Our products are sold to consumers through a fast-growing network of company-owned branded refrigerators, known as Freshpet Fridges, located in our customers’ stores. We continue to roll out Freshpet Fridges across leading retailers across North America and parts of Europe and have installed Freshpet Fridges in approximately 22,700 retail stores as of December 31, 2020. Our products are sold under the Freshpet brand name, with ingredients, packaging and labeling customized by class of retail. Sales are recorded net of discounts, slotting, returns and promotional allowances.
Our net sales growth is driven by the following key factors:
●
Increasing sales velocity from the average Freshpet Fridge due to increasing awareness, trial and adoption of Freshpet products and innovation. Our investments in marketing and advertising help to drive awareness and trial at each point of sale.
●
Increasing penetration of Freshpet Fridge locations in major classes of retail, including grocery (including online), mass, club, pet specialty and natural. The impact of new Freshpet Fridge installations on our net sales varies by retail class and depends on numerous factors including store traffic, refrigerator size, placement within the store and proximity to other stores that carry our products.
●
Consumer trends including growing pet ownership, pet humanization and a focus on health and wellness.
We believe that as a result of the above key factors, we will continue to penetrate the pet food marketplace and increase our share of the pet food category.
Gross Profit
Our gross profit is net of costs of goods sold, which include the costs of product manufacturing, product ingredients, packaging materials, inbound freight and depreciation.
Our gross profit margins are also impacted by the cost of ingredients, packaging materials, labor and overhead, and share-based compensation related to direct labor and overhead. We expect to mitigate any adverse movement in input costs through a combination of cost management and price increases.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Due to our Feed the Growth initiative, which has increased our investment level in media to drive growth, our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of net sales has decreased. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 49.1% in 2018, 46.6% in 2019 and 42.3% in 2020. We believe that as we continue to realize the benefits of our Feed the Growth initiative, SG&A expenses will continue to decrease as a percentage of net sales.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of the following:
Outbound freight. We utilize a third-party logistics provider for outbound freight that ships directly to retailers as well as third-party distributors.
Marketing & advertising. Our marketing and advertising expenses primarily consist of national television media, digital marketing, social media and grass roots marketing to drive brand awareness. These expenses may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our marketing and advertising campaigns. Our Feed the Growth initiative will focus on growing the business through increased marketing investments.
Freshpet Fridge operating costs. Freshpet Fridge operating costs consist of repair costs and depreciation. The purchase and installation costs for new Freshpet Fridges are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life. All new refrigerators are covered by a manufacturer warranty for three years. We subsequently incur maintenance and freight costs for repairs and refurbishments handled by third-party service providers.
Research & development (“R&D”). R&D costs consist of expenses to develop and test new products. The costs are expensed as incurred.
Brokerage. We utilize third-party brokers to assist with monitoring our products at the point-of-sale as well as representing us at headquarters for various customers. These brokers visit our retail customers’ store locations and ensure items are appropriately stocked and maintained.
Share-based compensation. We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, directors and non-employees using a fair value method. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line basis.
Other general & administrative costs. Other general and administrative costs include plant salaried and non-plant personnel salaries and benefits, as well as corporate general & administrative costs.
Income Taxes
We had federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carry forwards of approximately $239.8 million as of December 31, 2020, of which, approximately $175.0 million, generated in 2017 and prior, will expire between 2025 and 2037. The NOL generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020, of approximately $64.4 million, will have an indefinite carryforward period but can generally only be used to offset 80% of taxable income in any particular year. We may be subject to certain limitations in our annual utilization of NOL carry forwards to off-set future taxable income pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could result in NOLs expiring unused. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $189.8 million of state NOLs, which expire between 2020 and 2038. At December 31, 2020, we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as the realization of such assets was not considered more likely than not.
Results of Operations
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 Compared To Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019
Net Sales
The following table sets forth net sales by class of retail:
(1)
Stores at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 consisted of 12,560 and 11,315 grocery (including online) and 5,210 and 4,963 mass and club, respectively.
(2)
Stores at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 consisted of 4,470 and 4,837 pet specialty and 476 and 455 natural, respectively.
Net sales increased $72.9 million, or 29.7%, to $318.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The $72.9 million increase in net sales was driven by growth in the Grocery (including Online), Mass, and Club refrigerated channel of $65.4 million, and Pet Specialty and Natural of $7.5 million. The net sales increase was driven by overall velocity gains and an increase of Freshpet Fridges store locations, which grew by 5.3% from 21,570 as of December 31, 2019 to 22,716 as of December 31, 2020.
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $18.7 million, or 16.4%, to $132.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by higher net sales offset by decreased gross margin.
Our gross profit margin of 41.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was a decrease of 470 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year, due to plant start-up cost of 190 basis points, COVID-19 related cost of 110 basis points, increased processing cost of 100 basis points, increased depreciation and stock compensation cost of 70 basis points, increased beef input cost of 70 basis points, partially offset by increase in sales price and shifting selling mix of 70 basis points.
Adjusted Gross Profit was $154.1 million and $121.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin as a percentage of net sales was 48.3% and 49.4% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Adjusted Gross Profit excludes $9.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.0 million of plant start-up expense, $2.1 million of non-cash share-based compensation and $3.5 million of COVID-19 expense in 2020 and excludes $6.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $0.9 million of non-cash share-based compensation in 2019. See “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for how we define Adjusted Gross Profit and a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit to Gross Profit, the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses increased $20.5 million, or 17.9%, to $134.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Key components of the dollar increase include higher media spend of $3.2 million, increased variable cost due to volume of $7.9 million, which includes freight cost and brokerage, higher depreciation and share-based compensation expense of $3.4 million, increased loss on disposal of assets of $1.0 million, cost associated with implementation of new ERP of $1.7 million, COVID-19 cost of $0.4 million, increased selling expense of $1.1 million and higher incremental operating expenses of $2.3 million, offset by lower launch expense of $1.1 million. The increased operating expenses were primarily due to new hires and increased employee benefit costs. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 42.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from 46.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Adjusted SG&A Expenses was $107.2 million and $92.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Adjusted SG&A Expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to 33.7% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 37.6% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of 400 basis points in Adjusted SG&A Expenses is a result of 220 basis point gain in SG&A leverage and 180 basis point increase related to media ad spend decrease as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted SG&A Expenses excludes $11.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $8.8 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $3.4 million of launch expense, $1.8 million of loss on disposal of equipment, $0.1 million of equity offering expenses, $1.7 million in enterprise resource planning expense, and $0.4 million in COVID-19 expenses in 2020, while excluding $9.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.9 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $4.6 million of launch expense, $0.6 million of loss on disposal of equipment, and $0.3 million of equity offering expenses in 2019. Adjusted SG&A is a Non-GAAP measure. See “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for how we define Adjusted SG&A, a reconciliation of Adjusted SG&A to SG&A, the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure, certain limitations of Non-GAAP measures and why management has included such Non-GAAP measures.
Loss from Operations
Loss from operations increased $1.7 million from a loss of $0.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to a loss of $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the factors discussed above.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $1.2 million and $1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, relating primarily to our credit facilities. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Other Income/(Expenses), net
Other income/(expenses), net increased $0.1 million from an income of less than $0.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to income of $0.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Net Loss
Net loss increased $1.8 million, or 130.6%, to net loss of $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net loss of $1.4 million for the same period in the prior year. Net loss was 1.0% of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a net loss of 0.6% of net sales for the same period in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.7 million from $29.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to $46.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales increased 280 basis points from 11.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 14.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of leverage gain on Adjusted SG&A excluding media of 220 basis points and decreased media spend as part of our Feed the Growth initiative of 170 basis points, partially offset by a decrease in Adjusted Gross Margin of 110 basis points.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Freshpet uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in its financial communications. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.

Such financial measures are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as Gross Profit before non-cash depreciation expense, plant start-up expenses, non-cash share-based compensation and COVID-19 expenses. We define Adjusted SG&A as SG&A expenses before depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash share-based compensation, launch expense, net gain/loss on disposal of equipment, equity offering expenses, implementation and other costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system, litigation expenses, and COVID-19 expenses. EBITDA represents net income (loss) plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus net gain/loss on disposal of equipment, non-cash share-based compensation, launch expenses, plant start-up expenses, equity offering expenses, implementation and other costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system, litigation expenses and COVID-19 expenses. We have changed our method for calculating Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted EBITDA in light of certain non-recurring expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic and in light of the implementation of a new ERP system.
We believe that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional metrics to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We use the non-GAAP financial measures, together with U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, gross profit margins and cash flow from operations, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors.
Adjusted EBITDA is also an important component of internal budgeting and setting management compensation.
The non-GAAP financial measures are presented here because we believe they are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items, and other items as detailed below. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner as we do.
Our presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from that term or by unusual or non-recurring items. We recognize that the non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect:
●
our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures;
●
the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments, associated with indebtedness;
●
depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, nor any cash requirements for such replacements; and
●
changes in cash requirements for our working capital needs.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, and (ii) certain costs essential to our sales growth and strategy, including an allowance for marketing expenses for each new store added to our network and non-capitalizable freight costs associated with Freshpet Fridge replacements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Other companies in our industry may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP:
(a)
Represents new store marketing allowance of $1,000 for each store added to our distribution network, as well as the non-capitalized freight costs associated with Freshpet Fridge replacements. The expense enhances the overall marketing spend to support our growing distribution network.
(b)
Represents additional operating costs incurred in connection with the start-up of our new manufacturing lines as part of the Freshpet Kitchens expansion projects.
(c)
Represents fees associated with public offerings of our common stock.
(d) Represents implementation and other costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system.
(e)
Represents fees associated with the response to two securities lawsuits.
(f) Represents COVID-19 expenses including (i) costs incurred to protect the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) temporary increased compensation expense to ensure continued operations during the pandemic, and (iii) costs to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Developing our business will require significant capital in the future. We expect to make future capital expenditures of approximately $700.0 million in connection with the development of Freshpet Kitchens Bethlehem, Freshpet Kitchens Ennis, and Freshpet Kitchens South. To meet our capital needs, we expect to rely on our current and future cash flow from operations, our current available borrowing capacity, and access to the debt and equity markets, if appropriate. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors, including general market conditions, our operating performance, the market’s perception of our growth potential, lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions, such as financial covenants under our debt agreements.
Additionally, our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, any indebtedness under our credit facilities and to fund any necessary expenditures for our growth will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business. Future third-party financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
Our primary cash needs, in addition to our plant expansions, are for ingredients, purchases and operating expenses, marketing expenses and capital expenditures to procure Freshpet Fridges. We believe that cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flow from operations, planned borrowing capacity and our ability to access the capital markets, if appropriate, are adequate to fund our debt service requirements, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as selling additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our working capital:
Working Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital increased $63.7 million to $76.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared with $12.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of cash and cash equivalents, inventory, prepaid expenses, and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and other current assets.
We normally carry three to four weeks of finished goods inventory. The average duration of our accounts receivable is approximately 25 days.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 our capital resources consisted of primarily $67.2 million cash on hand and $163.0 million available under our credit facilities, net of $2.0 million reserved for two letters of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our capital resources consisted primarily of $9.5 million cash on hand and $33.0 million available under our credit facilities. The credit facilities will mature in April 2025.
We borrowed $20.9 million under our credit facilities during the first quarter of 2020, bringing the Company's total outstanding debt to $76.0 million. The total outstanding debt of $76.0 million was repaid during the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no debt outstanding under our credit facilities. There was $54.5 million of debt outstanding (including $0.7 million of debt issuance costs) under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2019.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash, net cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (provision for gain/loss on receivables, loss on disposal of assets, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred financing costs and loan discounts and inventory obsolescence).
Net cash provided by operating activities of $21.2 million in 2020 was primarily attributable to:

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table sets forth our expected contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
Critical Accounting Policies
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing in this report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.
We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies related to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results, as determined at a later date, could differ from those estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimate and the actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
The following critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition and Incentives - Revenue is reported net of applicable trade incentives and allowances. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-term basis. The Company applies judgment in the determination of the amount of consideration the Company receives from its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in trade incentives the Company offers to its customers and their consumers. Trade incentives consist primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds, and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered, timing of those offers, estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance, management’s experience and current economic trends.
Share-based Compensation-We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, directors and nonemployees using a fair value method. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method.
We have outstanding share-based awards that have performance-based vesting conditions in addition to time-based vesting. Awards with performance-based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial criteria as a condition to the vesting. For certain performance-based awards, the quantity of awards received can range based on the level of performance achieved. The performance-based awards with financial criteria either have a Net Sales or Adjusted EBITDA target within FY 2021 through FY 2024. We recognize the estimated fair value of performance-based awards as share-based compensation expense over the performance period based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved. At each reporting period, we reassess the probability of achieving the performance criteria and the performance period required to meet those targets. Determining whether the performance criteria will be achieved involves judgment, and the share-based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the probability assessment is changed. If performance goals are not met, no share-based compensation expense is recognized for the cancelled shares, and, to the extent share-based compensation expense was previously recognized for those cancelled shares, such share-based compensation expense is reversed.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 (Recently Issued Accounting Standards) to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Segment
We have determined we operate in one segment: the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of pet food and pet treats for dogs and cats.
Inflation
Our profitability is dependent, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and other raw materials, labor, energy and other supplies and services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our customers. The impact of inflation on food, labor and energy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our Company.
While we have been able to offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources through price increases, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions could make additional price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that all future cost increases can be offset by increased prices or that increased prices will be fully absorbed without any resulting changes in their purchasing patterns.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off balance sheet arrangements or holdings in variable interest entities.
