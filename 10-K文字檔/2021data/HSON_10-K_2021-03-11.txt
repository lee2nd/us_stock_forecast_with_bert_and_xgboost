The Company’s focus is to continually upgrade its service offerings and delivery capability tools to make candidates more successful in achieving its clients’ business requirements.
The Company’s proprietary frameworks, assessment tools, and leadership development programs, coupled with its broad geographic footprint, allow the Company to design and implement regional and global outsourced recruitment solutions that the Company believes greatly enhance the quality and efficiency of its clients’ hiring.
To accelerate the implementation of the Company’s strategy, the Company engaged in the following initiatives:
•Facilitating growth and development of the global RPO business through strategic investments in people, innovation, and technology.
•Building and differentiating the Company’s brand through its unique outsourcing solutions offerings.
•Improving the Company’s cost structure and efficiency of its support functions and infrastructure.
We continue to explore all strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, including without limitation, improving the market position and profitability of our services in the marketplace, and enhancing our valuation. We may pursue our goals through organic growth, strategic initiatives, or other alternatives. We will also continue to monitor capital markets for opportunities to repurchase shares, and consider other actions designed to enhance shareholder value, as well as review information regarding potential acquisitions and provide information to third parties, from time to time.
This MD&A discusses the results of the Company’s RPO businesses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Current Market Conditions
After a challenging year in 2020, economic conditions in most of the world’s major markets are expected to rebound in 2021, although activity is expected to remain below pre-COVID levels. The approval and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in some countries provides a potential path for an eventual end to the pandemic, however expectations for recovery are hampered by rising infections and new variants of the virus. Policy measures enacted by country governments to combat the economic impact of the virus are expected to provide additional support to local economies. In addition the continued uncertainty has resulted in increased volatility in global currencies. Effective containment measures in China have resulted in a stronger recovery, and agreement on the terms of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union have eliminated some of the uncertainty in that country. Stronger foreign currencies in these and other markets compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period cause local currency results of the Company’s foreign operations to be translated into more U.S. dollars. The Company closely monitors the economic environment and business climate in its markets and responds accordingly.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The continuing impact of COVID-19 around the world presents significant risks to the Company, which the Company is unable to fully evaluate or even to foresee at the current time. In 2020, some of our customers instituted hiring freezes, while other customers operating in the banking, pharmaceutical and technology industries, which may be considered as essential businesses in different jurisdictions, or customers that were more capable of working remotely than other industries, have been allowed to operate as usual. The inability to conduct in-person interviews also impacted our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted certain currencies compared to the U.S. dollar in several countries where we operate, including Australia.
The COVID-19 pandemic affected the Company’s operations in the 2020 and may continue to do so in the future. All of these factors may have far reaching impacts on the Company’s business, operations, and financial results and conditions, directly and indirectly, including without limitation impacts on the health of the Company’s management and employees, marketing and sales operations, customer and consumer behaviors, and on the overall economy. The scope and nature of these impacts, most of which are beyond the Company’s control, continue to evolve and the outcomes are uncertain.
Due to the above circumstances and as described generally in this Form 10-K, the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future years. Management cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s sales or on economic conditions generally. The ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time even after the pandemic might end.
Financial Performance
Constant Currency (Non-GAAP measure)
The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of its revenue generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. For the discussion of reportable segment results of operations, the Company uses constant currency information. Constant currency compares financial results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company defines the term “constant currency” to mean that financial data for previously reported periods are translated into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate financial data for the current period. Constant currency metrics should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The Company’s management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currency and believes these results better represent the Company’s underlying business trends.
The following is a summary of the highlights for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. These should be considered in the context of the additional disclosures in this MD&A.
•Revenue was $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $93.8 million for 2019, an increase of $7.6 million, or 8%. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in Australia offset by declines in the UK, Americas, and Asia.
◦On a constant currency basis, revenue increased $7.2 million, or 8%. Contracting revenue increased $12.4 million (up 25% compared to 2019) and RPO recruitment revenue decreased $5.2 million (down 12% compared to 2019). Revenue included $1.1 million from the acquisition of Coit Staffing, Inc. (see Note 4 to
- 13 -
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), which contributed 1 percentage point to the revenue growth.
•Selling, general and administrative expenses, and other non-operating income (expense) (“SG&A and Non-Op”) was $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $45.5 million for 2019, for a decrease of $5.7 million, or 13%.
◦On a constant currency basis, SG&A and Non-Op decreased $5.8 million or 13%. SG&A and Non-Op, as a percentage of revenue, was 39% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 48% for 2019. The decrease was principally due to lower staff costs of $2.1 million, Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) debt extinguishment (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information) of $1.3 million, lower travel and entertainment costs of $1 million, and COVID-19 foreign government assistance credits of $0.5 million.
•EBITDA loss was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to EBITDA loss of $1.9 million for 2019. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA loss decreased $1.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The acquisition of Coit Staffing, Inc. positively contributed EBITDA of $63.
•Net loss was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net loss of $1.0 million for 2019. On a constant currency basis, net loss decreased $0.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019.

Changes in revenue, adjusted net revenue, SG&A and Non-Op, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and EBITDA (loss) include the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The tables below include a reconciliation of constant currency results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and summarize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate adjustments on the Company’s operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(a)Represents Revenue less the Direct contracting costs and reimbursed expenses caption on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(b)SG&A and Non-Op is a measure that management uses to evaluate the segments’ expenses, which include the following captions on the Consolidated Statements of Operations: Salaries and related, Office and general, Marketing and promotion, PPP loan forgiveness, and Other income (expense), net. Corporate management expenses are included in the segments’ other income (expense).
(c)See EBITDA reconciliation in the following section.

Use of EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure)
Management believes EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of the Company’s performance that provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA is also considered by management as an indicator of operating performance and the most comparable measure across the regions in which we operate. Management also uses this measurement to evaluate capital needs and working capital requirements. Similar to constant currency, EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or net income prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability. EBITDA is derived from net income (loss) adjusted for the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, interest expense (income), and depreciation and amortization.
The reconciliation of EBITDA loss to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the table below:

Results of Operations:
Americas (reported currency)
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, RPO recruitment revenue decreased $2.9 million, or 23%, partially offset by an increase in contracting revenue of $0.2 million, or 15%, as compared to 2019. The decrease in RPO recruitment revenue was attributable to slower demand for services from existing clients, due in part to the impact of COVID-19, while the increase in contracting revenue was due to growth of existing clients. The acquisition of Coit Staffing, Inc. (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8) positively contributed 8 percentage points to the revenue performance.
Adjusted net revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, RPO recruitment adjusted net revenue decreased $2.5 million, or 22%, and contracting adjusted net revenue decreased $0.2 million, or 29% as compared to 2019. The decrease in RPO recruitment adjusted net revenue was due to the same factors noted above for revenue. The acquisition of Coit Staffing, Inc. positively contributed 9 percentage points to the adjusted net revenue performance.
Total adjusted net revenue, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 88% for 2020, as compared to 91% for 2019, primarily attributable to the lower mix of RPO recruitment to contracting revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019.
SG&A and Non-Op
For the year ended December 31, 2020, SG&A and Non-Op decreased $1.6 million or 13%, as compared to 2019, primarily due to the PPP debt extinguishment of $1.3 million (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further details).
- 17 -
Operating Income and EBITDA
N/M = not meaningful
Operating loss was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an operating income $0.6 million for 2019. The increase in operating loss was principally due to the change in adjusted net revenue, as described above.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, EBITDA loss was $1.0 million, or 10% of revenue, as compared to EBITDA of $0.1 million in 2019. The increase in EBITDA loss was primarily due to the decrease in adjusted net revenue, partially offset by the decrease in SG&A and Non-op.
The difference between operating (loss) income and EBITDA (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to the PPP debt extinguishment of $1.3 million, and lower corporate management expenses compared to the prior year.
Asia Pacific (constant currency)
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, contracting revenue increased by $15.6 million, or 38%, partially offset by a decrease in RPO recruitment revenue of $1.7 million, or 8%, as compared to 2019.
In Australia, for the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue increased $14.5 million, or 27%, as compared to 2019. The increase was primarily in contracting revenue, which increased by $15.6 million, or 41%, partially offset by a decrease in RPO recruitment revenue of $1.1 million, or 7%, as compared to 2019. The increase in contracting revenue primarily reflected the implementation of a new contract win, while the decrease in RPO recruitment revenue was due to lower demand from existing clients.
In Asia, revenue decreased $0.8 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. The decrease in revenue was due to lower demand from existing clients.
Adjusted net revenue
- 18 -
For the year ended December 31, 2020, RPO recruitment adjusted net revenue decreased by $1.5 million, or 8%, partly offset by contracting adjusted net revenue, which increased by $0.1 million, or 8%, as compared to the same period in 2019.
In Australia, adjusted net revenue decreased by $0.8 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was driven by a decline in RPO recruitment adjusted net revenue of $1.0 million, or 7%, year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in contracting adjusted net revenue of $0.2 million, or 14.0%.
In Asia, adjusted net revenue decreased $0.6 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. The decrease in Asia was primarily driven by Hong Kong.
Adjusted net revenue as a percentage of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 26%, as compared to 34% for 2019. The decrease in total adjusted net revenue as a percentage of revenue was attributed to the higher mix of contracting, a lower margin service, to RPO recruitment revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019.
SG&A and Non-Op
For the year ended December 31, 2020, SG&A and Non-Op decreased $1.9 million, or 10%, as compared to 2019. The decrease was due to lower consultant staff costs and overhead costs, partly reflecting cost-cutting efforts due to the impact of COVID-19. SG&A and Non-Op, as a percentage of revenue, was 22% for 2020, as compared to 30% for 2019.
Operating Income and EBITDA
Operating income was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $3.2 million for 2019. The increase in operating income was principally due to the decrease in SG&A and Non-Op noted above, partly offset by the decline in adjusted net revenue.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, EBITDA was $2.9 million, or 4% of revenue, as compared to EBITDA of $2.3 million, or 4% of revenue, for 2019. The increase in EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was principally due to the factors noted above.
The difference between operating income and EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was principally due to corporate management expenses.

In the U.K., for the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue decreased $4.0 million, or 24%, to $12.9 million from $16.9 million in 2019. The decrease in the U.K. was primarily driven by an decline in contracting revenue of $3.4 million, or 41%, as compared to 2019.
In Continental Europe, for the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $2.0 million, as compared to $2.0 million for 2019, for a slight decrease of 1%. The decrease was due to lower demand at existing recruitment clients.
Adjusted net revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, adjusted net revenue decreased by $0.6 million, or 6%, driven by a decrease in RPO recruitment and contracting revenue of $0.4 million, or 4%, and $0.2 million, or 34%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2019.
In the U.K., total adjusted net revenue or the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased $0.6 million, or 7%, as compared to the same period in 2019. The change in the U.K. was driven by a decrease in RPO recruitment and contracting of $0.4 million or 5%, and $0.2 million or 34%, respectively.
In Continental Europe, for the year ended December 31, 2020, total adjusted net revenue decreased slightly, as compared to the same period in 2019.
SG&A and Non-Op
- 20 -
For the year ended December 31, 2020, SG&A and Non-Op decreased $1.1 million, or 11%, as compared to 2019. The decrease in SG&A and Non-Op was due to lower consultant staff costs and overhead costs, partly reflecting cost-cutting efforts due to the impact of COVID-19 as compared to the prior year. SG&A and Non-Op, as a percentage of revenue, was 61% for 2020 compared to 54% for 2019. The increase in SG&A and Non-Op, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to the decline in revenue noted above.
Operating Income and EBITDA
N/M = not meaningful
Operating income was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $0.6 million for 2019. The decrease in operating income was principally due to the decline in adjusted net revenue, partly offset by lower SG&A and Non-Op as described above.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, EBITDA was $0.5 million, or 3% of revenue, as compared to EBITDA of $0.1 million for 2019. The increase in EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was principally due to COVID-19 foreign government assistance credits of $0.3 million.
The difference between operating income (loss) and EBITDA (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was principally due to the government assistance credits, as well as lower foreign currency exchange and corporate management expenses compared to the prior year period.
The following are discussed in reported currency
Corporate expenses, net of corporate management expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, corporate expenses were $3.0 million as compared to $4.2 million for 2019, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 29%. The decrease was primarily due to lower staff costs, which in 2019 included severance expense of $0.5 million (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further details), compared to severance expense of $0.1 million in 2020. The decrease also reflected lower stock compensation expense and professional fees.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense was $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest Income, Net
Net interest income was $0.1 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
PPP loan forgiveness
PPP loan forgiveness of $1.3 million consisted of the forgiveness of a loan received earlier in the year administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, in exchange for maintaining certain levels of compensation and other costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic between April 25, 2020 and October 9, 2020.
- 21 -
Other income (expense), Net
Other income was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to other expense of $0.3 million for the same periods in 2019. The increase in income was primarily due to government assistance received in exchange for maintaining certain levels of compensation and other costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in the U.K., Hong Kong, and in Singapore, (See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further details).
Provision for (benefit from) Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.5 million, on $0.7 million of pre-tax loss from continuing operations, as compared to a benefit from income taxes of $0.5 million on $1.4 million of pre-tax loss from continuing operations for 2019. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was negative 75.5%, as compared to 39.1% for 2019. The change in the Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to reductions in uncertain tax positions in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate difference from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily attributable to the mix of income and losses in different jurisdictions taxed at different rates, as well as changes in valuations allowances in the U.S. and in our foreign subsidiaries.
Loss from Discontinued Operations
Loss from discontinued operations was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net Loss
Net loss was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net loss of $1.0 million for 2019, an increase in net loss of $0.3 million. Basic and diluted loss per share were $0.43 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.30 in 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $26.2 million, as compared to $31.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $1.4 million, as compared to $4.8 million of net cash used in operating activities for the same period in 2019, resulting in a decrease in net cash used in operating activities of $3.4 million. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities resulted principally from more favorable working capital comparisons to the prior year.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $4.0 million, as compared to $0.1 million of net cash used by investing activities in 2019. The increase in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the cash paid of $4.0 million on October 1, 2020 for the acquisition of Coit Staffing, Inc. See Note 4 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.
- 22 -
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $0.9 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $4.6 million for the same period in 2019, resulting in a decrease in net cash used by financing activities of $3.7 million. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was attributable to fewer shares repurchased, for an aggregate of $2.3 million in 2020 compared to $4.6 million in 2019, as well as proceeds from the PPP loan of $1.3 million in 2020.
Invoice Finance Credit Facility
On April 8, 2019, the Company’s Australian subsidiary (“Australian Borrower”) entered into an invoice finance credit facility agreement (the “NAB Facility Agreement”) with National Australia Bank Limited (“NAB”). The NAB Facility Agreement provides the Australian Borrower with the ability to borrow funds based on a percentage of eligible trade receivables up to a maximum of 4 million Australian dollars. No receivables have terms greater than 90 days, and any risk of loss is retained by the Australian Borrower. The interest rate is calculated as the variable receivable finance indicator rate, plus a margin of 1.60% per annum. Borrowings under this facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Australian Borrower. The NAB Facility Agreement does not have a stated maturity date and can be terminated by either the Australian Borrower or NAB upon 90 days written notice. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under the NAB Facility Agreement. Interest expense and fees incurred on the NAB Facility Agreement were $19 thousand and $20 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the NAB Facility Agreement as of December 31, 2020.
Liquidity Outlook
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $25.8 million. The Company also has the capability to borrow an additional 4 million Australian dollars under the NAB Facility Agreement. Other than as described above, the Company has no financial guarantees, outstanding debt or other lease agreements or arrangements that could trigger a requirement for an early payment or that could change the value of our assets. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs through at least the next 12 months, based on the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s near-term cash requirements during 2021 are primarily related to funding operations. For the full year 2021, the Company expects to make capital expenditures of less than $0.5 million. The Company is closely managing its capital spending and will perform capital additions where economically prudent, while continuing to invest strategically for future growth.
As of December 31, 2020, $15.2 million of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents noted above was held in the U.S. and the remainder was held internationally, primarily in Australia ($2.5 million), the U.K. ($2.4 million), Switzerland ($1.6 million), Hong Kong ($1.1 million), China ($1.0 million), and Singapore ($0.6 million). The majority of the Company’s offshore cash is available to it as a source of funds, net of any tax obligations or assessments.
The Company believes that future external market conditions remain uncertain, particularly access to credit, rates of near-term projected economic growth, and levels of unemployment in the markets in which the Company operates. Due to these uncertain external market conditions, the Company cannot provide assurance that its actual cash requirements will not be greater in the future than those currently expected, especially if market conditions deteriorate substantially. If sources of liquidity are not available or if the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations, the Company could be required to obtain additional sources of funds through additional operating improvements, capital market transactions, asset sales or financing from third parties, or a combination of those sources. The Company cannot provide assurance that these additional sources of funds will be available or, if available, would have reasonable terms.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.

Contingencies
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to compliance audits by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign government regulatory, tax, and other authorities relating to a variety of regulations, including wage and hour laws, unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation, immigration, and income, value-added, and sales taxes. The Company is also subject to, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, various claims, lawsuits, and other complaints from, for example, clients, candidates, suppliers, landlords for both leased and subleased properties, former and current employees, and regulators or tax authorities. Periodic events and management actions such as business reorganization initiatives can change the number and type of audits, claims, lawsuits, contract disputes, or complaints asserted against the Company. Events can also change the likelihood of assertion and the behavior of third parties to reach resolution regarding such matters.
The economic conditions in the recent past have given rise to many news reports and bulletins from clients, tax authorities and other parties about changes in their procedures for audits, payment, plans to challenge existing contracts and other such matters aimed at being more aggressive in the resolution of such matters in their own favor. The Company believes that it has appropriate procedures in place for identifying and communicating any matters of this type, whether asserted or likely to be asserted, and it evaluates its liabilities in light of the prevailing circumstances. Changes in the behavior of third parties could cause the Company to change its view of the likelihood of a claim and what might constitute a trend. Employment laws vary in the markets in which we operate, and in some cases, employees and former employees have extended periods during which they may bring claims against the Company.
For matters that reach the threshold of probable and estimable, the Company establishes reserves for legal, regulatory, and other contingent liabilities. The Company’s reserves were $0.0 million as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined, the Company believes that none of the currently pending matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. GAAP provides the framework from which to make these estimates, assumptions and disclosures. We choose accounting policies within GAAP that our management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner. Our management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions. Our accounting policies are stated in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements that are inherently uncertain.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue for our RPO recruitment over time in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to and have an enforceable right to payment in exchange for our services. The client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are provided. The transaction prices contain both fixed fee and variable usage-based consideration. Variable usage-based consideration is constrained by candidates accepting offers of permanent employment. We recognized revenue on the fixed fee as the performance obligations are satisfied and usage-based fees as the constraint is lifted. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain our RPO recruitment contracts. The costs to fulfill these contracts are expensed as incurred.
The Company recognizes revenue for our contracting services over time as services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to and have an enforceable right to payment in exchange for our services, which is generally calculated as hours worked multiplied by the agreed-upon hourly bill rate. The client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are provided. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain our contracting contracts. The costs incurred to fulfill these contracts are expensed as incurred.
As a practical expedient, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an expected original duration of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

The Company’s accounts receivable balances are composed of trade and unbilled receivables. Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recorded in advance of processing formal invoices pursuant to the completion of contract provisions and, generally, become billable at contractually specified dates. Unbilled amounts are expected to be invoiced and collected within one year. The Company records accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved as to the collectability of the various receivables. If the Company determines that the allowance for doubtful accounts is not adequate to cover estimated losses, an expense to provide for doubtful accounts is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. If an account is determined to be uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Management’s assessment and judgment are vital requirements in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness, financial stability and effect of market conditions on each customer.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” This standard establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities. It requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes.
The calculation of net deferred tax assets assumes sufficient future earnings for the realization of such assets as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction. If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time. Our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence, including the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income from operations. The underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment. In the event that actual income from operations differs from forecasted amounts, or if we change our estimates of forecasted income from operations, we could record additional charges or reduce allowances in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their realizable amount. Such adjustments could be material to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information regarding deferred tax assets and valuation allowances.
ASC 740-10-55-3, “Recognition and Measurement of Tax Positions - a Two Step Process,” provides implementation guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a two-step evaluation process for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition and the second is measurement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, disclosures, transition and accounting for interim periods. In addition, ASC 740-10-25-9 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2020, the gross liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $1.1 million.
The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized in the future, would affect the annual effective income tax rate. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. We elected to continue our historical practice of classifying applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
We provide tax reserves for Federal, state, local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Where applicable, associated interest and penalties have also been recognized. Although the outcome relating to these exposures are uncertain, we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. In certain circumstances, the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, including those that cannot be quantified, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions
Business Combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The acquisition method requires identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the business acquired to be recognized and measured at fair value on the acquisition date, which is the date that the acquirer obtains control of the acquired business. The amount by which the fair value of consideration transferred as the purchase price exceeds the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business under the ASC are accounted for as asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition with any consideration in excess of net assets acquired allocated to acquired assets on a relative fair value basis. Transaction costs are expensed in a business combination and are considered a component of the cost of the acquisition in an asset acquisition.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trade names and a non-competition agreement. The Company’s definite-life intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives ranging from two to five years. The Company periodically evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that indicate long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such circumstances are present, the Company assesses whether the carrying value will be recovered though the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset. In the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long-lived asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the long-lived asset’s carrying value over its fair value is recorded in ASC 360-1-35.
Goodwill
The Company records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Coit Staffing Inc. is recognized in the Company's Americas reportable segment. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 1, or when an event or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable and has identified one reporting unit that currently carries a goodwill balance. Goodwill impairment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
The Company still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference.
The Company has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. There was no impairment charge recorded in fiscal year 2020.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company applies the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation.” The Company determines the fair value as of the grant date. Determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company’s stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be different from what has been recorded in the current period.
For awards with graded vesting conditions, the values of the awards are determined by valuing each tranche separately and expensing each tranche over the required service period. The service period is the period over which the related service is performed, which is generally the same as the vesting period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
