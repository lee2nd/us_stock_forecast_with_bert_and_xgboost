Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
We are a vertically-integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. Our two principal operating segments are Vinyls and Olefins. We use the majority of our internally-produced basic chemicals to produce higher value-added chemicals, polymers and building products.
Consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly since we began operations in 1986. Our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value-added chemical products used in many end-markets. Chlor-alkali and petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies. The chlor-alkali and petrochemical industries exhibit cyclical commodity characteristics, and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates, the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials. Due to the significant size of new plants, capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed. The cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of excess new capacity additions.
Westlake is the second-largest chlor-alkali producer and the second-largest PVC producer in the world. Since late 2010, the PVC industry in the U.S. has experienced an increase in PVC resin exports, driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in the U.S. As a consequence, the U.S. PVC resin industry operating rates have improved since 2010. Globally, there were large chlor-alkali capacity additions between 2008 and 2015 resulting in excess capacity and lower industry operating rates, which exerted downward pressure on caustic soda pricing. From 2015 through the end of 2018, the capacity additions have been outpaced by an increase in demand driven by improving economic growth and U.S. producers' competitive export position, which resulted in improved operating rates and caustic soda pricing. Since the end of 2018, the uncertainties surrounding international trade have impacted both domestic and export prices for our products. Global demand for most of our products strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2020, and we expect global demand for most of our products to remain robust into early 2021. Depending on the performance of the global economy, potential changes in international trade and tariffs policies, the trend of crude oil prices, the timing of the new capacity additions in 2021 and beyond, and the sustainability of the current, strong demand for most of our products, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively or positively impacted.
Ethane-based ethylene producers have in the recent past experienced a cost advantage over naphtha-based ethylene producers during periods of higher crude oil prices. This cost advantage has resulted in a strong export market for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives and has benefited operating margins and cash flows for our Olefins segment during such periods. However, we have seen a significant reduction in the cost advantage enjoyed by North American ethane-based ethylene producers due to lower crude oil prices from the third quarter of 2014 through 2020, which has resulted in reduced prices and lower margins for our Olefins segment. Further, our Olefins segment has experienced lower profitability in recent periods due to several new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America and Asia that have led to additional supply of ethylene and polyethylene. In the past year, we have seen volatility in ethane and ethylene prices, primarily due to changes in demand resulting from the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, anticipated timing for certain new ethylene capacity additions and availability of natural gas liquids, as well as fluctuation in the price of crude oil. Global demand for most of our products strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2020, and we expect global demand for most of our products to remain robust into early 2021. However, new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America, Asia and the Middle East will add additional supply and may continue to contribute to periods of lower profitability in our Olefins segment.
We purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains. We also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. While we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene, salt and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. Factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past, and which may do so in the future include:
•the availability of feedstock from shale gas and oil drilling;
•supply and demand for crude oil;
•shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand;
•ethane and liquefied natural gas exports;
•capacity constraints due to higher construction costs for investments, construction delays, strike action or involuntary shutdowns;
•the general level of business and economic activity; and
•the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.
Significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. Conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices. We currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs. Normally, there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived. When this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms, we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship.
Our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity, our efficient use of that capacity and our ability to increase capacity. Since our inception, we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions, new plant construction and internal expansion. We evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs. We also regularly look at acquisition opportunities that would be consistent with, or complimentary to, our overall business strategies. Depending on the size of the acquisition, any such acquisitions could require external financing.
As noted above in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. Further, concerns about GHG emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations, and to proposed legislation and additional regulations, that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel, other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products. While we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The body of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is commonly referred to as "GAAP." For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the SEC as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that (1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or (2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this report, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this Form 10-K are not substitutes for the GAAP measures of earnings and cash flows.
EBITDA is included in this Form 10-K because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using EBITDA. In addition, we utilize EBITDA in evaluating acquisition targets. Management also believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and EBITDA is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. EBITDA is not a substitute for the GAAP measures of net income, income from operations and net cash provided by operating activities and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. In addition, it should be noted that companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented for us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization and income taxes.
Significant Developments
COVID-19, Industry Conditions and Our Business
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The pandemic has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy. We experienced significant disruptions in the second quarter of 2020 as the pandemic and its impact on the global economy spread through most of our markets. While demand for some of our products used in cleaning, packaging and medical applications and manufacturing continues to be firm, we expected lower demand for certain of our other products that led us to proactively temporarily idle production at several of our smaller non-integrated plants and reduce operating rates at others in the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. Since the middle of the second quarter of 2020, a general ease in government restrictions in many jurisdictions across the world has resulted in a gradual increase in demand for our products. As a result, all of our idled plants recommenced production. Operating rates have improved over the course of the third and the fourth quarters of 2020 for most of our plants due to continuing increase in demand for our products. For a discussion of the additional impact on plant operating rates from hurricanes in the second half of 2020, see "Impact of Hurricanes Laura and Delta" below. We continue to monitor the volatile environment and may reduce operating rates or idle production if the pandemic and its financial impacts persist or worsen. Considering the uncertain and volatile environment, we could continue to experience significant disruptions to our business operations in the near future.
Our first priority in our response to this crisis has been the health and safety of our employees and those of our customers and vendors. We have implemented preventative measures and developed corporate and regional response plans to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure. We have modified certain business practices (including those related to employee travel, employee work locations and employee work practices) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and other governmental and health authorities.
Though the government restrictions across the world generally started to ease in the later part of the second quarter of 2020, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns (whether through a continuation of existing measures or the re-imposition of prior measures). Certain parts of the world may see the implementation of new government restrictions due to a recent increase in COVID-19 cases. Restrictions of this nature have caused, and may continue to cause, us and our customers to experience reduced demand and operational delays. Lockdowns across the world and curtailed business activities specifically in transportation, construction, automotive and oil and gas related activities have resulted in and may continue to result in an oversupplied market.
Due to the sudden collapse of crude oil prices in early March 2020, the cost advantage of North American ethane-based ethylene producers over naphtha-based ethylene producers has been significantly eroded. We started seeing impact from this erosion towards the end of the first quarter of 2020. Crude oil prices have recovered somewhat since the second quarter of 2020, and the cost advantage of North American ethane-based ethylene producers has improved as well. If this trend is not sustained in the future, it could continue to result in reduced prices and lower margins for some of our products in the Vinyls segment and the Olefins segment.
We have taken proactive actions to respond to the challenges presented by the conditions described above and minimize the impact to our business. We have implemented strategies to reduce costs, increase operational efficiencies, maintain strong liquidity and lower our capital spending. Additionally, we deferred the planned turnaround at our Petro 2 ethylene unit and associated maintenance cost into the second half of 2021. The turnaround is expected to last approximately 60 days.
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had $1,313 million of cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet, which remains available to support our operations, in addition to the $1 billion of availability under the Credit Agreement. On June 4, 2020, we fully repaid our borrowings of $1 billion under the Credit Agreement from March 20, 2020.
The impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, including, among others, the ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to prevent the spread of the virus, the development of effective treatments and vaccines and their roll out, the duration of the outbreak, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.
CARES Act
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act, among other things, permits any federal net operating loss ("NOL") generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of the federal NOL to fully offset taxable income to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. However, any such federal NOL not carried back can be carried forward to fully offset taxable income, but only for the taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, after which, the federal NOL deduction limitation not to exceed 80% of taxable income under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") will be reinstated. Federal NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 measured at the current U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% that are carried back to taxable years prior to the Tax Act to fully offset taxable income taxed at the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% result in an income tax rate benefit. At the end of 2019, we generated a federal NOL primarily due to bonus tax depreciation from the Company's investment in LACC, LLC ("LACC"), which is accounted for as an equity method investment. This federal NOL was increased to account for the disallowed interest deduction which originated in 2019 that is no longer disallowed due to the increase in the business interest expense deduction limitation from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income for tax years 2019 and 2020 as permitted under the CARES Act. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the carryback of the federal NOL resulted in a net tax benefit of $95 million for the Company, primarily from the tax rate difference, partially offset by the reduction in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 ("Section 199") domestic manufacturing deduction.
3.375% Senior Notes due 2030
On June 12, 2020, we completed the registered public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt" below and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information.
6 ½% GO Zone Senior Notes due 2029, 6 ½% GO Zone Senior Notes due 2035 and IKE Zone Senior Notes due 2035
On August 1, 2020, the Company purchased in lieu of optional redemption $100 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest to August 1, 2020. The 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds were offered by the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (the "Authority") in July 2010 under the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (the "GO Zone Act") for the benefit of the Company and bore interest at a rate of 6.50% per annum. In connection with the offering of the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds in July 2010, the Company issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Senior Notes to evidence and secure the Company's obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement relating to the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds. In connection with the purchase in lieu of optional redemption of the 2029 GO Zone Bonds, the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Senior Notes were cancelled. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes was used to fund the purchase in lieu of optional redemption of the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds.
On November 1, 2020, the Company purchased in lieu of optional redemption (1) $89 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Bonds, and (2) $65 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 ½% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds (together with the 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Bonds, the "2035 Revenue Bonds"), in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2035 Revenue Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest to November 1, 2020. The 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Bonds were issued by the Authority in December 2010 under the GO Zone Act for the benefit of the Company and bore interest at a rate of 6.50% per annum. The 6 ½% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds were issued by the Authority in December 2010 under Section 704 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 for the benefit of the Company and bore interest at a rate of 6.50% per annum. In connection with the offering of the 2035 Revenue Bonds in December 2010, the Company issued $89 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes and $65 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 ½% 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes to evidence and secure the Company's obligations under the Loan Agreements relating to the 2035 Revenue Bonds. In connection with the purchase of the 2035 Revenue Bonds by the Company in lieu of optional redemption, the 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes and the 6 ½% 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes were cancelled. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes was used to fund the purchase in lieu of optional redemption of the 2035 Revenue Bonds.
Impact of Hurricanes Laura and Delta
On August 27, 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm, which resulted in widespread damage to property and infrastructure in the greater Lake Charles area, including the electricity transmission system. As a precautionary measure, Westlake idled its facilities in the Lake Charles area in advance of Hurricane Laura. As a result of Hurricane Laura, most of Westlake's facilities in the Lake Charles area were shut down starting the last week of August 2020 and remained shut down through much of September 2020. On October 9, 2020, Hurricane Delta made landfall as a Category 2 storm in the same general vicinity of Louisiana. Several facilities that had resumed production at the end of September 2020 then had to idle production as a result of Hurricane Delta. All of these facilities resumed production in November 2020. The shut downs resulted in additional maintenance expense of approximately $83 million in 2020 and lower plant operating rates and lower production for many of our major products in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
Schkopau Plant Closure
During September 2020, the Company initiated consultations with the works council at its Schkopau, Germany site regarding the closure of the site's paste polyvinyl chloride plant and the plant was shut down in December 2020. The decision was driven by the plant's lack of long-term economic viability. The Company took an accounting charge of $34 million in the third quarter of 2020 associated with the closure. Customers will continue to be supplied from the Company's larger, backward-integrated sites at Burghausen, Gendorf and Cologne, Germany.
February Weather Event
In February 2021, large parts of the southern United States, including Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Mississippi, experienced extreme winter weather. Due to the extreme weather, several of our facilities in the region experienced disruption to their operations, resulting in lost production and additional maintenance costs.

Summary
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation was $330 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, on net sales of $7,504 million. This represents a decrease in net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $91 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to 2019 net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $421 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,118 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased versus the prior year primarily due to lower global sales prices for several of our major products, including caustic soda, and lower sales volumes for caustic soda resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower crude oil prices. Net income for 2020 was also impacted by the shutdowns of our Lake Charles facilities in the second half of 2020 due to Hurricanes Laura and Delta, which resulted in lower plant operating rates, higher maintenance expense and lower production for many of our major products. In addition, in 2020 we had a higher interest expense related to higher average borrowings. These decreases were partially offset by the income tax rate benefit of $95 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, resulting from the carryback of federal net operating losses permitted by the CARES Act, higher sales volumes for downstream building products, higher contributions from our ethylene joint venture LACC, LLC ("LACC") and lower fuel costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. Income from operations was $429 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $656 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $227 million. The decrease in income from operations was primarily due to lower global sales prices for our major products, lower sales volume for caustic soda, lower operating rates and higher maintenance expense due to Hurricanes Laura and Delta. The decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes for downstream building products and higher contributions from LACC, lower fuel costs and selling, general and administrative costs. Net sales decreased by $614 million to $7,504 million in 2020 from $8,118 million in 2019, mainly due to lower sales prices and volumes for several of our major products, including caustic soda, partially offset by higher sales volumes for downstream building products.
2020 Compared with 2019
Net Sales. Net sales decreased by $614 million, or 8%, to $7,504 million in 2020 from $8,118 million in 2019, primarily attributable to lower sales prices and volumes for several of our major products, including caustic soda, partially offset by higher sales volumes for downstream building products. Average sales prices for 2020 decreased by 4% as compared to 2019 due to slower global economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower crude oil prices. Sales volumes decreased by 3% in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Gross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage decreased to 14% in 2020 from 16% in 2019. The gross profit margin decreased primarily due to lower global sales prices for several of our major products and lower sales volumes for caustic soda resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower crude oil prices. Gross profit margin was also impacted by the shutdown of our Lake Charles facilities in the second half of 2020 due to Hurricanes Laura and Delta, which resulted in lower plant operating rates, higher maintenance expense and lower production for many of our major products. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes for downstream building products and lower fuel costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9 million to $449 million in 2020 from $458 million in 2019. This decrease was mainly due to lower employee compensation and selling expenses.
Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization expense for 2020 was $109 million, which was comparable to $109 million for 2019.
Restructuring, Transaction and Integration-related Costs. Restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs were $36 million in 2020 as compared to $37 million in 2019. The restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs for 2020 primarily related to the closure of the non-integrated PVC plant located in Germany and included the $8 million write-off of certain assets and other expenses associated with the plant closure. The restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs for 2019 primarily consisted of restructuring expenses of $26 million and acquisition costs.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $18 million to $142 million in 2020 from $124 million in 2019, primarily as a result of higher average debt outstanding in 2020 as compared to 2019. The higher average debt balance in 2020 was primarily due to the borrowing of $1 billion under our revolving credit facility in March 2020 out of an abundance of caution (which we fully repaid in June 2020), the issuance of the €700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% 2029 Senior Notes in July 2019, which were outstanding for the full calendar year in 2020 (as compared to less than half a year in 2019), and the issuance of the $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes in June 2020 and lower interest capitalization due to lower activity with respect to capital expenditure projects during 2020 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the purchase in lieu of redemption of the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds, the 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Bonds and the 6 ½% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt" below and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further discussion of our indebtedness.
Other Income, Net. Other income, net of $44 million in 2020 was higher as compared to other income, net of $38 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher expected return on pension plan assets.
Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 13% in 2020 as compared to an expense of 19% in 2019. The change in effective tax rate in 2020 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the income tax rate benefit resulting from the carryback of federal net operating loss to taxable years that were taxed at the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% as permitted under the CARES Act, partially offset by the reduction in the Section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction as a result of the net operating loss carryback.
Vinyls Segment
Net Sales. Net sales for the Vinyls segment decreased by $364 million, or 6%, to $5,972 million in 2020 from $6,336 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, partially offset by higher sales volumes for downstream building products, as compared to the prior year. Average sales prices for the Vinyls segment decreased by 4% in 2020, as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower global economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Average sales volumes decreased by 2% in 2020, as compared to 2019.
Income from Operations. Income from operations for the Vinyls segment decreased by $150 million to $301 million in 2020 from $451 million in 2019. This decrease in income from operations was due to lower sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, mainly resulting from slower global economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in income from operations versus the prior year was also due to higher maintenance expense and other costs related to lower production, in each case due to Hurricanes Laura and Delta. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes for downstream building products, higher contributions from LACC and lower fuel costs.
Olefins Segment
Net Sales. Net sales for the Olefins segment decreased by $250 million, or 14%, to $1,532 million in 2020 from $1,782 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales prices for our major products. Our sales volumes were also impacted by the lower production due to Hurricanes Laura and Delta. Sales volumes for the Olefins segment decreased by 7% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment decreased by 7% in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to lower global economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower crude oil prices.
Income from Operations. Income from operations for the Olefins segment decreased by $100 million to $160 million in 2020 from $260 million in 2019. The decrease in income from operations was due to the lower sales prices for our major products, mainly resulting from lower crude oil prices and slower global economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in income from operations versus the prior year was also due to lower sales volumes for many of our major products, higher maintenance expense and other costs related to lower production, in each case due to Hurricanes Laura and Delta. Trading activity in 2020 resulted in a gain of approximately $4 million as compared to a loss of $26 million in 2019.
2019 Compared with 2018
Net Sales. Net sales decreased by $517 million, or 6%, to $8,118 million in 2019 from $8,635 million in 2018, primarily attributable to lower sales prices for our major products and lower sales volumes for PVC resin, partially offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene, styrene and PVC compounds. Average sales prices for 2019 decreased by 11% as compared to 2018. Sales volumes increased by 5% in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Gross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage decreased to 16% in 2019 from 23% in 2018. The gross profit margin decreased primarily due to lower sales prices for our major products (resulting in lower margins), partially offset by lower ethane feedstock, purchased ethylene and fuel costs, as compared to 2018.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13 million to $458 million in 2019 from $445 million in 2018. This increase was mainly due to selling, general and administrative expenses related to the acquisition of NAKAN, partially offset by lower professional consulting fees.
Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization expense for 2019 was $109 million, as compared to $101 million for 2018. The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to intangible assets related to the acquisition of NAKAN.
Restructuring, Transaction and Integration-related Costs. Restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs of $37 million in 2019 were higher as compared to $33 million in 2018. The restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs for 2019 primarily consisted of restructuring expenses of $26 million and acquisition costs. The restructuring expenses primarily represent charges associated with the write-off of certain assets. The restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs for 2018 of $33 million primarily consisted of integration-related consulting fees and acquisition costs.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $2 million to $124 million in 2019 from $126 million in 2018, primarily as a result of a lower average interest rate for the outstanding debt in 2019 as compared to 2018. The lower average interest rate was primarily due to the redemption of the 4.875% 2023 Notes and the 4.625% 2021 Notes in 2018 and the issuance of the 1.625% 2029 Senior Notes in July 2019.
Other Income, Net. Other income, net decreased by $14 million to $38 million in 2019 from $52 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million in 2018.
Income Taxes. The effective income tax expense rate was 19% in 2019 as compared to 22% in 2018. The effective tax rate in 2019 was lower as compared to 2018 and lower compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the reduction of a valuation allowance recorded against foreign NOL and credit carryforwards and the reduction in accrual of withholding tax on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by an increase in state tax expense.
Vinyls Segment
Net Sales. Net sales for the Vinyls segment decreased by $280 million, or 4%, to $6,336 million in 2019 from $6,616 million in 2018. Average sales prices for the Vinyls segment decreased by 8% in 2019, as compared to 2018, mainly due to lower sales prices for caustic soda and lower sales prices and volumes for PVC resins, partially offset by higher PVC compounds sales volumes. Average sales volumes increased by 3% in 2019, as compared to 2018.
Income from Operations. Income from operations for the Vinyls segment decreased by $462 million to $451 million in 2019 from $913 million in 2018. This decrease in income from operations was primarily due to lower caustic soda and PVC resin sales prices, partially offset by lower purchased ethylene, ethane feedstock and fuel costs.
Olefins Segment
Net Sales. Net sales for the Olefins segment decreased by $237 million, or 12%, to $1,782 million in 2019 from $2,019 million in 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales prices for our major products, partially offset by higher polyethylene and styrene sales volumes, as compared to 2018. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment decreased by 21% in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to increased olefins production from new industry capacity. Sales volumes for the Olefins segment increased by 9% in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Income from Operations. Income from operations for the Olefins segment decreased by $313 million to $260 million in 2019 from $573 million in 2018. The decrease in income from operations was primarily due to the lower sales prices for our major products, partially offset by higher sales volumes for our major products and lower feedstock and fuel costs. Trading activity in 2019 resulted in a loss of approximately $26 million as compared to a gain of $3 million in 2018.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Operating activities provided cash of $1,297 million in 2020, as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1,301 million in 2019. The changes in cash flows from operating activities in 2020, as compared to 2019, were mainly driven by the decrease in income from operations, the income tax refund of $188 million under the CARES Act and working capital changes. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, used cash of $17 million in 2020, as compared to $68 million of cash provided in 2019, an unfavorable change of $85 million. Unfavorable changes in working capital were due to a change in accounts receivable, which was driven by higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the expected additional income tax refund resulting from the CARES Act, as discussed previously. Favorable changes in working capital were due to lower inventories and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, primarily driven by the changes in inventory levels and operating activities.
Operating activities provided cash of $1,301 million in 2019 as compared to cash provided of $1,409 million in 2018. The $108 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to the decrease in income from operations in 2019, as compared to 2018, partially offset by a decrease in working capital requirements. Income from operations decreased by $752 million in 2019, as compared to 2018. The decrease in income from operations was primarily a result of lower sales prices for our major products, partially offset by lower purchased ethylene, ethane and fuel costs. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $68 million in 2019, as compared to $290 million of cash used in 2018, a favorable change of $358 million. The favorable change was driven mainly by changes in accounts receivable and inventories. Favorable changes in accounts receivables and inventories were primarily the result of lower sales prices for our products and lower feedstock costs in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities during 2020 was $509 million as compared to net cash used of $1,954 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $525 million in 2020 compared to $787 million in 2019. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to fewer expansion projects in 2020, as compared to 2019. Capital expenditures in 2020 were primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety projects and environmental projects at our various facilities. In 2020, we received $44 million from our joint venture, LACC, representing a return of investment. The Company's contribution to unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2020 was primarily comprised of $14 million towards our investment in RS Cogen. Investing activities in 2019 were primarily due to acquisitions for $314 million, net of cash acquired, the purchase of the additional 34.8% interest in LACC for $817 million in November 2019 and payment of $45 million to fund the construction costs of LACC. Capital expenditures in 2019 included certain announced expansion projects as well as projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities.
Net cash used for investing activities during 2019 was $1,954 million as compared to net cash used of $754 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $787 million in 2019 compared to $702 million in 2018. Higher investing activities in 2019 were primarily due to acquisitions for $314 million, net of cash acquired, the purchase of the additional 34.8% interest in LACC for $817 million in November 2019 and payment of $45 million to fund the construction costs of LACC. Capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to expansion projects as well as projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. The expansion projects include our previously announced expansions of PVC and VCM capacities at our plants in Germany and Geismar, Louisiana.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities during 2020 was $216 million as compared to net cash provided of $630 million in 2019. In 2020, out of abundance of caution, we borrowed $1,000 million under our revolving credit facility, which we subsequently fully repaid in June 2020. In 2020, we completed the registered public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes and we purchased in lieu of optional redemption the $100 million 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Senior Notes, the $89 million 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes and the $65 million 6 ½% 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes. The remaining activities in 2020 were primarily related to the $137 million payment of cash dividends, the $55 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, repurchases of common stock of $54 million and repayment of short-term notes payable of $17 million. In 2019, we received proceeds of $784 million from the issuance of the 1.625% 2029 Senior Notes and $63 million from the issuance of Westlake Partners common units. The remaining activities in 2019 were primarily related to the $132 million payment of cash dividends, the $50 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and repurchases of common stock of $30 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was $630 million as compared to net cash used of $1,427 million in 2018. In 2019, we received proceeds of $784 million from the issuance of the 1.625% 2029 Senior Notes and $63 million from the issuance of Westlake Partners common units. The remaining activities in 2019 were primarily related to the $132 million payment of cash dividends, the $50 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and repurchases of common stock of $30 million. The 2018 activity was mainly related to the redemption of $704 million principal amount of the 2021 Notes in February 2018 and the redemption of $461 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes in May 2018. The remaining activities in 2018 were primarily related to the $120 million payment of cash dividends, the $45 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and repurchases of common stock of $106 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity and Financing Arrangements
Our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our long-term financing.
In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program (the "2014 Program"). In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. In August 2018, our Board of Directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had repurchased 7,075,720 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $419 million under the 2014 Program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 995,529 shares of our common stock were repurchased under the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 Program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, general market conditions and other factors. The 2014 Program may be discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time.
On October 4, 2018, Westlake Partners and Westlake Partners GP, the general partner of Westlake Partners, entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC to offer and sell Westlake Partners common units, from time to time, up to an aggregate offering amount of $50 million. This Equity Distribution Agreement was amended on February 28, 2020 to reference a new shelf registration for utilization under this agreement. No common units have been issued under this program in 2018, 2019 or 2020.
On March 20, 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we borrowed $1 billion under our $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023 (the "Credit Agreement") to maintain financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets caused by COVID-19. On June 4, 2020, we fully repaid the $1 billion of borrowings under the Credit Agreement and, as a result, have no current borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
On June 12, 2020, we closed the public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes was used to fund the purchase in lieu of optional redemption of (1) $100 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 GO Zone Bonds, (2) $89 million aggregate principal amount of the 2035 GO Zone Bonds and (3) $65 million aggregate principal amount of the 2035 IKE Zone Bonds.
As discussed in more detail above under 'Significant Developments', the Company (i) purchased in lieu of optional redemption $100 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 GO Zone Bonds on August 1, 2020, and in connection therewith, the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Senior Notes were cancelled, and (ii) purchased in lieu of optional redemption (1) $89 million aggregate principal amount of the 2035 GO Zone Bonds and (2) $65 million aggregate principal amount of the 2035 IKE Zone Bonds, in each case, on November 1, 2020, and in connection therewith, the 6 ½% 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes and the 6 ½% 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes were cancelled.
We believe that our sources of liquidity as described above are adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures. Funding of any potential large expansions or potential acquisitions would likely necessitate, and therefore depend on our ability to obtain, additional financing in the future. We may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,313 million. In addition, we have the Credit Agreement available to supplement cash if needed, as described under "Debt" below.
Debt
As of December 31, 2020, our indebtedness totaled $3,566 million. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness. Defined terms used in this section have the definitions assigned to such terms in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future.
Credit Agreement
On July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023 (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement bears interest at either (a) LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% or (b) Alternate Base Rate plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% in each case depending on the credit rating of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding letters of credit and had borrowing availability of $1 billion under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant.
The Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default and if and for so long as certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, any overdue amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the lenders can terminate their commitments thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the lenders. None of our subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement includes a $150 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for a discretionary $50 million commitment for swingline loans to be provided on a same-day basis. We may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least $25 million, up to a maximum of $500 million, subject to certain conditions and if certain lenders agree to commit to such an increase.
In connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, all guarantees by our then subsidiaries of our payment obligations under the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes, the 3.50% 2032 GO Zone Refunding Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were released.
3.60% Senior Notes due 2022
In July 2012, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes. We may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes at any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date) for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted "make whole" payment. On or after April 15, 2022, we may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest. The holders of the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon the occurrence of both a "change of control" and, within 60 days of such change of control, a "below investment grade rating event" (as such terms are defined in the indenture governing the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes).
3.60% Senior Notes due 2026 and 5.0% Senior Notes due 2046
In August 2016, we completed the private offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes. In March 2017, the Company commenced registered exchange offers to exchange the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes for new notes that are identical in all material respects to the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, except that the offer and issuance of the new Securities and Exchange Commission-registered notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The exchange offers expired on April 24, 2017, and approximately 99.97% of the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and 100% of the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were exchanged. The notes that were not exchanged in the exchange offers have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities law.
Revenue Bonds
In December 1997, we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana. The public trust issued $11 million principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. The waste disposal revenue bonds expire in December 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. Interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. The interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 0.14% and 1.78%, respectively.
1.625% Senior Notes due 2029
In July 2019, we completed the registered public offering of €700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% 2029 Senior Notes due July 17, 2029.

GO Zone Bonds and IKE Zone Bonds
In November 2017, the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facility and Development Authority (the "Authority") completed the offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% tax-exempt revenue refunding bonds due November 1, 2032 (the "Refunding Bonds"), the net proceeds of which were used to redeem $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Authority's 6 ¾% tax-exempt revenue bonds due November 1, 2032 issued by the Authority under the GO Zone Act in December 2007. In connection with the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, we issued $250 million of the 3.5% 2032 GO Zone Refunding Senior Notes. The Refunding Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time on or after November 1, 2027, for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest.
In July 2010, the Authority completed the reoffering of $100 million of the 6 ½% 2029 GO Zone Bonds.

4.375% Senior Notes due 2047
In November 2017, we completed the registered public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due November 15, 2047.

The indenture governing the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes, the 1.625% 2029 Senior Notes, the 3.375% 2030 Senior Notes, the 3.5% 2032 Senior Notes, the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, and the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes, contain customary events of default and covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict us and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our long-term debt covenants.
Westlake Chemical Partners LP Credit Arrangements
Our subsidiary, Westlake Chemical Finance Corporation, is the lender party to a $600 million revolving credit facility with Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners"), originally entered into on April 29, 2015 and amended in August and December 2017. In addition, on March 19, 2020, Westlake Partners and Westlake Chemical Finance Corporation entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility, to extend the maturity date to March 19, 2023 and add a phase-out provision for LIBOR, which is to be replaced by an alternate benchmark rate. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% (depending on Westlake Partners' consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. Westlake Partners may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled $377 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%.
Our subsidiary, Westlake Polymers LLC, is the administrative agent to a $600 million revolving credit facility with OpCo. The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in September 2023. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $23 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%, which is accrued in arrears quarterly.
We consolidate Westlake Partners and OpCo for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. As such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and Westlake Partners and OpCo are eliminated upon consolidation.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
In addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 relating to long-term debt, operating leases, finance leases, pension benefits funding, post-retirement healthcare benefits, purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter. The amounts do not include deferred charges and other items classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of the future payment schedule.
Pension Benefits Funding. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our defined benefit pension plans which cover certain eligible employees in the United States and non-U.S. countries.
Post-retirement Healthcare Benefits. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our post-retirement healthcare benefits to the employees of certain subsidiaries who meet certain minimum age and service requirements.
Purchase Obligations. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including a minimum quantity and price. We are party to various obligations to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various feedstock, utilities, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage, pipeline usage and logistic support, in each case in the ordinary course of our business, as well as various purchase commitments for our capital projects. The amounts shown in the table above reflect our estimates based on the contractual quantities and the prices in effect under contractual agreements as of December 31, 2020.
Interest Payments. Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020.
Asset Retirement Obligations. This includes the estimated costs and timing of payments to satisfy our recognized asset retirement obligations.
Standby Letters of Credit. This includes (1) our obligation under an $11 million letter of credit issued in connection with the $11 million tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and (2) other letters of credit totaling $12 million issued primarily to support commercial obligations and obligations under our insurance programs, including workers' compensation claims.
Uncertain Income Tax Positions. We have recognized a liability for our uncertain income tax positions of approximately $17 million as of December 31, 2020. We do not believe we are likely to pay any material amounts during the year ending December 31, 2021. The ultimate resolution and timing of payment for remaining matters continues to be uncertain and are therefore excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.
We apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, fair value estimates, accruals for long-term employee benefits, accounts receivable, income taxes and environmental and legal obligations. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.
Long-Lived Assets. Key estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. Such estimates could be significantly modified. The carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the United States and world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions.
We evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. Actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from one to 40 years. Depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of deferred turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $773 million, $713 million and $641 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation or amortization charges would be accelerated.
We defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit. Total costs deferred on turnarounds were $24 million, $40 million and $79 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization in 2020, 2019 and 2018 of previously deferred turnaround costs was $48 million, $55 million and $39 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, deferred turnaround costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $102 million. Expensing turnaround costs as incurred would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
Additional information concerning long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in Notes 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Fair Value Estimates. We develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record marketable securities and pension plan assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the engagement of third-party consultants. At December 31, 2020, our recorded goodwill was $1,083 million. In addition, we record all pension plan assets and certain marketable securities at fair value. The fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market-based inputs. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information.
Business Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted in the same period's financial statements, including the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment assessment for the Olefins and Vinyls reporting units in October and April, respectively. We may elect to perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment analysis is required. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors related to raw materials and labor, current and projected financial performance, changes in management or strategy, and market capitalization. Alternatively, we may unconditionally elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in any period.
We elected to perform the quantitative assessment for both of our segments' reporting units during 2020. The quantitative analysis compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The fair values of the reporting units are calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. The discounted cash flow projections are based on a forecast to reflect the cyclicality of the business. The forecast is based on historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans, and financial performance of the market. The future cash flows are discounted to present value using an applicable discount rate. The significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of EBITDA a willing buyer is likely to pay. Even if the fair values of the reporting units decreased by 10% from the fair values determined in the most recent quantitative tests performed during 2020, the carrying values of the reporting units would not have exceeded their fair values. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant."
The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
Long-Term Employee Benefit Costs. Our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits, are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is our responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties. It is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and, if necessary, adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors.
Accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match, for each employee, that estimated cost to the period worked. To accomplish this, we rely extensively on advice from actuaries, and we make assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded. Changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts. One of the more significant assumptions relates to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations. At December 31, 2020, the projected pension benefit obligations for U.S. and non-U.S. plans were calculated using assumed weighted average discount rates of 2.1% and 0.8%, respectively. The discount rates were determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate. As a result of the funding relief provided by the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, no minimum funding requirements are expected during 2021 for the U.S. pension plans. Additional information on the 2021 funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
The following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligation of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:
A one-percentage point increase or decrease in assumed healthcare trend rates would not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans.
While we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.
Income Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Additional information on income taxes appears in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Environmental and Legal Obligations. We consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings. We accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. While we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Asset Retirement Obligations. We recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Initially, the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. The liability is recorded at its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. We have conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of our manufacturing facilities. Additional information on asset retirement obligations appears in Note 1, under Asset Retirement Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
We also have conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. Settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period.
