ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to exercise its judgment. We exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. Areas in which we exercise significant judgment include, but are not necessarily limited to, our valuation of accounts receivable, inventory, income taxes, equity transactions (compensatory and financing) and contingencies. We have also adopted certain polices with respect to our recognition of revenue that we believe are consistent with the guidance provided under Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104.
We base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic conditions, the attributes of our products, the regulatory environment, and in certain cases, the results of outside appraisals. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary.
While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.
For a Summary of Critical Accounting Policies, please refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3.
Results of Continuing Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended March 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue
The following table shows our consolidated total revenue and revenue by geographic region for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:
The decrease in United States revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same periods in the prior year of ($2,572,000), is primarily the result of a decrease in dermatology revenue as the result of the effects of COVID-19 on our business and the associated restructuring of our sales team in response to COVID-19. Revenue for acute care products and other indications declined slightly from the prior year, offset by increases in revenue for our animal care products of $658,000.
As a result of the asset purchase agreement and arrangement we entered into on October 27, 2016 with Invekra, we were obligated to supply Invekra with product at a reduced price through October 27, 2020. We processed orders from Invekra through March 2021 and we expect fewer future orders as Invekra transitions to their own manufacturing. We anticipate that we will continue to manufacture for Invekra after March 2021 in smaller amounts as an overflow manufacturer. However, we will charge market prices for manufacturing after October 27, 2020. The increase in Latin America revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year periods, was the result of large orders for our products from Invekra at cost, prior to contract expiration. We expect that once Invekra starts manufacturing on their own the revenues in Latin America will drop significantly in future periods.
The increase in Europe and Rest of the World revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year was the result of increases in Europe and the Middle East partially offset by decreases in Asia.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit
The cost of revenue and gross profit metrics are as follows:
The gross margin decrease for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020 is the result of product mix, associated with higher sales to Invekra at a lower margin and higher product sales to distributors versus sales through our direct sales force which tend to have higher net selling prices and thus higher margins. Although distributor sales typically have lower margins they don’t require the higher operating expenses associated with a dedicated sales force.
Research and Development Expense
The research and development metrics are as follows:
For the year ended March 31, 2021, research and development expenses decreased as a result the closure of our research and development facility in Seattle, Washington and its relocation to our facility in Mexico.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
The selling, general and administrative expense metrics are as follows:
The decline in Selling, General and Administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2021 was the result of result of reduction in sales force and closing of our Petaluma facility and moving our corporate offices to Woodstock, Georgia.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $12,000 and $16,000, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.
Interest Income
Interest income for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $16,000, compared to $50,000, for the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to interest income reported related to a discount on deferred revenue from our agreement with Invekra.
Other (Expense) Income
Other (expense) income for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $(594,000) compared to $240,000 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in other expense relates primarily to losses in foreign exchange which was approximately $690,000 for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to gains in foreign exchange of $306,000 for the year ended March 31, 2020.
Gain on Sale of Assets
Gain on the sale of assets for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $137,000. We sold fixed assets no longer needed after closing our Petaluma manufacturing facility. For the year ended March 31, 2020 we reported income related to the sale of certain assets to Petagon in the amount of $2,472,000, as well as the sale of assets to MicroSafe in the amount of $1,100,000.
Income Tax
Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $713,000 compared to $29,000 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in income tax expense is the result of tax expense incurred by our Mexico subsidiary primarily as result of the inability to deduct interest on its intercompany debt due to the Mexico thin-cap rules.
Net Loss from Continuing Operations
Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, was $4,615,000 and $3,573,000, respectively. The increase for the current year is due to gains $3,572,000 from the sale of assets to Petagon and Microsafe for the year ended March 31, 2020.
Results of Discontinued Operations
Comparison of Year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020
On June 24, 2020, we closed on an asset purchase agreement with Infinity Labs SD, Inc. We decided to divest our Micromed business, resulting in a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the divested Micromed operations meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations.
The related assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows for our Micromed business are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
The operations of the Micromed business included in discontinued operations is summarized as follows:
Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2021, includes $770,000 of gain primarily from the value of the customer base of Micromed partially offset by a working capital adjustment.
Net Loss
The following table provides the net loss for each period along with the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We reported a net loss of $3,950,000 for the year ended March 31, 2021. We reported a net loss of $3,308,000 for the year ended March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit amounted to $179,277,000 and $175,327,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,220,000 compared to $3,691,000 on March 31, 2020. Since our inception, substantially all of our operations have been financed through sales of equity securities. Other sources of financing that we have used to date include our revenues, as well as various loans and the sale of certain assets to Invekra, Petagon, Microsafe and Infinity Labs.
Since April 1, 2020, substantially all of our operations have been financed through the following transactions:
· Proceeds of $2,287,000 received from the exercise of stock options and warrants;
· Loan proceeds of $1,310,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program disbursed on May 1, 2020; and
· Net proceeds of $610,000 from the sale of our Micromed Laboratories division which closed on June 24, 2020.
The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 as well balances of cash and cash equivalents and working capital:
(1) Defined as current assets minus current liabilities.
As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,220,000, compared to $3,691,000 as of March 31, 2020.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2021 was $3,378,000, primarily due to a net loss of $3,950,000 for the period.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2020 was $4,591,000, primarily due to the gain on sale of assets related to Petagon and Microsafe totaling $3,572,000, an increase in our accounts receivable of $2,190,000, and our net loss of $3,308,000, partially offset by stock-based compensation of $839,000 and a provision for doubtful accounts of $1,004,000.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $388,000, primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of our Micromed division of $610,000 partially offset by the purchase of equipment.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $3,644,000 for the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily related to proceeds from the sale of assets to Petagon and Microsafe of 3,800,000 partially offset by purchases of equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $3,308,000, primarily related to proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of $2,287,000, and PPP loans of $1,310,000 partially offset by payments on long term debt.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,029,000 for the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily related to net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $1,376,000, offset by principal payments of debt and financing leases of $347,000.
We expect revenues to fluctuate and may incur losses in the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital to pursue our product development initiatives, to penetrate markets for the sale of our products and continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital.
Management believes that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means; however, we cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If the economic climate in the U.S. deteriorates, our ability to raise additional capital could be negatively impacted. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in our continued efforts to commercialize our products, which is critical to the realization of our business plan and our future operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Capital Expenditures
We currently forecast capital expenditures in order to execute on our business plan and maintain growth; however, the actual amount and timing of such capital expenditures will ultimately be determined by the volume of business. We currently do not anticipate that a material amount will be purchased for the year ended March 31, 2022. If we purchase capital equipment, we expect to pay cash for those expenditures or to finance them through equipment leases.
Material Trends and Uncertainties
On March 26, 2021, we entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with EMC Pharma, LLC, for the exclusive right to sell and distribute prescription dermatological and eye care products based on our Microcyn® technology in the United States. EMC has to purchase certain minimum product quantities and pay a quarterly royalty to retain the exclusive rights. The agreement has a five-year initial term, subject to mutual extension. EMC Pharma is a national healthcare industry products and service company specializing in the development of FDA-approved prescription products, distribution of pharmaceuticals, and specialty pharmacy services. EMC Pharma, LLC offers years of experience in product commercialization, trade relations, and supply chain management and has a broad network of industry partners in pharmaceutical manufacturing, pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution. As a result of this transaction, we reduced our sales force dedicated to direct sales of prescription dermatology products in the United States. Our direct sales model for our U.S. dermatology products has not been profitable since its inception and management expects that partnering with EMC will allow us to reduce significant overhead while working with EMC to build a profitable model to distribute our prescription products. The partnership also expands our distributor model which has built profitable sales for the company around the world.
For the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, sales to Invekra amounted to approximately 32% and 19% of our revenues, respectively. Our agreement with Invekra which obligated us to provide manufacturing for Invekra at reduced prices ended on October, 27, 2020. We processed product orders for Invekra through December 2020. We may continue to provide manufacturing support at prices commensurate with the market as backup manufacturer. As we make this transition, we expect our overall revenues from Invekra will decrease while our margins will increase. However, we expect that our future overall revenues from Latin American sales will be substantially reduced.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include reserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the recoverability of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and derivative instruments, debt discounts, valuation of investments and the estimated amortization periods of upfront product licensing fees received from customers.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
