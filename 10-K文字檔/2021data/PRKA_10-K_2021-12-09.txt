Overview
Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we own and operate three regional theme parks and are in the business of acquiring, developing and operating local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“Wild Animal - Georgia”), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (“Wild Animal - Missouri”), and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas”). Wild Animal - Georgia owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the “Georgia Park”). Wild Animal - Missouri owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the “Missouri Park”). Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas owns and operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari theme park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the “Texas Park”). On April 27, 2020, we acquired substantially all the assets of Aggieland Safari LLC and related entities (“Aggieland Safari”). For additional information see “NOTE 3. ACQUISITION” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on this matter.
Our Parks are open year round but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early September. As a result, our combined third and fourth quarter net sales have historically ranged from 68% to 72% of our annual attendance based net sales. For our 2021 fiscal year, the first full year including our Texas Park, combined third and fourth quarter net sales were approximately 60% of our annual attendance based net sales
The table below outlines our annual net sales, reported and adjusted income before income taxes, and net cash provided by operating activities for the last five fiscal years. During the past five fiscal years, our Georgia Park has benefitted from several positive factors including strong and stable management, the addition of online ticket sales in June 2015, growth and positive economic conditions in the greater Atlanta area, as well as positive guest perceptions of this Park. Our strong results through fiscal 2019 and the resulting improvements in our financial position provided us with the resources to pursue and ultimately complete the Aggieland Safari acquisition.
* - Excludes $189,988 gain on extinguishment of debt in 2021, $24,373 of tornado related insurance proceeds in 2020, $80,444 of tornado damage asset write-offs and costs in 2019, $130,532 of deferred financing costs write-offs in 2018, and a $80,000 settlement gain in 2017.
The rapid acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States occurred at the beginning of our 2020 fiscal year annual high season. We began to see a significant reduction in paid attendance at our Georgia and Missouri Parks beginning the week of March 9, 2020. Effective April 3, 2020, both Parks were closed as a result of shelter-in-place mandates in Georgia and Missouri. Also note that prior to our acquisition of our Texas Park, its operations were suspended for the majority of April 2020 due to a shelter-in-place mandate in Texas.
In compliance with respective state issued guidelines, our Georgia Park and our Texas Park each reopened on May 1, 2020, and our Missouri Park reopened on May 4, 2020. Attendance levels were strong at each of our three Parks for the balance of our 2020 fiscal year, which continued throughout our 2021 fiscal year, compared to pre-COVID 19 comparable periods. While attendance based net sales remained strong versus the comparable pre-COVID-19 period, we experienced a year-over-year decline in attendance based net sales and attendance during the final 22 weeks of our 2021 fiscal year versus the comparable period of our 2020 fiscal year. We believe the increased attendance levels each of our Parks has experienced since reopening in early May 2020 reflects the principally outdoor nature of the family-friendly, wild animal education and entertainment experience provided at each of our Parks. The experience offered at each of our Parks is particularly attractive during the COVID-19 pandemic as potential guests are seeking outdoor entertainment options. While we have seen many repeat customers since reopening in early May 2020, we also experienced an increase in first time visitors seeking an outdoor entertainment alternative. We believe this has increased the local and regional awareness for each of our Parks, which we believe will have positive longer-term ramifications for our business.
However, there remains the possibility of longer-term negative impacts to our business, results of operations and cash flows, and financial condition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative impacts may include changes in customer behavior and preferences causing significant volatility or reductions in attendance at one or more of our Parks, increases in operating expenses to comply with additional hygiene-related protocols, limitations in our ability to recruit and maintain staffing, limitations on our employees ability to work and travel, and significant changes in the economic or political conditions in the areas our Parks are located. Despite our efforts to manage these potential impacts, the ultimate impact may be material, and will depend on a number of factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the outbreak of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, and actions by governmental authorities taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. There is also the potential for attendance levels at our Parks to moderate or decline as alternative entertainment venues reopen to full capacity once the COVID-19 pandemic has run its course or vaccines are widely adopted and proven effective.
We are committed to leveraging the strong operating model we have established at our Georgia Park, with a focus on increasing attendance, as well as increasing the average revenue generated per guest visit via concession and gift shop revenues. Among our highest priorities over the next several years is continuing the integration of our Texas Park. As our Texas Park first opened to the public in May 2019, we believe there remains tremendous potential to increase attendance by increasing the local and regional awareness of this facility via advertising and promotion. We are pleased with the expanded attendance at our Missouri Park since it reopened in May 2020 and plan on leveraging the increased exposure of this facility to continue to build on this recent success.
During our 2021 fiscal year, we engaged an experienced amusement industry consulting firm to assist us in developing a master plan for our Georgia Park. Our 2022 fiscal year capital plan includes the first major project within that master plan, an impressive giraffe exhibit. This exhibit will be a new showcase for our Georgia Park, allowing our guests to encounter our giraffes regardless of weather conditions or outside temperatures. In aggregate, our 2022 fiscal year capital investment plan involves nearly $3.0 million of improvements across all three of our parks. This significant increase in capital investment spending will be fully funded from our existing cash, and demonstrates our commitment to building for long-term, sustainable growth.
Our long-term business plan includes expansion via the acquisition of additional local or regional theme parks and attractions, if attractive opportunities arise. We believe acquisitions, if any, should not unnecessarily encumber the Company with additional debt that cannot be justified by current operations. We may also pursue contract management opportunities for themed attractions owned by third parties. By using a combination of equity, debt and other financing options, we intend to carefully monitor stockholder value in conjunction with the pursuit of growth.
Strong growth in our annual operating cash flow over the past five to six fiscal years has provided us with incremental cash flow, and provided us with the financial strength to complete the Aggieland Safari acquisition. However, our current size and operating model leave us little room for error. Any future capital raised by us is likely to result in dilution to existing stockholders. It is possible that cash generated by, or available to, us may not be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the near-term.
Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations for the Year Ended October 3, 2021 as Compared to the Year Ended September 27, 2020
We manage our operations on an individual location basis. Discrete financial information is maintained for each Park and provided to our corporate management for review and as a basis for decision-making. The primary performance measures used to allocate resources are Park earnings before interest and tax expense, and free cash flow. We use this measure of operating profit to gauge segment performance because we believe this measure is the most indicative of performance trends and the overall earnings potential of each segment.
Our 2021 fiscal year was comprised of 53-weeks, compared to our 2020 fiscal year which was comprised of 52-weeks. Furthermore, our Texas Park was acquired on April 27, 2020, as such was included in our 2020 fiscal year reported results for a partial year. Therefore, in addition to full year reported attendance based sales comparisons, attendance based sales analyses will include comparable 53-week pro forma sales comparisons as if our Texas Park were acquired at the beginning of our 2020 fiscal year.
The following table shows our consolidated and segment operating results for the years ended October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020:
Total Net Sales
The Company’s total net sales for the year ended October 3, 2021 increased by $2.35 million or 24.8%, to $11.86 million compared to $9.51 million for the year ended September 27, 2020. Our Parks’ combined attendance based net sales increased by $2.21 million or 23.5%, and animal sales increased by $140,555. On a comparable 53-week pro forma basis, our attendance based net sales increased by $1.36 million or 13.3%.
On a reported basis, our Georgia Park’s attendance based net sales increased by $1.10 million or 16.2%, to $7.95 million, our Missouri Park’s attendance based net sales increased by $338,839 or 23.7%, to $1.77 million, and our Texas Park’s attendance based sales increased by $770,094 to $1.94 million.
On a comparable 53-week basis, our Georgia Park’s attendance based net sales increased by $973,189 or 14.0% and our Missouri Park’s attendance based net sales $313,720 or 21.6%. On a comparable 53-week pro forma basis, our Texas Park’s attendance based sales increased approximately $76,966 or 4.1%
On comparable 53-week basis, paid attendance at our Missouri Park increased by approximately 11.7%, while paid attendance at our Georgia Park declined by approximately 4.5%. On a comparable 53-week pro forma basis paid attendance at our Texas Park increased by approximately 3.2%.
Segment Operating Margin
Our consolidated segment operating margin increased $24,646, resulting in segment income from operations of $4.66 million for the year ended October 3, 2021 compared to segment income from operations of $4.63 million for the year ended September 27, 2020. Our Georgia Park’s segment income was $4.52 million, an increase of $403,723, principally as a result of higher attendance based net sales and higher animal sales, partially offset by higher cost of sales, as well as higher compensation and general operating expenses. Our Missouri Park generated a segment operating income of $202,597, an increase of $117,761. Excluding an insurance recovery of $24,373 for tornado damage during our 2020 fiscal year, our Missouri Park’s segment operating income increased by $142,134, primarily as a result of higher attendance based net sales, partially offset by higher cost of sales, and higher compensation and general operating expenses. Our Texas Park generated a segment loss of $62,922 for the year ended October 3, 2021, compared to segment income of $433,916 after its acquisition on April 27, 2020, resulting in a net decrease of $496,838. This decrease is primarily attributable higher cost of sales, higher compensation, advertising and general operating expenses, as well as higher depreciation expense, partially offset by higher attendance based net sales and higher animal sales.
Corporate Expenses
Corporate spending increased by $112,465 to $896,136 during the year ended October 3, 2021, primarily due to the hiring of an Executive Vice President of Operations and higher travel expenses, partially offset by lower professional fees.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net, was $65,314 for the year ended October 3, 2021, an increase of $37,526, primarily attributable to a full year of mineral rights royalty income for our Texas Park, partially offset by lower interest income.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
During the year ended October 3, 2021, we received notification the SBA approved both our Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan forgiveness applications, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $189,988.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended October 3, 2021 was $335,944, an increase of $153,018, primarily as a result of debt incurred related to the acquisition of our Texas Park on April 27, 2020, partially offset by a lower interest rate associated with the June 2021 refinancing of our Synovus Bank (“Synovus”) term loan.
Income Taxes
For the year ended October 3, 2021, we generated income before income taxes of $3.68 million and recorded a tax provision of $882,000, for an effective tax rate of approximately 24.0%, which was favorably impacted by the non-taxable PPP loan forgiveness. For the year ended September 27, 2020, we generated income before income taxes of $3.69 million and recorded a tax provision of $926,400, for an effective tax rate of approximately 25.1%.
For additional information, see “Note 8. Income Taxes” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Income and Income Per Share
Our reported net income for the year ended October 3, 2021 was $2.80 million or $0.04 per basic share and per fully diluted share, an increase of $31,077 as compared with reported net income of $2.77 million or $0.04 per basic share and per fully diluted share, for the year ended September 27, 2020.
As shown in the table above, several one-time items impacted our year-over-year reported net income comparison. Our 2021 fiscal year included a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $189,988. Our 2020 fiscal year included an insurance recovery of $24,373 associated with tornado damages at our Missouri Park. Management believes that adjusted net income, excluding one-time items, should be considered in evaluating the ongoing operating performance of our business. Excluding the after-tax effect of these items, our 2021 and 2020 fiscal year adjusted net income would have been $2.61 million and $2.75 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease in adjusted net income of $139,658. The decrease in our adjusted net income is attributable to a $496,838 decline in the segment income generated by our Texas Park, a $112,465 increase in Corporate expenses, and a $153,018 increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $403,723 increase in segment income for our Georgia Park, a $142,134 increase in the segment income of our Missouri Park, a $37,526 increase in other income and a $39,280 decrease in our income tax provision.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Financial Condition and Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Historically, our slow season starts after Labor Day in September and runs until Spring Break, which typically begins toward the end of March. The first and second quarters of our fiscal year have historically generated negative cash flow, requiring us to use cash generated from prior fiscal years, as well as borrowing on a seasonal basis, to fund operations and prepare our Parks for the busy season during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. As a result of our improved cash position, during our 2021 and 2020 fiscal years we did not utilize any seasonal borrowing.
On June 18, 2021, we entered a new $1.95 million, seven-year term loan (the “2021 Term Loan”) with Synovus Bank (“Synovus”), at an annual interest rate of 3.75%. The 2021 Term Loan replaced our 2018 borrowing facility with Synovus Bank, which included a term loan in the original principal amount of $1.60 million at 5.00% per annum and a $350,000 line of credit at 4.75% per annum. After paying off the balance outstanding on the 2018 Term Loan, the net additional borrowings on the 2021 Term Loan were $930,222 and the line of credit was not renewed. Combined with available cash, we used the incremental proceeds from the 2021 Term Loan to paydown $1.0 million of the 2020 Term Loan used to finance our Texas Park acquisition, which has a 5.00% annual interest rate. Overall, we estimate this refinancing will generate approximately $24,375 in annual interest savings.
Our working capital was $5.70 million as of October 3, 2021, compared to $3.86 million as of September 27, 2020. The year-over-year increase in working capital primarily reflects cash flow provided by operating activities, partially offset by capital investments, the payoff of the Aggieland Seller Note, as well as net term debt payments during our 2021 fiscal year.
Total loan debt, including current maturities, as of October 3, 2021 was $5.66 million compared to $7.02 million as of September 27, 2020. The year-over-year decrease in total loan debt is the result of the payoff of the Aggieland Seller Note, the forgiveness of our PPP loans and net term debt payments during our 2021 fiscal year. Our bank line of credit (“LOC”) was terminated effective June 18, 2021 and there were no borrowings on the LOC as of September 27, 2020.
As of October 3, 2021, we had equity of $14.57 million and total loan debt of $5.66 million, resulting in a debt to equity ratio of 0.39 to 1.0, compared to 0.60 to 1.0 as of September 27, 2020.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.31 million for our 2021 fiscal year, compared to $3.68 million, for our 2020 fiscal year, resulting in a decrease of $371,683, primarily due to working capital uses.
Investing Activities
Our 2021 fiscal year included $988,901 of capital improvements, compared to $525,409 spent on capital improvements during our 2020 fiscal year. In addition, during our 2020 fiscal year we acquired Aggieland Safari, investing approximately $6.37 million of cash.
During our 2021 fiscal year, property and equipment investing at our Georgia Park included improvements to our drive-through road and other infrastructure improvements, various improvements to our concession and food service capabilities, improvements and additions to animal shelters and exhibits, spending on annual requirements for our rental vehicle fleet, and the acquisition of various animals. For our Missouri Park, 2021 fiscal year property and equipment investments included improvements and additions to animal shelters and exhibits, the acquisition of various animals, fencing improvements, improvements to our gift shop, and the acquisition of various equipment. For our Texas Park, 2021 fiscal year property and equipment investments included improvements to animal shelters and exhibits, the acquisition of various park equipment, drive through road improvements, and the acquisition of various animals.
During our 2020 fiscal year, property and equipment investing at our Georgia Park included improvements to our drive-through roads, improvements and additions to animal shelters and exhibits, spending on annual requirements for our rental vehicle fleet, and various animal acquisitions. For our Missouri Park, 2020 fiscal year property and equipment investments included the completion of a new giraffe barn and primate night house, various animal acquisitions, fencing improvements and the acquisition of various equipment. For our Texas Park, 2020 fiscal year property and equipment investments included various park maintenance equipment and animal acquisitions.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $1.20 million for the year ended October 3, 2021, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $4.92 million for the year ended September 27, 2020.
In June 2021, we entered into the 2021 Term Loan for $1.95 million, using those proceeds to pay off the $1.02 million outstanding balance of our 2018 Term Loan. Combined with additional cash, we used the net remaining proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan to prepay $1.00 million against our 2020 Term Loan. In addition, on June 29, 2021, we paid off the $750,000 Aggieland Safari Seller Note.
Excluding the $1.0 million prepayment of the 2020 Term Loan, net principal payments against our combined term loans totaled $448,648 for the year ended October 3, 2021.
During the year ended September 27, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities related to our Aggieland acquisition totaled $4.94 million, cash provided by PPP loans totaled $188,087 was provided by PPP loans, while cash used for scheduled payments against our 2018 Term Loan totaled $207,135.
Borrowing Agreements
On June 18, 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary Wild Animal - Georgia, we completed a refinancing transaction (the “2021 Refinancing”) with Synovus Bank (“Synovus”). The 2021 Refinancing included a term loan in the original principal amount of $1.95 million (the “2021 Term Loan”). The 2021 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 3.75% per annum and is payable in monthly installments of approximately $26,480, based on a seven-year amortization period. The 2021 Term Loan has a maturity date of June 18, 2028. The 2021 Term Loan is secured by a security deed on the assets of Wild Animal - Georgia. We paid a total of approximately $1,514 in fees and expenses in connection with the 2021 Refinancing. The outstanding balance of the 2021 Term Loan was $1.89 million as of October 3, 2021.
On April 27, 2020, we acquired Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas, financing the transaction with the 2020 Term Loan from First Financial Bank (“First Financial”) and the Aggieland Seller Note. The 2020 Term Loan in the original principal amount of $5.0 million from First Financial is secured by substantially all the Aggieland Wild Animal - Texas assets, as well as guarantees from the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2020 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum, has a maturity date of April 27, 2031, and required interest only monthly payments through April 2021. The 2020 Term Loan requires monthly payments of approximately $53,213 beginning in May 2021. We paid a total of approximately $62,375 in fees and expenses in connection with the 2020 Term Loan. On June 30, 2021, the Company used the incremental proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan, combined with additional funds, to paydown $1.0 million against the 2020 Term Loan, which had an outstanding balance of $3.83 million as of October 3, 2021.
The Aggieland Seller Note represented a deferred portion of the purchase price, had a face value of $750,000, bore no interest, had a maturity date of June 30, 2021, and was secured by a second priority subordinated lien and security interest in the acquired mineral rights and the animal inventory. We applied a 2.5% discount rate to determine a fair value of $728,500 for the Aggieland Seller Note as of April 27, 2020 and the resulting $21,500 discount was amortized as interest expense over the 14 month period of the note. On June 29, 2021, the Company paid off the Aggieland Seller Note.
On July 11, 2018, through our wholly owned subsidiary Wild Animal - Georgia, we completed a refinancing transaction (the “2018 Refinancing”) with Synovus. The 2018 Refinancing included a term loan in the original principal amount of $1.6 million (the “2018 Term Loan”). The 2018 Term Loan had an interest rate of 5.0% per annum and was payable in monthly payments of approximately $22,672, based on a seven-year amortization period. The 2018 Term Loan had a maturity date of June 11, 2021, with an option to renew at 5.0% per annum for an additional 49-month term. The 2018 Term Loan was secured by a security deed on the assets of Wild Animal - Georgia. We paid a total of approximately $15,680 in fees and expenses in connection with the 2018 Refinancing. The 2021 Term Loan replaced our 2018 Term Loan with Synovus, which had an outstanding balance of $1.02 million, and was paid off with the proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan.
As a result of the significant negative economic impacts and uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri each applied for PPP loans. On April 14, 2020 and April 16, 2020, we received two unsecured PPP loans totaling $188,087. The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The term of the PPP loans was two years, with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum. All payments were deferred for the first twelve months of these PPP loans, with accrued interest being added to the principal during the payment deferral period. Under the terms of the CARES Act, some or all the PPP loan proceeds were eligible to be forgiven, based on use for specified purposes, subject to limitations and ongoing rulemaking by the SBA. We applied for forgiveness of the full amount of both the Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri PPP loans in March 2021. Effective March 29, 2021 and May 25, 2021, the SBA approved the Forgiveness Applications for Wild Animal - Georgia and Wild Animal - Missouri, respectively, including forgiveness of accrued interest, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $189,988 during the year ended October 3, 2021.
Subsequent Events
None
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are set forth in “NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTNG POLICIES” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial position. Our critical accounting policies are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, revenue recognition, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, our results of operations or financial condition could differ, perhaps materially, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Long-lived Assets, including Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided on the straight-line method and is based on the estimated useful economic lives of the respective assets. We make subjective assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record annually with respect to our investments in property and equipment. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income or loss, as a change in the estimated useful economic lives of our investments in property and equipment would increase or decrease depreciation expense, thereby decreasing or increasing net income or loss. We review long-lived assets whenever circumstances change such that the recorded value of an asset may not be recoverable and therefore impaired.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenues when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring control of promised services or products to our guests/customers in an amount that reflects the amount the Company has received or expects to receive in exchange for those services or products. Park admission fee revenues from advance online ticket purchases are deferred until the customers’ visit to the parks. Park admission revenues for annual passes and memberships are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis over the term of the pass or membership. Revenues from retail and concession sales are generally recognized upon the concurrent receipt of payment and delivery of goods to the customer. Sales taxes billed and collected are not included in revenue.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement amounts and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We review our deferred tax assets to determine whether their value can be realized based upon available evidence. A valuation allowance is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Significant judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We record deferred tax assets, primarily resulting from net operating loss carry-forwards, to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we determine it is more likely than not we will not realize our deferred tax assets we establish a valuation allowance.
Contingencies
We have various contingencies, as described in “NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are not aware of any other legal matters involving the Company, however, there can be no assurance that all proceedings that may currently be brought against us are known by us at this time.
