Introduction
We are a commercial real estate finance company externally managed by TPG RE Finance Trust Management, L.P. and sponsored by TPG. We directly originate, acquire and manage commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments in North America for our balance sheet. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over time through cash distributions and capital appreciation. To meet our objective, we focus primarily on directly originating and selectively acquiring floating rate first mortgage loans that are secured by high quality commercial real estate properties undergoing some form of transition and value creation, such as retenanting, refurbishment or other form of repositioning. The collateral underlying our loans is located in primary and select secondary markets in the U.S. that we believe have attractive economic conditions and commercial real estate fundamentals. We operate our business as one segment.
As of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio consisted of 56 first mortgage loans (or interests therein) and one mezzanine loan with total loan commitments of $4.9 billion, an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $4.5 billion, a weighted average credit spread of 3.2%, a weighted average all-in yield of 5.3%, a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming all extension options have been exercised by borrowers) of 3.1 years, and a weighted average LTV of 65.9%. As of December 31, 2020, 100% of the loan commitments in our portfolio consisted of floating rate loans, of which 99.3% were first mortgage loans or, in one instance a first mortgage loan and contiguous mezzanine loan both owned by us, and 0.7% was a mezzanine loan. As of December 31, 2020, we had $423.5 million of unfunded loan commitments, our funding of which is subject to borrower satisfaction of certain milestones.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $99.2 million of real estate owned comprising 27 acres across two undeveloped commercially-zoned land parcels on the Las Vegas Strip (the “Property”) acquired pursuant to a negotiated deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. This Property is held for investment and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets at its estimate of fair value at the time of acquisition.
We have made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and we believe that our organization and current and intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic caused significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economies. These disruptions contributed to significant and ongoing volatility, widening credit spreads and sharp declines in liquidity in the real estate securities and whole loan financing markets at points during 2020. The pace of recovery following this disruption remains uncertain, as do the longer-term economic effects and shifts in behavior. As a result of the impact of COVID-19, many commercial real estate finance and financial services industry participants, including us, reduced new investment activity until the capital markets became more stable, the macroeconomic outlook became clearer, market liquidity improved, and transaction volumes increased. For most of 2020, we focused on actively managing portfolio credit, generating and recycling liquidity from existing assets, extending the maturities and further reducing the mark-to-market exposure of our
liabilities and controlling corporate overhead as a percentage of our total assets and total revenues. Although market conditions remain uncertain due to COVID-19 and the slow rate of vaccination, the credit performance of our portfolio, loan repayments that have allowed us to retire certain borrowings and increase our liquidity, extended maturity dates for many of our secured credit agreements, and the introduction of a new secured credit agreement limiting mark-to-market risk relating to hotel loans in our portfolio, have positioned us to resume the origination of first mortgage transitional loans. For more information regarding the impact that COVID-19 has had and may have on our business in the future, see “Risk Factors.”

Financing Capacity at December 31, 2020 was comprised of:
•
$3.2 billion of loan financing capacity under secured credit agreements provided by seven lenders. Our ability to draw on this capacity is dependent upon our lenders’ willingness to accept as collateral loan investments we pledge to them to secure additional borrowings. These financing arrangements have credit spreads based upon the LTV and other risk characteristics of collateral pledged, and provide stable financing with mark-to-market provisions generally limited to collateral-specific events and, in only one instance, to capital markets-specific events. As of December 31, 2020, borrowings under these financing arrangements had a weighted average credit spread of 2.16% and a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming we have exercised all extension options and term-out provisions) of 2.6 years. These financing arrangements are generally 25% recourse to Holdco.
Key Financial Measures and Indicators
As a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared per common share, Distributable Earnings, and book value per share. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded diluted earnings per common share of $0.09, declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, and a special cash dividend of $0.18 per common share attributable to our estimated 2020 REIT taxable income which was previously undistributed, and reported $0.15 per share of Distributable Earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded diluted loss per common share of $2.03, declared cash dividends of $1.21 per common share, and reported Distributable Earnings per share of $(1.39). In addition, our book value per common share as of December 31, 2020 was $16.50. As further described below, Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use Distributable Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations.
Earnings(loss) Per Common Share and Dividends Declared Per Common Share
The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of participating securities outstanding plus the incremental shares that would be outstanding assuming exercise of warrants, which may be exercised on a net-settlement basis. The number of incremental shares is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. We exclude participating securities and warrants from the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share in periods of net losses since their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we present diluted earnings per share because the average market price of our common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2020 was $9.47, which exceeds the strike price of $7.50 per common share for warrants currently outstanding.
The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):
(1)
Represents net income (loss) attributable to holders of our common stock and Class A common stock after deducting Series A and Series B Preferred Stock dividends.
(2)
Weighted average number of common shares outstanding, earnings per common share and dividends declared per common share includes common stock and Class A common stock. All then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock were converted to common stock on February 14, 2020.
(3)
Includes a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, and a special cash dividend of $0.18 per common share attributable to our estimated 2020 REIT taxable income which was previously undistributed.
Distributable Earnings
We use Distributable Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations. Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) unrealized gains (losses), and (iv) certain non-cash items. Distributable Earnings may also be adjusted from time to time to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager, subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Distributable Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. Distributable Earnings is substantially the same as Core Earnings, as defined in our Management Agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information for our investors to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income. Dividends are one of the principal reasons investors invest our common stock and over time Distributable Earnings has been a useful indicator of our dividends per share. As such, Distributable Earnings is a measure considered by us in determining dividends.
In assessing the impact of the new credit loss accounting guidance on our Distributable Earnings, we determined that, consistent with our policy on credit loss measurement and our stakeholders’ view of realized loan losses, the credit loss provision or reversal as computed under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, should be included within unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items as referenced above, but only to the extent that it exceeds any realized credit losses during the period. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details related to our accounting policy on credit loss measurement. Consistent with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, a loan will be charged off as a realized loss when it is deemed non-recoverable upon a realization event. This is generally at the time the loan
receivable is settled, transferred or exchanged, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying property is sold, but non-recoverability may also be concluded by us if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The realized loss shall equal the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the book value of the asset. This policy is reflective of our economics as it relates to the ultimate realization of the loan.
Distributable Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings reported by other companies.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to Distributable Earnings (in thousands, except share and per share data):
(1)
Represents GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our common and Class A common stockholders after deducting dividends attributable to participating securities. For more information regarding the calculation of earnings per share using the two-class method, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
(2)
Credit Loss Expense excludes a realized loss of $13.8 million on the sale of one loan for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and a realized loss of $12.8 million on an extinguishment of a first mortgage loan that experienced a maturity default for the three and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, both included in Credit Loss Expense on our consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). See Notes 3 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details.
(3)
Weighted average number of shares outstanding includes common stock and Class A common stock.
Book Value Per Common Share
The following table sets forth the calculation of our book value per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):

Portfolio Overview
Our investment portfolio includes our portfolio of floating rate mortgage loans and real estate owned. At December 31, 2020, our balance sheet loan portfolio was comprised of 57 loans totaling $4.9 billion of commitments with an unpaid principal balance of $4.5 billion, as compared to 65 loans with $5.6 billion of commitments and an unpaid principal balance $5.0 billion at December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, we owned real estate with a carrying value of $99.2 million comprising 27 acres across two undeveloped commercially-zoned land parcels on the Las Vegas Strip acquired pursuant to a negotiated deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. This Property is held for investment and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets at its estimate of fair value at the time of acquisition.
Loan Portfolio
During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we did not originate any loans. Loan fundings included $62.5 million of deferred fundings related to previously originated loan commitments. Proceeds from loan repayments during the three months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $365.1 million. Loan extinguishment represents extinguishment of a $112.0 million first mortgage loan by its conversion to real estate owned through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. We generated interest income of $62.0 million and incurred interest expense of $21.5 million, which resulted in net interest income of $40.5 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we originated six loans with a total loan commitment amount of $526.3 million, of which $431.9 million was funded at origination. These originations include one mortgage loan, with an initial unpaid principal balance of $78.4 million, which involved the assumption and simultaneous assignment of an existing first mortgage loan by the third-party purchaser of the property securing the loan. This amendment is not considered a TDR under GAAP. The transaction was treated under GAAP as a new loan origination and extinguishment of the then-existing loan. Other loan fundings included $237.9 million of deferred fundings related to previously originated loan commitments. Proceeds from loan repayments totaled $885.6 million due primarily to the repayment in full of 13 loans totaling $852.8 million of unpaid principal balance. Loan extinguishment represents extinguishment of a $112.0 million first mortgage loan by its conversion to real estate owned through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $145.7 million. We generated interest income of $283.7 million and incurred interest expense of $107.2 million, which resulted in net interest income of $176.4 million. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details.
The following table details our loan activity by unpaid principal balance for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2020 include an assumption and simultaneous assignment of an existing first mortgage loan with an unpaid principal balance of $78.4 million by the third-party purchaser of the property securing the loan. The transaction was treated as a new loan origination and extinguishment of the existing loan under GAAP.
(2)
Additional fundings made under existing loan commitments.
(3)
Loan sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 includes the sale, at no gain or loss, of a $46.4 million mezzanine loan (with a commitment amount of $50.0 million) related to a contiguous first mortgage loan secured by the same property with an unpaid principal balance of $279.2 million and a commitment amount of $300.8 million at the time of sale, and the sale of one loan with an unpaid principal balance of $99.3 million for $85.5 million resulting in a realized loss of $13.8 million.
(4)
Includes extinguishment of a first mortgage loan with an unpaid principal balance of $112.0 million as of December 31, 2020. On December 31, 2020, we took title to the Property pursuant to a negotiated deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Fair value of the Property at the time of acquisition was $99.2 million resulting in a realized loss of $12.8 million, equal to the
previously recorded CECL reserve included in our results of operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020. See Notes 3 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details.
The following table provides selected statistics for our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
In certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third-party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our balance sheet. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third-party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan. Total loan commitment encompasses the entire loan portfolio we originated, acquired and financed. At December 31, 2020, we had one non-consolidated senior interest outstanding of $132.0 million.
(2)
Unpaid principal balance includes PIK interest of $4.7 million as of December 31, 2020.
(3)
Unfunded loan commitments may be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date or a force-funding date, primarily to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by our borrowers, to finance operating deficits during renovation and lease-up, and in limited instances to finance construction.
(4)
As of December 31, 2020, our floating rate loans were indexed to LIBOR. In addition to credit spread, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, purchase price premium and discount, loan origination costs and accrual of both extension and exit fees. Credit spread and all-in yield for the total portfolio assumes the applicable floating benchmark rate, inclusive of LIBOR floors, as of December 31, 2020 for weighted average calculations.
(5)
Extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2020, based on the unpaid principal balance of our total loan exposure, 31.7% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 68.3% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty.
(6)
Except for construction loans, LTV is calculated for loan originations and existing loans as the total outstanding principal balance of the loan or participation interest in a loan (plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan or participation interest) as of December 31, 2020, divided by the as-is appraised value of our collateral at the time of origination or acquisition of such loan or participation interest. For construction loans only, LTV is calculated as the total commitment amount of the loan divided by the as-stabilized value of the real estate securing the loan. The as-is or as-stabilized (as applicable) value reflects our Manager’s estimates, at the time of origination or acquisition of the loan or participation interest in a loan, of the real estate value underlying such loan or participation interest determined in accordance with our Manager’s underwriting standards and consistent with third-party appraisals obtained by our Manager.
Real Estate Owned
In December 2020, we acquired two undeveloped commercially-zoned land parcels on the Las Vegas Strip comprising 27 acres (the “Property”) pursuant to a negotiated deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. This Property previously served as collateral for a first mortgage loan receivable held for investment with an unpaid principal balance of $112.0 million, an independently-assessed credit loss reserve of $12.8 million as of September 30, 2020, and net carrying value of $99.2 million. On October 9, 2020, the first mortgage loan reached final maturity without repayment or satisfaction of extension conditions, which triggered a maturity default. On December 31, 2020, we took ownership of the Property, extinguished the first mortgage loan receivable, and realized a loss of $12.8 million, equal to the previously recorded specific CECL reserve on the first mortgage loan. At December 31, 2020, this Property is considered held for investment and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value,
net of estimated selling costs, of $99.2 million. Our estimate of the Property’s fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow model and Level 3 inputs, which include estimates of parcel-specific cash flows over a specific holding period, at a discount rate that ranges between 8.0% - 17.5% based on the risk profile of estimated cash flows associated with each respective parcel, and estimated capitalization rate of 6.25%, where applicable. These inputs are based on the highest and best use for each parcel, estimated future values for the parcels based on extensive discussions with local brokers, investors and other market participants, the estimated holding period for the parcels, and discount rates that reflect estimated investor return requirements for the risks associated with the expected use of each sub-parcel. We obtained from a third party a $50.0 million first mortgage loan secured by the Property, which is classified as Mortgage Loan Payable on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details of the Mortgage Loan Payable.
CRE Debt Securities
We have invested and may invest in the future in CRE debt securities investments as part of our investment strategy. As of December 31, 2020, we did not own any CRE debt securities. Refer to Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details on CRE debt securities.
Asset Management
We actively manage the assets in our portfolio from closing to final repayment. We are party to an agreement with SitusAMC, one of the largest commercial mortgage loan servicers, pursuant to which SitusAMC provides us with dedicated asset management employees for performing asset management services pursuant to our proprietary guidelines. Following the closing of an investment, this dedicated asset management team rigorously monitors the investment under our Manager’s oversight, with an emphasis on ongoing financial, legal and quantitative analyses. Through the final repayment of an investment, the asset management team maintains regular contact with borrowers, servicers and local market experts monitoring performance of the collateral, anticipating borrower, property and market issues, and enforcing our rights and remedies when appropriate.
Our Manager reviews our entire loan portfolio quarterly, undertakes an assessment of the performance of each loan, and assigns it a risk rating between “1” and “5,” from least risk to greatest risk, respectively. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion regarding the risk rating system that we use in connection with our portfolio. The following table allocates the amortized cost of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 based on our internal risk ratings (dollars in thousands):
For the period ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the weighted average risk rating of our total loan exposure based on amortized cost was 3.1 and 2.9, respectively. The increase in the risk rating was primarily the result of hospitality loans that were downgraded to a “4” during the first quarter of 2020, which are properties particularly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, or to a “5” due to default. For changes in risk ratings during each of the four quarters of 2020, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Our initial CECL reserve of $19.6 million due to the application of the CECL methodology in the first quarter of 2020 (as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K) over performing loans on which we had previously not carried an allowance for credit losses is reflected as a direct charge to retained earnings on our Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an increase of $43.2 million in the allowance for credit losses, including realized losses of $12.8 million on the extinguishment of a loan and its conversion to real estate owned, and $13.8 million on the sale of a loan, bringing the total CECL reserve to $62.8 million as of December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our estimate of expected credit losses increased due to recessionary macroeconomic assumptions employed in determining our model-based CECL reserve, and an increase due to an independently-assessed loan in the fourth quarter of 2020, offset by a decline in total loan commitments and unpaid principal balance due to loan repayments and sales. Additionally, the average risk ratings of our loans increased from 2.9 as of December 31, 2019 to 3.1 as of December 31, 2020, as described above. The impact of reduced economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused reduced activity in certain sectors of the capital markets, which may slow the pace of loan repayments, and will likely impact commercial property values and valuation inputs. While the ultimate impact is uncertain, we have made certain forward-looking adjustments to the inputs of our calculation of the allowance for credit losses to reflect uncertain economic expectations.
We placed one loan secured by a retail property on non-accrual status due to a borrower default in December 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the borrower made the interest payment from funds available, however, we elected to place the loan on non-accrual status from December 2020, in accordance with our non-accrual policy. The amortized cost of the loan was $31.1 million and $30.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. On December 31, 2020, we determined that this first mortgage loan met the CECL framework’s criteria for individual assessment. Accordingly, we utilized the estimated fair value of the collateral on December 31, 2020 to estimate a loan loss reserve of $10.0 million as of that date, which is included in the CECL reserve. As of December 31, 2020, this loan was current with respect to scheduled payments. There were no loans on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2019.
We expect that over the near, intermediate, and perhaps long term, the economic and market disruptions caused by COVID-19 will adversely impact or continue to adversely impact the financial condition of some of our borrowers. There is no assurance that the number of borrowers who become delinquent or default on their loans will not increase. We have entered into loan modification agreements with several borrowers that permit borrowers to defer payment of some or all of the interest on their loans generally for a period of up to six months, and/or the repurposing of certain cash reserve balances within the loan structure for use in paying interest or operating expenses. In exchange, borrowers and sponsors are required to make partial principal repayments and/or provide us additional cash for payment of interest, operating expenses, and replenishment of capital reserves in amounts and combinations acceptable to us. In addition, certain of our borrowers have not and may not meet required conditions to extend the maturities of their loans and may require accommodations to provide additional time for property operations to recover in order to facilitate a refinance of their loans or a sale of the property.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we executed 17 loan modifications with borrowers which includes short-term modifications such as payment deferrals, fee and extension test waivers and extensions of repayment terms. Eleven loan modifications expired during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, with one renewed on revised terms in the fourth quarter of 2020. The aggregate unpaid principal balance for all loans modified during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, excluding three loans that were repaid, was $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2020, six modifications are outstanding with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $548.4 million. Total PIK interest of $0.8 million and $4.7 million was deferred and added to the outstanding loan principal during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively. None of the loan modifications executed during the year trigger the requirements for accounting as TDRs. Eight of the modifications met the safe-harbor conditions of the “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus” issued by banking regulators in consultation with FASB. All of the modified loans during the year and outstanding as of December 31, 2020, are performing, except for one which is on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for details of these modifications.
We continue to work with our borrowers to address the challenging circumstances caused by COVID-19 while protecting the credit attributes of our loans. However, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful, and we may experience payment delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, or losses.
Investment Portfolio Financing
Our portfolio financing arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 included collateralized loan obligations, secured credit agreements, a mortgage loan payable (only as of December 31, 2020), and an asset-specific financing arrangement (only as of December 31, 2019). We had one outstanding non-consolidated senior interest at December 31, 2020 and 2019, with a total loan commitment of $132.0 million.
The following table details our portfolio financing arrangements at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Increase in the balance as of December 31, 2020 is due to the sale of TRTX 2018-FL2 Notes during the second quarter of 2020 with an aggregate note face amount of $14.7 million, previously acquired in the open market.
(2)
Excludes deferred financing costs of $18.9 million and $25.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Non-mark-to-market financing sources accounted for 63.5% of our total loan portfolio financing arrangements at December 31, 2020. The remaining 36.5% of our loan portfolio financing arrangements, which are comprised primarily of our secured credit facilities, are subject only to credit and spread marks. The following table summarizes our loan portfolio financing as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
On February 16, 2021, we extended our existing secured credit facility with Morgan Stanley to a new initial maturity date of May 4, 2022.
Secured Credit Facilities
As of December 31, 2020, aggregate borrowings outstanding under our secured credit facilities totaled $1.5 billion, which was entirely related to our mortgage loan investments. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.16% per annum, and the weighted average advance rate was 69.3%. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding borrowings under these facilities for our mortgage loan investments had a weighted average term to extended maturity of 2.6 years (assuming we exercise all extension options and term out provisions available to us). These secured credit agreements are 25% recourse to Holdco.
On October 30, 2020, we closed, with a single institutional counterparty, a secured credit facility with a commitment amount and unpaid principal balance of $249.5 million. The credit facility is secured by seven first mortgage loans, or participation interests therein. The new credit facility has a committed term of three years through October 30, 2023, a credit spread of 4.50%, a LIBOR floor of 0.25%, and contains no mark-to-market provisions that would trigger margin calls for two years from closing.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we:
•
exercised an existing option to extend our Goldman Sachs Bank USA secured credit facility through August 19, 2021, reduced the commitment amount from $750.0 million to $250.0 million, and obtained an accordion option to increase the commitment amount up to $500.0 million.
•
exercised an existing option to extend through May 4, 2021 our secured credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.
•
extended the maturity date of our Bank of America secured credit facility to September 29, 2021, reduced the commitment amount from $500.0 million to $200.0 million, and retained an accordion option to increase the total commitment up to $500.0 million.
•
extended our existing secured credit facility with JP Morgan Chase to a new initial maturity date of October 30, 2023.
The following tables detail our secured credit facilities as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Commitment amount represents the largest amount of borrowings available under a given agreement once sufficient collateral assets have been approved by the lender and pledged by us.
(2)
Represents the commitment amount less the approved borrowings which amount is available to be borrowed provided we pledge and the lender approves additional collateral assets.
(3)
Undrawn capacity represents the positive difference between the borrowing amount approved by the lender against collateral assets pledged by us and the amount actually drawn against those collateral assets.
(4)
Our ability to extend our secured credit facilities to the dates shown above is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Even if extended, our lenders retain sole discretion to determine whether to accept pledged collateral, and the advance rate and credit spread applicable to each borrowing thereunder.
The maximum and average month end balances for our secured credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
(1)
The maximum month end balance subtotal and total represents the maximum outstanding borrowings on all secured credit facilities at a month end during the year ended December 31, 2020.
(2)
None of these secured credit facilities had balances outstanding after April 30, 2020, and all such facilities were terminated prior to June 30, 2020.
We separate our secured credit facilities into two categories: secured credit facilities secured by our loan assets; and secured credit facilities secured by our CRE debt securities. At December 31, 2020, we no longer had any secured credit facilities secured by CRE debt securities.
Once we identify an asset and the asset is approved by the secured credit facility lender to serve as collateral (which lender’s approval is in its sole discretion), we and the lender may enter into a transaction whereby the lender advances to us a percentage of the value of the asset, which is referred to as the “advance rate.” In the case of borrowings under our repurchase facilities, this advance serves as the purchase price at which the lender acquires the loan asset from us with an obligation of ours to repurchase the asset from the lender for an amount equal to the purchase price for the transaction plus a price differential, which is calculated based on an interest rate. Advance rates are subject to negotiation between us and our secured credit facility lenders. In connection only with our former secured credit facilities secured by CRE debt securities, advance rates could be reduced or increased upon the maturity of the applicable contract.
For each transaction, we and the lender agree to a trade confirmation which sets forth, among other things, the purchase price if a repurchase facility, the maximum advance rate, the interest rate and the market value of the asset. For transactions under our secured credit agreements secured by our loan assets, the trade confirmation may also set forth any future funding obligations which are contemplated with respect to the specific transaction and/or the underlying loan asset. For loan assets which involve future funding obligations of ours, the transaction may provide for the lender to fund portions (for example, pro rata per the maximum advance rate of the related transaction) of such future funding obligations. The trade confirmation can also set forth loan-specific margin maintenance provisions, described below.
Generally, our secured credit facilities allow for revolving balances, which allow us to voluntarily repay balances and draw again on existing available credit. The primary obligor on each secured credit facility is a separate special purpose subsidiary of ours which is restricted from conducting activity other than activity related to the utilization of its secured credit facility and the loans or loan interests that are originated or acquired by such subsidiary. As additional credit support, our holding company subsidiary, Holdco, provides certain guarantees of the obligations of its subsidiaries. The amount of Holdco’s potential liability under these guarantees depends upon whether the guarantee relates to a secured credit facility secured by loans or by CRE debt securities:
•
For our secured credit facilities secured by loans, Holdco’s liability is generally capped at 25% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which is the primary obligor under the related agreement. However, this liability cap does not apply in the event of certain “bad boy” defaults which can trigger recourse to Holdco for losses or the entire outstanding obligations of the borrower depending on the nature of the “bad boy” default in question. Examples of such “bad boy” defaults include, without limitation, fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct, incurrence of additional debt in violation of financing documents, and the filing of a voluntary or collusive involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the special purpose entity subsidiary or the guarantor entity.
•
For our former secured credit facilities secured by CRE debt securities, Holdco’s liability was in an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding obligations of the special purpose subsidiary which was the primary obligor under the related agreement.
Each of the secured credit facilities have “margin maintenance” provisions, which are designed to allow the lender to maintain a certain margin of credit enhancement and/or against the assets which serve as collateral. The lender’s margin amount is typically based on a percentage of the market value of the asset and/or mortgaged property collateral; however, certain secured credit agreements may also involve margin maintenance based on maintenance of a minimum debt yield with respect to the cash flow from the underlying real estate collateral. In certain cases, margin maintenance provisions can relate to minimum debt yields for pledged collateral considered as a whole, or limits on concentration of loan exposure measured by property type or loan type.
The margin maintenance provisions differ in some respects, depending upon whether the provisions are contained in secured credit facilities secured by loans or by CRE debt securities:
•
Our secured credit facilities secured by loans contain defined mark-to-market provisions that permit the lenders to issue margin calls to us in the event that the collateral properties underlying our loans pledged to our lenders experience a non-temporary decline in value or net cash flow (“credit marks”) due to reasons other than capital markets events that result in changing credit spreads for similar borrowing
obligations. In connection with one of these borrowing arrangements, the lender is also permitted to issue margin calls to the Company in the event the lender determines capital markets events have caused credit spreads to change for similar borrowing obligations (“spread marks”). Furthermore, in connection with one of these borrowing arrangements, the lender has the right to re-margin the secured credit facility based solely on appraised loan-to-values in the third year of the facility. On May 28, 2020, we made voluntary deleveraging payments totaling $157.7 million to our seven secured credit facility lenders in exchange for their agreement to suspend margin calls for defined periods, subject to certain conditions. When these payments were made, no margin deficits existed, and no margin calls have been issued to us since. The margin holiday agreements expired in December 2020. If market turbulence returns, we may be exposed to margin calls in connection with our secured credit agreements secured by our mortgage loan investments.
•
Our secured credit facilities secured by CRE debt securities contained daily mark-to-market provisions that permitted the lenders to issue margin calls to us in response to changing interest rates and credit spreads on the CRE debt securities so financed. As a result, during the six months ended June 30, 2020, extreme short-term volatility and negative pressure in the financial markets required us to post cash collateral with our lenders under these facilities. See the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for more information.
The maturity dates for each of our secured credit agreements are set forth in tables that appear earlier in this section. Our secured credit agreements secured by loans generally have terms of between one and three years, but may be extended if we satisfy certain performance-based conditions. Our secured credit facilities secured by CRE debt securities generally had terms between one month and three months, and the lenders under these agreements generally had the right not to renew, or to do so only on a shorter term. In the normal course of business, we maintain discussions with our lenders to extend or amend any financing facilities related to our loans which contain near-term expirations.
At December 31, 2020, the weighted average haircut (which is equal to one minus the advance rate percentage against collateral for our secured credit facilities taken as a whole) was 30.7% as compared to 19.4% at December 31, 2019. The year-over-year increase in our weighted average haircut was due primarily to two factors: first, the repayment in full and subsequent termination by us of all of our secured credit agreements for CRE debt securities: and, second, our voluntary deleveraging repayments of $157.7 million made on May 28, 2020. The haircut for our secured credit agreements is dependent on the collateral used (loans or CRE debt securities) for the secured credit agreements. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the following table presents the weighted average haircut on our secured credit agreements by collateral type:
The secured credit facilities also include cash management features which generally require that income from collateral loan assets be deposited in a lender-controlled account and be distributed in accordance with a specified waterfall of payments designed to keep facility-related obligations current before such income is disbursed for our own account. The cash management features generally require the trapping of cash in such controlled account if an uncured default remains outstanding. Furthermore, some secured credit agreements may require an accelerated principal amortization schedule if the secured credit agreement is in its final extended term.
Notwithstanding that a loan asset may be subject to a financing arrangement and serve as collateral under a secured credit facility, we retain the right to administer and service the loan and interact directly with the underlying obligors and sponsors of our loan assets so long as there is no default under the secured credit agreement and so long as we do not engage in certain material modifications (including amendments, waivers, exercises of remedies, or releases of obligors and collateral, among other things) of the loan assets without the lender’s prior consent.
Collateralized Loan Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, we had two collateralized loan obligations, TRTX 2019-FL3 and TRTX 2018-FL2, totaling $1.8 billion, financing 31 existing first mortgage loan investments totaling $2.2 billion, providing efficient cost, non-mark-to-market, non-recourse financing for 52.6% of our loan portfolio borrowings. The collateralized loan obligations bear a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.4%, have a weighted average advance rate of 82.3%, and include a reinvestment feature that allows us to contribute existing or newly originated loan investments in exchange for proceeds from loan repayments held in the collateralized loan obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we reinvested $618.8 million of cash in TRTX 2018-FL2 and TRTX 2019-FL3 generated by loan payments. The reinvestment period for TRTX 2018-FL2 ended on December 11, 2020, and the reinvestment period for TRTX 2019-FL3 will end on October 11, 2021.
Mortgage Loan Payable
We are, through a special purpose entity, a borrower under a $50.0 million mortgage loan secured by a first deed of trust against two undeveloped commercially-zoned land parcels on the Las Vegas Strip comprising 27 acres (the “Property”) pursuant to a negotiated deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information. The first mortgage loan was provided by an institutional lender, has an initial maturity date of December 15, 2021, and an option to extend the maturity for 12 months subject to the satisfaction of customary extension conditions, including (i) the purchase of a new interest rate cap for the extension term, (ii) replenishment of the interest reserve with an amount equal to 12 months of debt service, (iii) payment of a 0.25% extension fee on the outstanding principal balance, and (iv) no event of default. The first mortgage loan permits partial releases of collateral in exchange for payment of a minimum release price equal to the greater of 100% of net sales proceeds (after reasonable transaction expenses) or 115% of the allocated loan amount. The loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.50% subject to a LIBOR interest rate floor and cap of 0.50%. We have posted cash of $2.4 million to pre-fund interest payments due under the note during its initial term.
Secured Revolving Credit Agreement
Previously, we were a party to a secured revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A. with maximum borrowing capacity of $160.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability and certain other conditions. We used this facility to finance originations or acquisitions of eligible loans on an interim basis until permanent financing was arranged. The facility had an initial maturity date of July 12, 2020 and an interest rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR or the applicable base rate plus a margin of 2.25%. The initial advance rate on borrowings under the secured revolving credit agreement with respect to individual pledged assets could range up to 70% and decline thereafter during the maximum borrowing term of 90 days, after which borrowings against each asset-specific borrowing required repayment. This facility was 100% recourse to Holdco. We allowed this credit facility to expire by its terms on July 12, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we had no balance outstanding under the facility.
Asset-Specific Financings
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any asset-specific financing arrangements to finance certain of our lending activities. On April 2, 2019, we entered into an asset-specific financing with an institutional lender that was secured by one first mortgage loan held for investment. The asset-specific financing did not provide for additional advances. The initial maturity of this agreement was October 9, 2020. On October 9, 2020, the first mortgage loan reached final maturity without repayment or satisfaction of extension conditions, which triggered a maturity default. On December 31, 2020, we took ownership of the Property pursuant to a negotiated deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and retired the asset-specific financing arrangement.
Non-Consolidated Senior Interests
In certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our consolidated balance sheets. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan.
As of December 31, 2020, we retained a mezzanine loan investment with a total commitment of $35.0 million, an unpaid principal balance of $32.5 million and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 10.3%.
The following table presents our non-consolidated senior interests outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Financial Covenants for Outstanding Borrowings
Our financial covenants and guarantees for outstanding borrowings related to our secured credit agreements require Holdco to maintain compliance with the following financial covenants (among others), which were revised on May 28, 2020 as follows:
The amendments as of May 28, 2020 revise the definition of tangible net worth such that the baseline amount for testing is reset as of April 1, 2020 to $1.1 billion plus 75% of future equity issuances after April 1, 2020. The definition of equity for purposes of calculating the debt-to-equity covenant was revised to include: common equity; preferred equity; and an adjustment equal to the sum of the Current Expected Credit Loss reserve, write-downs, impairments or realized losses recorded against the value of any assets of Holdco or its subsidiaries from and after April 1, 2020; provided, however, that the equity adjustment may not exceed the amount of (a) Holdco’s total equity less (b) the product of Holdco’s total indebtedness multiplied by 25%.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants for our secured credit agreements, secured revolving credit agreement, and asset-specific financings to the extent of outstanding balances as of December 31, 2020.
For as long as the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding, we are required to maintain a debt to equity ratio not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. For the purpose of determining this ratio, the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock is excluded from the calculation of our total indebtedness and our subsidiaries and is included in the calculation of total equity. We were in compliance with the financial covenant relating to the Series B Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2020.
If we fail to meet or satisfy any of the covenants in our financing arrangements and are unable to obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders, we would be in default under these agreements, which could result in a cross-default or cross-acceleration under other financing arrangements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable (or such amounts may automatically become due and payable), terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. A default also could limit significantly our financing alternatives, which could cause us to curtail our investment activities or dispose of assets when we otherwise would not choose to do so. Further, this could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with these covenants in the future. For more information regarding the impact that COVID-19 may have on our ability to comply with these covenants, see “Risk Factors.”
Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio
The following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio and total leverage ratio:
(1)
Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under financing arrangements, net, including collateralized loan obligations, secured credit facilities, secured revolving credit facilities, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financing agreements, less cash, to (ii) total stockholders’ equity, at period end.
(2)
Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under financing arrangements, net, including collateralized loan obligations, secured credit facilities, secured revolving credit facilities, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financing agreements, plus non-consolidated senior interests sold or co-originated (if any), less cash, to (ii) total stockholders’ equity, at period end.
Floating Rate Portfolio
Our business model seeks to minimize our exposure to changing interest rates by match-indexing our assets using the same, or similar, benchmark indices, typically LIBOR. Accordingly, rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income, subject to the beneficial impact of LIBOR floors in our mortgage loan investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, 100.0% of our loans by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that require interest payments based on floating rates, which resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of net floating rate exposure, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on all our floating rate loans and 11.7% of our liabilities. We had no fixed rate loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Our liabilities are generally index-matched to each loan investment asset, resulting in a net exposure to movements in benchmark rates that vary based on the relative proportion of floating rate assets and liabilities. The following table details our loan portfolio’s net floating rate exposure as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Floating rate mortgage loan assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR. The net exposure to the underlying benchmark interest rate is directly correlated to our assets indexed to the same rate. Excludes the impact of CRE debt securities and related liabilities.
(2)
Floating rate liabilities include secured credit facilities, collateralized loan obligations, secured revolving credit facilities, a term loan facility, and asset-specific financings.
With the cessation of LIBOR expected to occur effective January 1, 2022, we continue to evaluate the documentation and control processes associated with our assets and liabilities to manage the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative rate endorsed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve System. Although recent statements from regulators indicate the possibility of a longer period of transition, perhaps through June 2023, we continue to utilize required resources to revise our control and risk management systems to ensure there is no disruption to our day-to-day operations from the transition, when it does occur. We will continue to employ prudent risk management as it relates to the potential financial, operational and legal risks associated with the expected cessation of LIBOR, and to ensure that our assets and liabilities generally remain match-indexed following this event.

Our Results of Operations
Operating Results
The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased $11.5 million, to $176.4 million, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to the benefit of LIBOR floors with a weighted average strike price of 1.66% and a reduction in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $67.6 million as a result of a reduction in LIBOR, and the absence of LIBOR floors on 88.3% of our borrowings, both as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Revenue
Other revenue is comprised of interest income earned on certain cash collection accounts, and miscellaneous fee income. Other revenue decreased by $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower overnight interest earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Expenses
Other expenses increased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Significant changes in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 include:
•
an increase of $5.3 million in professional fees due primarily to an increase in legal, accounting and advisory fee expenses incurred in connection with our response to COVID-19; and
•
an increase of $3.2 million in stock compensation expense due primarily to grants made in 2019; offset by
•
a decrease of $7.1 million in incentive compensation earned by our Manager due to a reduction in our Core Earnings, as defined in our Management Agreement, resulting in no incentive compensation being earned by our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for details regarding our Management Agreement; and
•
a decrease of $0.8 million in management fees due to a reduction in our Core Earnings as defined in our Management Agreement.
We incurred total non-recurring expenses caused by COVID-19 of $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, and none during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Securities Impairments
Securities impairment expense of $203.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 include losses on sales of CRE debt securities of $203.5 million, offset by a $0.1 million realized gain on sale of one position in connection with CRE debt securities owned at March 31, 2020. We had no such impairment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Credit Loss Expense
Credit loss expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to $69.8 million due to a $43.2 million credit loss expense recorded in accordance with ASU 2016-13 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and realized losses of $12.8 million on the extinguishment of a loan and conversion to real estate owned, and $13.8 million on the sale of a loan. This increase reflects the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loans, particularly those collateralized by hospitality assets, and a $10.0 million specific reserve on one first mortgage loan secured by a retail property.
Dividends Declared Per Common Share
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we declared cash dividends of $1.21 per common share, or $93.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared cash dividends of $1.72 per common share, or $128.4 million. The decrease in dividends declared was primarily due to a decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of $281.2 million, offset by an increase in common shares outstanding of 0.8 million.
Unrealized (Loss) Gain on CRE Debt Securities
Other comprehensive (loss) income decreased $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily related to the reversal of unrealized gains upon the sale of certain CRE debt securities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Capitalization
We have capitalized our business to date through, among other things, the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, issuance of preferred stock treated as temporary equity, issuance of common stock warrants, borrowings under secured credit agreements, collateralized loan obligations, asset-specific financings, a mortgage loan, and non-consolidated senior interests. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding 76.8 million shares of our common stock representing $1.3 billion of stockholders’ equity, $199.6 million of temporary equity and $3.4 billion of outstanding borrowings used to finance our operations.
See Notes 6 and 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our borrowings under secured credit agreements, collateralized loan obligations, and a mortgage loan payable. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase Common Stock.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under secured credit agreements and capacity in our collateralized loan obligations available for reinvestment, which are set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Subject to collateral eligibility requirements.
Our existing loan portfolio provides us with liquidity as loans are repaid or sold, in whole or in part, of which some proceeds may be included in accounts receivable from our servicers until released and the proceeds from such repayments become available for us to reinvest. Due to severe dislocation in the capital markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of loan repayments is reduced in comparison to prior years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, loan repayments, measured by principal amount repaid, totaled $1.0 billion, and loan sales were $145.7 million. Loan repayments, measured by principal amount repaid, were $1.9 billion in 2019.
We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our borrowers, their tenants, our lenders and the economy as a whole. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on our operations and liquidity, are uncertain and continue to evolve in the United States and globally. If the pandemic sustains its current trajectory, such impacts are expected to remain material. To the extent that our borrowers, their tenants, and our lenders continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, or by the other risks disclosed in this Form 10-K, it would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.
Uses of Liquidity
In the past, our primary use of liquidity was the origination of first mortgage loans, the purchase of CRE CLO debt securities (discontinued in March 2020), interest and principal payments under our $3.4 billion of outstanding borrowings under secured credit agreements, collateralized loan obligations, secured revolving credit agreements, mortgage loan payable (beginning in December 2020), asset-specific financings, $423.5 million of unfunded loan commitments, dividend distributions to our preferred and common stockholders, and operating expenses.
As described above, each of our secured credit facilities has “margin maintenance” provisions, which are designed to allow the lender to maintain a certain margin of credit enhancement against the assets which serve as collateral. On May 28, 2020, we made voluntary deleveraging payments totaling $157.7 million to seven of our secured credit facility lenders that provide financing secured by certain of our first mortgage loan investments, in
exchange for their agreement to suspend margin calls through December 2020, subject to certain conditions. At the time these payments were made, no margin deficits existed, and no margin calls have been issued to us since. If market turbulence persists or resurges, we may be required to post cash collateral in connection with our secured credit agreements secured by our mortgage loan investments. For more information regarding the impact that COVID-19 has had on our liquidity and may have on our future liquidity, see “Risk Factors.”
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (dollars in thousands):
(1)
The allocation of our unfunded loan commitments is based on the earlier of the commitment expiration date and the loan maturity date.
(2)
The allocation of secured debt agreements is based on the extended maturity date for those credit facilities where extensions are at our option, subject to no default, or the current maturity date of those facilities where extension options are subject to counterparty approval.
(3)
Collateralized loan obligation liabilities are based on the fully extended maturity of mortgage loan collateral, considering the reinvestment window of our collateralized loan obligation.
(4)
Amounts include the related future interest payment obligations, which are estimated by assuming the amounts outstanding under our secured debt agreements and collateralized loan obligations and the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 will remain constant into the future. This is only an estimate, as actual amounts borrowed and rates will vary over time. Our floating rate loans and related liabilities are indexed to LIBOR.
(5)
Series B Preferred Stock dividends are computed at 11% per annum, with up to 2 percentage points payable in additional preferred stock at the discretion of the issuer.
With respect to our debt obligations that are contractually due within the next five years, we plan to employ several strategies to meet these obligations, including: (i) exercising maturity date extension options that exist in our current financing arrangements; (ii) negotiating extensions of terms with our providers of credit; (iii) periodically accessing the public and private equity and debt capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments or the repayment of indebtedness; (iv) the issuance of additional structured finance vehicles, such as a collateralized loan obligations similar to TRTX 2019-FL3 or TRTX 2018-FL2, as a method of financing; (v) term loans with private lenders; (vi) selling loans to generate cash to repay our debt obligations; and/or (vii) applying repayments from underlying loans to satisfy the debt obligations which they secure. Although many of these avenues have been available to us in the past, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to access any or all of these alternatives as a result of the continuing market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are required to pay our Manager a base management fee, an incentive fee, and reimbursements for certain expenses pursuant to our Management Agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our Management Agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. No incentive fee was earned by our Manager during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our Management Agreement.
As a REIT, we generally must distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to stockholders in the form of dividends to comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In 2017, the Internal Revenue Service issued a revenue procedure permitting “publicly offered” REITs to make elective stock dividends (i.e. dividends paid in a mixture of stock and cash), with at least 20% of the total distribution being paid in cash, to satisfy their REIT distribution requirements. Pursuant to this revenue procedure, we may elect to make future distributions of our taxable income in a mixture of stock and cash.
Our REIT taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP or our Distributable Earnings as described above. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional details
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Cash Flows
The following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (dollars in thousands):
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $132.1 million primarily related to net interest income.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020 cash flows from investing activities totaled $964.6 million primarily due to repayments on loans held for investment of $819.8 million, sale of CRE debt securities totaling $766.4 million and proceeds from sale of loans of $131.9 million, offset by new loan originations of $351.7 million and purchases of CRE debt securities of $168.9 million and advances on loans of $233.0 million.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in financing activities totaled $856.7 million primarily due to payments on secured financing agreements of $2.3 billion and payment of dividends on our common stock, Series A and Series B Preferred Stock of $111.6 million, offset by additional proceeds from secured financing agreements of $1.3 billion, and the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants of $225.0 million.
Entirely during the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020, we received margin call notices with respect to borrowings against our CRE CLO investment portfolio aggregating $170.9 million, which were satisfied with a combination of $89.8 million of cash on hand, cash proceeds from bond sales, and increases in market values prior to quarter-end. At March 31, 2020, unpaid margin calls totaled $19.0 million, which were satisfied in April through cash proceeds from bond sales and increases in market value. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, prior to making our voluntary deleveraging payments, we satisfied one margin call aggregating $20.0 million in connection with our secured credit agreements financing our loan investments by pledging a previously unencumbered loan investment.
On May 28, 2020, we made voluntary deleveraging payments totaling $157.7 million to seven of our secured credit facility lenders that provide financing for certain of our first mortgage loan investments in exchange for their agreement to suspend margin calls through December 2020, subject to certain conditions. At the time these payments were made, no margin deficits existed, and no margin calls have been issued to us since. If market turbulence persists or resurges, we may be required to post cash collateral in connection with our secured credit agreements secured by our mortgage loan investments pledged under these borrowing arrangements. We maintain frequent dialogue with the lenders under our secured credit agreements regarding our management of their collateral assets in light of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information regarding the impact that COVID-19 has had on our liquidity and may have on our future liquidity, see “Risk Factors.”
Corporate Activities
Issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
On May 28, 2020, we entered into an Investment Agreement with the Purchaser, an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group Global II, L.P., under which we agreed to issue and sell to the Purchaser up to 13 million shares of the our 11.0% Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (plus any additional such shares paid as dividends pursuant to the Articles Supplementary, the “Series B Preferred Stock”), and Warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 15 million shares (subject to adjustment) of our Common Stock, for an aggregate cash purchase price of up to $325.0 million. Such purchases could occur in up to three tranches. The Investment Agreement contains market standard provisions regarding board representation, voting agreements, rights to information, and a standstill agreement and registration rights agreement regarding common stock acquired through the exercise of Warrants. The foregoing descriptions of the Investment Agreement and the various components are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Investment Agreement, the Articles Supplementary, the Warrant Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Amendments, which are attached as exhibits to the our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 29, 2020, and incorporated herein by reference.
On May 28, 2020, the Purchaser acquired the first tranche under the Investment Agreement, consisting of 9.0 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase up to 12.0 million shares of Common Stock, for an aggregate price of $225.0 million. We retained an option to sell to the Purchaser the second and third tranches on or prior to December 31, 2020. Each of the second and third tranches consisted of 2.0 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase up to 1.5 million shares of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $50.0 million per tranche. We allowed the option to issue additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock to expire unused.
None of the Warrants were exercised as of December 31, 2020.
Details of this issuance have been described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Offering of Common Stock
On March 7, 2019, we and our Manager entered into an equity distribution agreement with each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JMP Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and TPG Capital BD, LLC (each a “Sales Agent” and, collectively, the “Sales Agents”) relating to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to a continuous offering program. In accordance with the terms of the equity distribution agreement, we may, at our discretion and from time to time, offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $125.0 million through the Sales Agents, each acting as our agent. The offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to the equity distribution agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of shares of our common stock subject to the equity distribution agreement having an aggregate gross sales price of $125.0 million and (2) the termination of the equity distribution agreement by the Sales Agents or us at any time as set forth in the equity distribution agreement. At December 31, 2020, cumulative gross proceeds issued under the equity distribution agreement totaled $50.9 million, leaving $74.1 million available for future issuance subject to the direction of management, and market conditions.
Each Sales Agent will be entitled to commissions in an amount not to exceed 1.75% of the gross sales prices of shares of our common stock sold through it, as our agent. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we sold 0.6 million shares of common stock pursuant to the equity distribution agreement at a weighted average price per share of $20.53, generating gross proceeds of $12.9 million. We paid commissions totaling $0.2 million.
Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our issuances of equity securities in recent years.
Dividends
Upon the approval of our Board of Directors, we accrue dividends. Dividends are paid first to the holders of our Series A preferred stock at the rate of 12.5% of the total $0.001 million liquidation preference per annum plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, then to holders of our Series B Preferred Stock at the rate of 11.0% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference, and then to the holders of our common stock. We intend to distribute each year substantially all our taxable income to our stockholders to comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Board of Directors will determine whether to pay future dividends, entirely in cash, or in a combination of stock and cash based on facts and circumstances at the time such decisions are made.
On December 15, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the amount of $0.20 per share of common stock, or $15.5 million in the aggregate. On December 15, 2020, our Board of Directors also declared a special cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock, or $14.0 million in the aggregate, attributable to our estimated 2020 REIT taxable income which was previously undistributed. The fourth quarter regular and special dividend was paid on January 22, 2021 to holders of record of our common stock as of December 28, 2020.
On December 15, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the amount of $0.69 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, or $6.2 million in the aggregate, which was paid on December 31, 2020 to the holder of record of our Series B Preferred Stock as of December 15, 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, common stock and Class A common stock dividends in the amount of $93.6 million and $128.4 million, respectively, were declared and approved.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Series B Preferred Stock dividends in the amount of $14.7 million were approved and paid.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $29.5 million and $32.8 million, respectively, remain unpaid and are reflected in dividends payable on our consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes
We made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws.
Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal income and excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to material penalties as well as U.S. federal, state and local income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years. We believe we have complied with all REIT requirements since our initial taxable year.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, interest income and other revenue recognition, allowance for loan losses, expense recognition, tax liability, future impairment of our investments, valuation of our investment portfolio and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, among other items. Our management bases these estimates and judgments about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses.
If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that our judgments, estimates and assumptions described below could change, which may result in a change in our interest income and other revenue recognition, allowance for loan losses, expense recognition, tax liability, future write-off of our investments, and valuation of our investment portfolio, among other effects. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions.
During 2020, our Manager reviewed and evaluated our critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate. The following is a summary of our significant accounting policies that we believe are the most affected by our Manager’s judgments, estimates, and assumptions:
Revenue Recognition
Interest income on loans is accrued using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan, adjusted for expected or realized credit losses, if any. The objective of the interest method is to arrive at periodic interest income, including recognition of fees and costs, at a constant effective yield. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the loans using the interest method, or on a straight-line basis when it approximates the interest method. Extension and modification fees are accreted into income on a straight-line basis, when it approximates the interest method, over the related extension or modification period. Exit fees are accreted into income on a straight-line basis, when it approximates the interest method, over the lives of the loans to which they relate unless they can be waived by us or a co-lender in connection with a loan refinancing. Prepayment penalties from borrowers are recognized as interest income when received. Certain of our loan investments have in the past and may in the future provide for additional interest based on the borrower’s operating cash flow or appreciation of the underlying collateral. Such amounts are considered contingent interest and are reflected as interest income only upon certainty of collection. Certain of our loan investments have in the past, and may in the future, provide for the accrual of interest (in part, or in whole) instead of its current payment in cash, with the accrued interest (“PIK interest”) added to the unpaid principal balance of the loan. Such PIK interest is recognized currently as interest income unless we conclude eventual collection is unlikely, in which case a collection reserve is recorded or the PIK interest is written off.
We consider a loan to be non-performing and place the loan on non-accrual status when the full and timely collection of principal and interest is doubtful, generally when: (1) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of a default; (2) the loan becomes 90 days or more past due for principal and interest; or (3) the loan experiences a maturity default. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual status is subtracted from interest income at the time the loan is placed on non-accrual. Based on our judgment as to the collectability of principal, a loan on non-accrual status is either accounted for on a cash basis, where interest income is recognized only upon receipt of cash for principal and interest payments, or on a cost-recovery basis, where all cash receipts reduce the loan’s carrying value, and interest income is only recorded when such carrying value has been fully recovered.
As of December 31, 2020, one loan secured by a retail property was placed on non-accrual status due to a borrower default during the fourth quarter of 2020. The amortized cost of the loan was $31.1 million as of December 31, 2020. No loans were placed on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2019.
Credit Losses
As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) and subsequent amendments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model. CECL amends the previous credit loss model to reflect a reporting entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The CECL model applies to our mortgage loan investment portfolio measured at amortized cost and unfunded loan commitments.
We license from Trepp, LLC historical loss information, incorporating loan performance data for over 100,000 commercial real estate loans dating back to 1998, in an analytical model to compute statistical credit loss factors (i.e., probability-of-default and loss-given-default). These statistical credit loss factors are utilized together with individual loan information to generate future expected cash flows which are used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. Such determination also incorporates significant assumptions and estimates regarding, among other things, prepayments, future fundings and economic forecasts.
Quarterly, we evaluate the risk of all loans and assign a risk rating based on a variety of factors, grouped as follows: (i) loan and credit structure, including the as-is LTV and structural features; (ii) quality and stability of real estate value and operating cash flow, including debt yield, property type, dynamics of the geography, property type and local market, physical condition, stability of cash flow, leasing velocity and quality and diversity of tenancy; (iii) performance against underwritten business plan; and (iv) quality, experience and financial condition of sponsor, borrower and guarantor(s). Based on a 5-point scale, our loans are rated “1” through “5,” from least risk to greatest risk, respectively, which ratings are defined as follows:
Outperform-Exceeds performance metrics (for example, technical milestones, occupancy, rents, net operating income) included in original or current credit underwriting and business plan;
Meets or Exceeds Expectations-Collateral performance meets or exceeds substantially all performance metrics included in original or current underwriting / business plan;
Satisfactory-Collateral performance meets or is on track to meet underwriting; business plan is met or can reasonably be achieved;
Underperformance-Collateral performance falls short of original underwriting, material differences exist from business plan, or both; technical milestones have been missed; defaults may exist, or may soon occur absent material improvement; and
Default/Possibility of Loss-Collateral performance is significantly worse than underwriting; major variance from business plan; loan covenants or technical milestones have been breached; timely exit from loan via sale or refinancing is questionable; significant risk of principal loss.
We generally assign a risk rating of “3” to all loan investments originated during the most recent quarter, except in the case of specific circumstances warranting an exception.
The amount of allowance for credit losses is influenced by the size of our loan portfolio, loan asset quality, risk rating, delinquency status, historic loss experience and macroeconomic and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We employ two methods to estimate credit losses in its loan portfolio: a model-based approach utilized for substantially all of our loans; and an individually-assessed approach for loans that we conclude are ill-suited for use in the model-based approach, or are individually-assessed based on accounting guidance contained in the CECL framework. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of our methodologies.
Significant judgment is required when estimating future credit losses; therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. As of December 31, 2020, we held $4.5 billion of loans measured at amortized cost with expected future funding commitments of $423.5 million. We recognized a net credit loss expense of $43.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and the related credit loss allowance was $62.8 million as of December 31, 2020.
See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a listing and description of our significant accounting policies.
Subsequent Events
The following events occurred subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2020:
•
On February 16, 2020, we extended for a term of one year, through May 4, 2022, the existing secured credit facility with Morgan Stanley Bank with a commitment amount of $500.0 million.
•
As of February 23, 2021, we are in the process of closing one first mortgage loan with a total commitment of $50.2 million, and an expected initial funding amount of $47.7 million. This loan will be funded with a combination of cash-on-hand and borrowings.
Loan Portfolio Details
The following table provides details with respect to our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions, except loan per square foot/unit):
(1)
First mortgage loans are whole mortgage loans unless otherwise noted. Loans numbered 53, 54, 55 and 56 represent 24% pari passu participation interests in whole mortgage loans.
(2)
Date loan was originated or acquired by us, which date has not been updated for subsequent loan modifications.
(3)
Represents unpaid principal balance net of unamortized costs.
(4)
Represents the formula pursuant to which our right to receive a cash coupon on a loan is determined.
(5)
In addition to credit spread, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, purchase price premium and discount, loan origination costs and accrual of both extension and exit fees. All-in yield for the total portfolio assumes the applicable floating benchmark rate as of December 31, 2020 for weighted average calculations.
(6)
Extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2020, based on unpaid principal balance, 31.7% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 68.3% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty.
(7)
Except for construction loans, LTV is calculated for loan originations and existing loans as the total outstanding principal balance of the loan or participation interest in a loan (plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan or participation interest) divided by the as-is real estate value at the time of origination or acquisition of such loan or participation interest. For construction loans only, LTV is calculated as the total commitment amount of the loan divided by the as-stabilized value of the real estate securing the loan. The as-is or as-stabilized (as applicable) value reflects our Manager’s estimates, at the time of origination or acquisition of the loan or participation interest in a loan, of the real estate value underlying such loan or participation interest determined in accordance with our Manager’s underwriting standards and consistent with third-party appraisals obtained by our Manager.
(8)
For a discussion of risk ratings, please see Notes 2 and 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
(9)
Represents the weighted average of the credit spread as of December 31, 2020 for the loans, all of which are floating rate.
(10)
Reflects the total loan amount, including non-consolidated senior interest, allocable to the property’s 135 hotel rooms. Excludes other improvements planned for the remainder of the project site.
(11)
This loan is comprised of a first mortgage loan of $106.3 million and a contiguous mezzanine loan of $93.7 million, of which we own both. Each loan carries the same interest rate.
(12)
Calculated as the ratio of unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2020 to the as-is appraised value at origination, to reflect the sale by us in August 2020 of the contiguous mezzanine loan with an unpaid principal balance of $46.4 million and a commitment amount of $50.0 million.
