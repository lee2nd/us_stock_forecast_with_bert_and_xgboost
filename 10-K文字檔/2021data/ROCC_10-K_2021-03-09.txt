Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” All dollar amounts presented in the tables that follow are in thousands unless otherwise indicated. Also, due to the combination of different units of volumetric measure and the number of decimal places presented and rounding, certain results may not calculate explicitly from the values presented in the tables. Certain statistics for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation.
Overview and Executive Summary
We are an independent oil and gas company focused on the onshore exploration, development and production of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Our current operations consist of drilling unconventional horizontal development wells and operating our producing wells in Gonzales, Lavaca, Fayette and DeWitt Counties in South Texas.
Industry Environment and Recent Operating and Financial Highlights
Commodity Price and Other Economic Conditions
The global public health crisis associated with the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has, and is anticipated to continue to have, an adverse effect on the global economy, which may be prolonged, and has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures, limitations to person-to-person contact and the institution of quarantining and other restrictions on movement in many communities. These restrictions resulted in a dramatic decline in the demand for energy in 2020, which directly impacted our industry and the Company. In addition, global crude oil prices experienced significant decline since the beginning of 2020 as a result of the dual impact of demand deterioration and market oversupply caused by disagreements between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and Russia, together with OPEC, collectively OPEC+, with respect to production curtailments. OPEC+ ultimately agreed to specified reductions in production in the Spring of 2020 which, for the most part, held for the remainder of the year and were supplemented by additional voluntary downward adjustments, led primarily by Saudi Arabia. Collectively these curtailments have contributed to a relative stabilization of commodity prices and rebalancing of the global crude oil markets by the end of 2020.
Notwithstanding the relative improvement in global market stability, as a result of several factors including rising infection rates at the beginning of 2021, mutating strains of the virus, the return of stricter lockdown measures and logistical challenges in vaccine distribution, among others, a return to pre-COVID 19 levels of economic activity remain uncertain in their magnitude and eventual timing. Nonetheless, OPEC+ indicated in their January 2021 meeting a commitment to gradually return limited production to the market with the pace being determined by market conditions. An additional meeting is scheduled for early March of 2021 to monitor conditions and progress.
A significant decline in domestic drilling by U.S. producers began in mid-March 2020 and continued through most of the second half of the year. The overall economic decline had an adverse impact on the entire industry, but particularly on smaller upstream producers with limited financial resources as well as oilfield service companies. While a modest recovery in activity began in the fourth quarter of 2020, including a resumption of our own drilling program, domestic supply and demand imbalances continue to stress the market which is further exacerbated by capacity limitations associated with storage, pipeline and refining infrastructure, particularly within the Gulf Coast region.
While there exists encouraging signs for continued recovery due to the aforementioned vaccine development as well as a commitment by the new U.S. Administration to prioritize economic relief efforts, the relative success of such efforts is difficult to predict with respect to timing and the resulting economic impact. Accordingly, the combined effect of the global and domestic factors discussed herein is anticipated to continue to contribute to overall volatility within the industry generally and to our operations specifically.
The combined effect of COVID-19 and the continuing energy industry instability has led to significant volatility in NYMEX WTI crude oil prices throughout 2020 and into 2021. In the beginning of January 2020, prices were approximately $62 per barrel and ended the year at approximately $48 per barrel for a decrease of approximately 23 percent. Prices have continued to rise and since the beginning of 2021 have ranged from approximately $47 to $66 per barrel through March 5, 2021. Despite this recovery, overall crude oil pricing will remain subject to significant volatility consistent with the global and domestic factors discussed above.
During 2020, we initiated several actions to mitigate the anticipated adverse economic conditions for the immediate future and to support our financial position and liquidity. The more significant actions that we took during that time included: (i) temporarily suspending our drilling program from April through September 30, 2020, (ii) curtailing production through selected well shut-ins for a period of several weeks in April and May, (iii) securing additional crude oil storage capacity, (iv) substantially expanding the scope and range of our commodity derivatives portfolio, (v) utilizing certain provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and related regulations, the most significant of which resulted in the receipt in June 2020 of an accelerated refund of our remaining refundable alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credit carryforwards in the amount of $2.5 million and (vi) eliminating annual cost-of-living and similar adjustments to our salaries and wages for 2020, and a limited RIF during the third quarter of 2020.
These actions are described in greater detail in the discussions for Key Developments that follow as well as Notes 2, 6, 10 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Capital Expenditures and Development Progress
We temporarily suspended our drilling program from April through September 2020. During that period, we selectively completed and turned our remaining eight gross (7.6 net) wells to sales that were drilled prior to the program suspension. As a result of a modest improvement in commodity prices relative to the first half of 2020, we resumed a limited drilling program in October 2020 with one rig and expanded to two rigs later in November 2020 continuing into 2021.
During 2020, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $130.6 million with 96 percent directed to drilling and completion projects through which a total of 23 gross (20.6 net) wells were drilled, completed and turned to sales.
Sequential Quarterly Analysis
The following summarizes our key operating and financial highlights for the three months ended December 31, 2020 with comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2020 as presented in the table that follows. The year-over-year highlights for 2020 and 2019 are addressed in further detail in the discussions for Financial Condition and Results of Operations that follow.
•Daily sales volume decreased approximately 12 percent to 21,502 BOEPD, from 24,295 BOEPD due primarily to the effect of natural well declines in the absence of an active drilling program that did not resume until October of 2020 as well as the impact of turning only two gross (2.0 net) wells to sales during the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to five gross (4.8 net) wells during the third quarter of 2020. Total sales volume declined approximately 12 percent to 1,978 MBOE from 2,235 MBOE due to the aforementioned natural well declines and drilling program timing. While overall sales volume declined, the percentage of crude oil volume sold increased to 78 percent from 76 percent during the fourth quarter of 2020.
•Product revenues decreased three percent to $66.5 million from $68.6 million due primarily to nine percent lower crude oil volume, or $5.7 million, partially offset by six percent higher crude oil prices, or $3.5 million. NGL revenues declined six percent due to 19 percent lower volume, or $0.6 million, partially offset by 16 percent higher prices, or $0.4 million. Natural gas revenues increased 10 percent due to a 36 percent increase in pricing, or $0.8 million, partially offset by a 19 percent decrease in volume, or $0.5 million.
•Production and lifting costs (consisting of LOE and GPT) increased on an absolute and per unit basis to $14.8 million and $7.49 per BOE from $14.0 million and $6.28 per BOE due primarily to higher preventive and other previously deferred maintenance and workover costs, higher environmental compliance costs as well as higher crude oil storage costs partially offset by lower volumetric and variable-based costs attributable to the overall lower sales volume.
•Production and ad valorem taxes decreased on an absolute and per unit basis to $3.5 million and $1.75 per BOE from $4.4 million and $1.95 per BOE, respectively, due primarily to the effect of substantially lower estimated valuations for ad valorem tax assessments as well as the effect of overall lower product revenues.
•G&A expenses increased on an absolute and per unit basis to $10.0 million and $5.05 per BOE from $8.6 million and $3.84 per BOE, respectively, due primarily to higher costs incurred in connection with the Juniper Transaction.
•Our DD&A, decreased on an absolute and per unit basis to $25.8 million and $13.03 per BOE from $37.0 million and $16.57 per BOE due primarily to higher reserve quantity estimates and, to a lesser extent, the reduction to costs attributable to the impairment recorded during the third quarter of 2020.
•In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment of our oil and gas properties of $120.3 million as the unamortized cost of our oil and gas properties, net of deferred income taxes, exceeded the sum of discounted future net revenues from proved properties adjusted for costs excluded from amortization and related income taxes, or the Ceiling Test. The impairment is primarily attributable to a decline in the trailing twelve-month average prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. We recorded an impairment of $236.0 million as a result of similar conditions in the third quarter of 2020.
•Due to the combined impact of the matters noted in the bullets above, we incurred an operating loss of $107.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $230.6 million in the third quarter of 2020.
The following table sets forth certain historical summary operating and financial statistics for the periods presented:
_____________________________________________

7 The borrowing base under the Credit Facility was $375 million as December 31, 2020 with availability further limited to a maximum of $350 million.
Key Developments
The following general business developments had or may have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows:
Strategic Investment by Juniper
In January 2021, we consummated the previously announced Juniper Transactions whereby affiliates of Juniper contributed $150 million in cash and certain oil and gas assets in Lavaca and Fayette Counties in Texas in exchange for a combination of shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company and Common Units of a wholly owned subsidiary. The Juniper Transactions, which were effectuated through an up-C structure, represent a change in control of the Company whereby Juniper now controls approximately 60 percent of the economic and voting interests of the Company. We incurred a total of $18.5 million in transaction and securities issuance costs associated with the Juniper Transactions including $5.0 million in 2020 as well as an additional $13.5 million in January 2021. For additional information regarding the Juniper Transactions, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Amendments to Credit Facility and Affirmation of Borrowing Base
In January 2021, we entered into the Ninth Amendment permitting the Juniper Transactions and affirming our borrowing base at $375 million with borrowings limited to a maximum of $350 million. In addition, the Ninth Amendment provides for: (i) certain minimum hedging conditions, which were initially satisfied in February 2021, allowing for a borrowing base holiday until Fall 2021 assuming we continue to satisfy the conditions, (ii) introduces a first lien leverage ratio covenant of 2.50 times, tested quarterly and (iii) permits amortization payments of up to $1.875 million per quarter to be made under the Second Lien Facility until January 2022 if no default exists both before and after giving effect to the payments and thereafter using available free cash flow upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (including maintaining a leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and availability of at least 25% under the Credit Facility after giving pro forma effect to the payment). For additional information regarding the Ninth Amendment see the discussion of Financial Condition that follows and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Concurrent with the Ninth Amendment, we paid down $80.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility plus accrued interest of $0.1 million which was funded with the proceeds from the Juniper Transaction. We incurred and capitalized $0.4 million of issue and other costs associated with the Ninth Amendment in January 2021.
Amendment to the Second Lien Facility
On November 2, 2020, we entered into the Second Lien Amendment which became effective upon the Closing of the Juniper Transactions. The Second Lien Amendment (1) extends the maturity date of the Second Lien Facility to September 29, 2024, (2) increases the margin applicable to advances under the Second Lien Facility as further described below; (3) impose certain limitations on capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments if the Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined therein) at the end of any fiscal quarter is less than 1.25 to 1.00 and (4) requires maximum and, in certain circumstances as described therein, minimum hedging arrangements.
Under the Second Lien Amendment, the Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments equal to $1,875,000 and outstanding borrowings under the Second Lien Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a customary reference rate based on the prime rate plus an applicable margin of 8.25% or (b) a customary London interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin of 7.25%; provided that the applicable margin will increase to 9.25% and 8.25% respectively during any quarter in which the quarterly amortization payment is not made.
We have the right, to the extent permitted under the Credit Facility and an intercreditor agreement between the lenders under the Credit Facility and the lenders under the Second Lien Facility, to prepay loans under the Second Lien Facility at any time, subject to the following prepayment premiums (in addition to customary “breakage” costs with respect to Eurodollar loans): from January 15, 2021 through January 14, 2022, 102% of the amount being prepaid, from January 15, 2022 through January 14, 2023, 101% of the amount being prepaid; and thereafter, no premium. The Second Lien Facility also provides for the following prepayment premiums in the event of a change in control that results in an offer of prepayment that is accepted by the lenders under the Second Lien Facility: from January 15, 2021 through January 14, 2023, 102% of the amount being prepaid, from January 15, 2023 through January 14, 2024, 101% of the amount being prepaid; and thereafter, no premium.
Additionally, on the Closing Date, we entered into the Omnibus Amendment to the Second Lien Facility (the “Omnibus Amendment”) to, among other things, effectuate the release of the Company from its guarantee of the obligations of the Borrower and its grant of a security interest in its assets.
Additional restrictions and other qualifications associated with the Second Lien Facility, as amended by the Second Lien Amendment and the Omnibus Amendment, or the Amended Second Lien Facility, are described in the discussion of Financial Condition that follows and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We paid down $50.0 million of outstanding loans under the Amended Second Lien Facility plus accrued interest of $0.2 million attributable to lenders and $1.3 million including accrued interest to a non-consenting lender in January 2021 which was funded with the proceeds from the Juniper Transaction. We incurred and capitalized $1.4 million of issue and other costs and wrote-off $1.3 million of unamortized issuance costs in connection with the Second Lien Amendment in January 2021.
Development Plans and Production
In October 2020, we resumed a limited drilling and completion program on a pad-to-pad basis and are currently drilling with two operated rigs. During December 2020, we made prepayments of $13.6 million for drilling and completion materials and services securing locked in rates or discounts in advance of the program for the first quarter of 2021.
We completed and turned two gross (2.0 net) and 23 gross (20.6 net) wells to sales during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we turned an additional five gross (4.5 net) wells to sales through March 5, 2021. As of March 5, 2021, three gross (2.8 net) wells were completing and nine gross (7.1 net) wells were in progress.
Total sales volume for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020 was 1,978 MBOE and 8,887 MBOE, or 21,502 and 24,281 BOEPD, with approximately 78 percent and 77 percent, or 1,538 MBbls and 6,829 MBbls, of sales volume from crude oil, 12 and 13 percent from NGLs and 10 percent for both periods each from natural gas, respectively.
As of March 5, 2021, we had approximately 102,100 gross (90,100 net) acres in the Eagle Ford, net of expirations. Approximately 92 percent of our acreage is held by production and substantially all is operated by us.
Executive Transition
In August 2020, we appointed Darrin Henke our new president and chief executive officer, or CEO, and director following the retirement of John Brooks. We incurred incremental G&A costs, in connection with Mr. Henke’s appointment and Mr. Brooks’ separation as described in the discussion for Results of Operations that follow.
On January 15, 2021, we announced the departure of Benjamin A. Mathis, Senior Vice President, Operations & Engineering, effective January 4, 2021. Separately, we also announced the appointment of Julia Gwaltney as Senior Vice President, Development, effective January 5, 2021.
In connection with the Juniper Transactions, five new members were appointed to our Board of Directors including: (i) Edward Geiser - Managing Partner of Juniper Capital, (ii) Kevin Cumming - Partner of Juniper Capital, (iii) Tim Gray - General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of Juniper Capital, (iv) Joshua Schmidt - Managing Director of Juniper Capital and (v) Temitope Ogunyomi - Director of Juniper Capital.
Actions to Address the Economic Impact of COVID-19 and Industry Decline
During 2020, we initiated and pursued several actions to mitigate the adverse economic conditions and to support our financial position, liquidity and the efficient continuity of our operations as follows:
Drilling Program. We suspended our drilling program beginning in April 2020 through September 2020. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Production Curtailment. In April 2020, we shut-in production on selected wells for a period of several weeks extending through mid-May 2020.
Crude Oil Storage. We secured supplemental storage capacity for our crude oil production primarily on a month-to-month basis. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Derivatives. We substantially expanded the scope and range of our commodity derivatives portfolio during the early stages of the domestic COVID-19 health crisis. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $80.3 million in net cash proceeds from settlements, net of premiums, of our commodity derivatives. A portion of these proceeds were received in the second and third quarters of 2020 from contracts that were either restructured or put into place early in March and April of 2020.
Federal Relief. We utilized a number of liquidity and income tax measures made available under the CARES Act and related regulations, the most significant of which was the application for an accelerated refund of our remaining alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits of $2.5 million, which was received in June 2020, that would have otherwise been payable to us over the next two years.
Working Capital. We are continuing our increased diligence in collecting and managing our portfolio of joint venture receivables.
Cost Containment. We eliminated annual cost-of-living and similar adjustments to our salaries and wages for 2020, and in July 2020, we completed a limited RIF. We incurred and paid employee termination and severance benefits in connection with the limited RIF and those costs have been included in G&A. In addition, we implemented protocols and systems, designed to keep our employees safe and our operations at desired capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Commodity Hedging Program
As of February 25, 2021, we have hedged a portion of our estimated future crude oil, natural gas and ethane production through the first half of 2023. The following table, inclusive of January and February 2021 production months, summarizes our hedge positions for the periods presented:
Financial Condition
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides us with up to $1.0 billion in borrowing commitments. The current borrowing base under the Credit Facility is $375 million with availability further limited to a maximum of $350 million. As of March 5, 2021, we had $120.7 million of availability under the Credit Facility.
Our cash flows from operating activities are subject to significant volatility due to changes in commodity prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas products, as well as variations in our production. The prices for these commodities are driven by a number of factors beyond our control, including global and regional product supply and demand, weather, product distribution, refining and processing capacity and other supply chain dynamics, among other factors. All of these factors have been negatively impacted by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and the related instability in the global energy markets. In order to mitigate this volatility, we entered into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in the Credit Facility, hedging a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production through the end of 2023. The level of our hedging activity and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection, available hedge prices, the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy.
Capital Resources
Under our 2021 capital program, we anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to $240 million with approximately 98 percent of capital being directed to drilling and completions. We plan to fund our 2021 capital program and our operations for the next twelve months primarily with cash on hand, cash from operating activities, including net receipts from derivative settlements and, to the extent necessary, supplemental borrowings under the Credit Facility. Based upon current price and production expectations for 2021, we believe that our cash from operating activities and borrowings under our Credit Facility, as necessary, will be sufficient to fund our capital spending and operations for at least the next twelve months; however, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables and the length and magnitude of the current global economic slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and related instability in the global energy markets.
For a detailed analysis of our historical capital expenditures, see the “Cash Flows” discussion that follows.
Cash on Hand and Cash From Operating Activities. For additional information and an analysis of our historical cash flows from operating activities, see the “Cash Flows” discussion that follows.
Credit Facility Borrowings. During 2020, we repaid $48 million, net of borrowings, under the Credit Facility, including repayments of $10 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. We also repaid $80.5 million in January 2021 concurrent with the Ninth Amendment and an additional $5 million in February 2021. For additional information regarding the terms and covenants under the Credit Facility, see the “Capitalization” discussion that follows.
The following table summarizes our borrowing activity under the Credit Facility for the periods presented:
Proceeds from Sales of Assets. We continually evaluate potential sales of assets, including certain non-strategic oil and gas properties and undeveloped acreage, among others. For additional information and an analysis of our historical proceeds from sales of assets, see the “Cash Flows” discussion that follows.
Capital Markets Transactions. From time-to-time and under market conditions that we believe are favorable to us, we may consider capital market transactions, including the offering of debt and equity securities. We maintain an effective shelf registration statement to allow for optionality. As more fully described in Part I, Item 1. “Business,” the discussion of Key Developments previously and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” the Juniper Transaction resulted in the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Units in January 2021.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities. The decrease of $98.4 million in net cash from operating activities for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to the substantial decline in commodity prices resulting from the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and general instability in the global energy markets as well as the effect of 12 percent lower total sales volume, each of which substantially decreased our realized product revenues. In addition, in 2020 we incurred and paid costs for organizational restructuring activities, including severance benefits. These adverse impacts on cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by: (i) substantially higher receipts from our crude oil derivatives settlements, net of premiums during 2020, (ii) lower interest payments, net of interest rate swap settlements, due to substantially lower weighted-average variable rates despite higher outstanding borrowings in 2020, (iii) lower strategic transaction costs paid in 2020 as compared to similar costs paid in 2019, (v) the beneficial impact in 2020 of cost containment efforts in both our operations and administrative functions including lower discretionary maintenance, lower contract labor and cost deferrals consistent with lower levels of business activity, the elimination of cost-of-living and similar adjustments to our salaries and wages and reduced employee headcount and (vi) improved working capital management.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities. As illustrated in the tables below, our cash payments for capital expenditures were significantly lower during 2020 as compared to 2019, due primarily to the suspension of the drilling program for a substantial portion of 2020, partially offset by prepayments of $13.6 million in December 2020 for certain tubular and well materials and drilling and completion materials and services to lock in prices and secure discounts in advance of the program for the first quarter of 2021. The cash payments for capital expenditures for 2019 also reflect refunds of $3.8 million received for sales and use taxes that were applicable to capital expenditures in prior years. In 2019, we paid our joint working interest partners $6.5 million for the acquisition of working interests in certain properties for which we are the operator. In addition, we received insignificant proceeds from the sale of scrap tubular and well materials in both years.
The following table sets forth costs related to our capital expenditure program for the periods presented:
The following table reconciles the total costs of our capital expenditure program with the net cash paid for capital expenditures as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:
Cash Flows from Financing Activities. During 2020, we had borrowings of $51.0 million and made repayments of $99.0 million under the Credit Facility while 2019 included borrowings of $76.4 million and repayments of $35.0 million. The borrowings were utilized to fund a portion of our capital program in both years as well as the aforementioned acquisition of working interests in 2019. We also paid $0.1 million and $2.6 million of debt issue costs in 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with amendments to the Credit Facility.
Capitalization
The following table summarizes our total capitalization as of the dates presented:
Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $1.0 billion revolving commitment and a $375 million borrowing base including a $25 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Availability under the Credit Facility may not exceed the lesser of the aggregate commitments or the borrowing base; however, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility are limited to a maximum of $350 million until at least the next redetermination of the borrowing base. The borrowing base under the Credit Facility is redetermined semi-annually, generally in the Spring and Fall of each year. Additionally, we and the Credit Facility lenders may, upon request, initiate a redetermination at any time during the six-month period between scheduled redeterminations. Certain minimum hedging and other conditions included in the Ninth Amendment were initially satisfied in February 2021 which allow for a borrowing base holiday until Fall 2021 assuming we continue to satisfy the conditions. The Credit Facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature in May 2024. We had $0.4 million in letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a customary reference rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%, determined based on the utilization level under the Credit Facility or (b) a Eurodollar rate, including LIBOR through 2021, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.50%, determined based on the utilization level under the Credit Facility. Interest on reference rate borrowings is payable quarterly in arrears and is computed on the basis of a year of 365/366 days, and interest on Eurodollar borrowings is payable every one, three or six months, at the election of the borrower, and is computed on the basis of a year of 360 days. As of December 31, 2020, the actual weighted-average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 3.40%. Unused commitment fees are charged at a rate of 0.50%.
The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Partnership and all of its subsidiaries (excluding the borrower subsidiary), or the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The guarantees under the Credit Facility are full and unconditional and joint and several. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by the Guarantor Subsidiaries. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the borrower or of any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to obtain funds through dividends, advances or loans. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our subsidiaries’ assets.
Second Lien Facility. In accordance with the Second Lien Amendment, the maturity date of the Second Lien Facility was extended to September 29, 2024.
The Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments of $1.875 million and outstanding borrowings under the Second Lien Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a customary reference rate based on the prime rate plus an applicable margin of 8.25% or (b) a Eurodollar rate, including LIBOR through 2021, with a floor of 1.00%, plus an applicable margin of 7.25%; provided that the applicable margin will increase to 9.25% and 8.25%, respectively, during any quarter in which the quarterly amortization payment is not made. As of December 31, 2020, the actual interest rate of outstanding borrowings under the Second Lien Facility was 8.00%. Interest on reference rate borrowings is payable quarterly in arrears and is computed on the basis of a year of 365/366 days, and interest on Eurodollar borrowings is payable every one or three months (including in three month intervals if we select a six-month interest period), at our election and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. We have the right, to the extent permitted under the Credit Facility and an intercreditor agreement between the lenders under the Credit Facility and the lenders under the Second Lien Facility, to prepay loans under the Second Lien Facility at any time, subject to the following prepayment premiums (in addition to customary “breakage” costs with respect to Eurodollar loans): from January 15, 2021 through January 14, 2022, 102% of the amount being prepaid, from January 15, 2022 through January 14, 2023, 101% of the amount being prepaid; and thereafter, no premium. The Second Lien Facility also provides for the following prepayment premiums in the event of a change in control that results in an offer of prepayment that is accepted by the lenders under the Second Lien Facility: from January 15, 2021 through January 14, 2023, 102% of the amount being prepaid, from January 15, 2023 through January 14, 2024, 101% of the amount being prepaid; and thereafter, no premium.
The Second Lien Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our subsidiaries’ assets with lien priority subordinated to the liens securing the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Second Lien Facility are guaranteed by the Partnership and the Guarantor Subsidiaries.
Covenant Compliance. The Credit Facility requires us to maintain (1) a minimum current ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility, which considers the unused portion of the total commitment as a current asset) of 1.00 to 1.00, (2) a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated indebtedness to EBITDAX, each as defined in the Credit Facility), in each case measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of 3.50 to 1.00. and (3) a maximum first lien leverage ratio (consolidated secured indebtedness to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses, both as defined in the Credit Facility), measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of 2.50 to 1.00.
The Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility also contain affirmative and negative covenants, including as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws, ERISA and anti-corruption laws), maintenance of required insurance, delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements, oil and gas engineering reports and budgets, maintenance and operation of property (including oil and gas properties), limitations on capital expenditures, investments, the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, merger, consolidation or sale of assets, payment of dividends, and transactions with affiliates and other customary covenants. In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain anti-cash hoarding provisions, including the requirement to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit on a weekly basis in the amount of any cash on the balance sheet (subject to certain exceptions) in excess of $25 million.
The Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility contain customary events of default and remedies. If we do not comply with the financial and other covenants in the Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility, as applicable, the lenders thereto may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility.
Results of Operations
Presentation of Financial Information and Changes in Accounting Principles
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
As discussed in further detail in Notes 2, 5 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” we have adopted two accounting standards that impact the comparability of our financial statements: Financial Accounting Standards Board’s, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13, effective January 1, 2020 and ASC Topic 842, Leases, or ASC Topic 842, effective January 1, 2019. We adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the optional cumulative effect transition approach. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, certain amounts included in the caption Other revenues, net are not comparable between the 2020 and 2019 presentations; however, we do not believe that such differences are material. The adoption of ASC Topic 842 impacts the presentation and comparability of (i) Lease operating, or LOE, expense and (ii) General and administrative, or G&A, expenses. We adopted ASC Topic 842 utilizing the cumulative effect transition method effective January 1, 2019. Accordingly, our LOE and G&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are not comparable to the 2018 presentation of these items. Our discussion and analysis of these items in the Results of Operations that follow address the effects of changes directly attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and ASC Topic 842.
Sales Volume
The following tables set forth a summary of our total and average daily sales volumes by product and geographic region for the periods presented:
_____________________________________________
1 All volumetric statistics presented represent volumes of commodity production that were actually sold during the year ended December 31, 2020 as presented. Volumes of crude oil physically produced in excess of volumes sold are placed in temporary storage to be sold in subsequent periods.
2 Mid-Continent operations were sold on July 31, 2018.
2020 vs. 2019. Total sales volume decreased 12 percent during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to fewer wells turned to sales in 2020 primarily as a result of the temporary suspension of our 2020 drilling program shortly after the magnitude of the global economic downturn associated with COVID-19 pandemic became evident. While overall sales volume was lower in 2020, crude oil sales volume decreased by only eight percent compared to 2019 due to a shift in development focus that began in the second half of 2019 to the oilier north and eastern portions of our acreage holdings. While both years experienced natural production declines, the effect in 2020 was more significant with the completion of fewer new wells in 2020.
Prior to the temporary suspension in April, we operated three drilling rigs and resumed drilling with one rig beginning in October 2020 and with a second rig in mid-November 2020. This compared to up to three rigs operating consistently during the majority of 2019. During 2020, we turned 23 gross (20.6 net) wells to sales compared to 48 gross (43.3 net) wells during 2019.
Approximately 77 percent of total sales volume during 2020 was attributable to crude oil compared to approximately 74 percent during 2019. The increase in the crude oil composition of total sales volume was due primarily to the aforementioned shift in development plans that began in the second half of 2019 with less emphasis in the southeastern portion of our acreage holdings which have historically higher gas content.
2019 vs. 2018. Total sales volume increased 27 percent during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a greater number of higher working interest wells turned to sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 through December 31, 2019 when compared to the corresponding periods from the fourth quarter of 2017 through December 31, 2018 as well as the effect of a full year of production from the Hunt Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the divestiture in July 2018 of our former Mid-Continent operations, as well as natural production declines from our more mature Eagle Ford wells.
We operated two drilling rigs during the majority of 2019 compared to three during the majority of 2018. During 2019, we turned 48 gross (43.3 net) wells to sales compared to 53 gross (45.5 net) wells during 2018. When considering the wells turned to sales in the fourth quarters of the prior years for which we would receive a full year of subsequent production, we had 58 gross (52.2 net) wells for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 62 gross (50.8 net) wells for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Approximately 74 percent of total sales volume during 2019 was attributable to crude oil when compared to approximately 76 percent during 2018. The decline in the crude oil composition of total sales volume was due primarily to a higher gas content experienced with certain wells, primarily in the southeastern portion of our acreage holdings.
Product Revenues and Prices
The following tables set forth a summary of our revenues and prices per unit of volume by product and geographic region for the periods presented:
_____________________________________________
1 Mid-Continent operations were sold on July 31, 2018.
The following table provides an analysis of the changes in our revenues for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. Our product revenues decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to 37 percent lower crude oil prices and eight percent lower volume, respectively. NGL revenues declined in 2020 due to 31 percent lower prices and 22 percent lower volume. Lower natural gas revenues were attributable to 25 percent lower pricing and 24 percent lower volume in 2020. Total crude oil revenues were approximately 93 percent of our total product revenues during each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
2019 vs. 2018. Our product revenues increased seven percent during 2019 over 2018 due primarily to approximately 23 percent higher crude oil volumes partially offset by 12 percent lower crude oil pricing resulting in higher overall product revenues. NGL revenues declined approximately 21 percent in 2019 due to substantially lower pricing (47 percent) partially offset by approximately 49 percent higher volumes. Natural gas revenues increased approximately 11 percent due primarily to approximately 36 percent higher volumes substantially offset by approximately 19 percent lower pricing. Crude oil revenues were approximately 93 percent of our total revenues during 2019 as compared to approximately 92 percent during 2018.
Realized Differentials
The following table reconciles our realized price differentials from weighted-average NYMEX-quoted prices for WTI crude oil for the periods presented:
The adverse impact of COVID-19 and instability in the global energy markets exacerbated a declining trend in realized prices that effectively eliminated a premium margin to the NYMEX WTI index price for crude oil in 2020 compared to 2019. Historically, we had realized premiums to NYMEX WTI index pricing as a substantial portion of our crude oil volume was sold based on Light Louisiana Sweet, or LLS, or Magellan East Houston, or MEH, pricing. During 2020, we did not have any crude oil sales based on the LLS index.
Effects of Derivatives
The following table reconciles crude oil revenues to realized prices, as adjusted for realized derivative settlements, for the periods presented:
Gain (Loss) on Sales of Assets
We recognize gains and losses on the sale or disposition of assets other than our oil and gas properties upon the completion of the underlying transactions. The following table sets forth the total net gains and losses recognized for the periods presented:
2020, 2019 and 2018. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized insignificant net gains and losses attributable to the sale or trade of certain support equipment and surplus and scrap tubular inventory and well materials.
Other Revenues, Net
Other revenues, net, includes fees for marketing and water disposal services that we charge to third parties, net of related expenses, as well as other miscellaneous revenues and credits attributable to our current operations. In addition, charges attributable to credit losses associated with our trade and joint venture partner receivables are included in this caption as a contra-revenue item.
The following table sets forth the total other revenues, net recognized for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. Other revenues, net increased during 2020 from 2019 due primarily to higher water disposal revenues, net of related expenses. The higher water disposal-related net revenues during 2020 is due primarily to $0.8 million of certain unscheduled workover repairs and maintenance costs incurred during the second quarter of 2019 at our water disposal facilities. The overall increase in other revenues, net was partially offset by a decline in marketing fees in 2020 due primarily to lower overall sales volume, commodity prices and related marketing activities. Furthermore, the 2020 period includes credit loss charges of $0.1 million determined in accordance with ASU 2016-13 that are substantially greater in amount and were not comparable to similar charges incurred in 2019 under prior GAAP.
2019 vs. 2018. Other revenues, net increased during 2019 from 2018 due primarily to higher water disposal revenues attributable to higher production partially offset by the aforementioned unscheduled repairs and maintenance costs incurred during the second quarter of 2019 at our water disposal facilities.
Lease Operating Expenses
LOE include costs that we incur to operate our producing wells and field operations. The most significant costs include compression and gas-lift, chemicals, water disposal, repairs and maintenance, including down-hole repairs, field labor, pumping and well-tending, equipment rentals, utilities and supplies among others.
The following table sets forth our LOE for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. LOE decreased on an absolute and per unit basis during 2020 when compared to 2019. The absolute decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume in 2020 primarily resulting in lower overall variable costs including compression, chemicals, labor, utilities as well as substantially lower repairs and maintenance costs. Despite the decrease in sales volume, our per unit rates experienced a marginal decrease as our fixed cost burden has declined from 2019. In addition, we experienced an overall higher level of efficiency attributable to a combination of cost-containment efforts and the application of operational improvements. These broad reductions were partially offset by higher water disposal costs associated with protective measures from offset stimulation activities during 2020.
2019 vs. 2018. LOE increased on an absolute basis, but declined on a per unit basis during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to the overall effect of 27 percent higher production volume during 2019. The volume-based absolute increases were primarily attributable to compression and gas lift, water disposal, utilities and environmental costs for a combined effect of $5.6 million. Higher maintenance costs of $1.3 million were incurred in 2019. In addition, 2019 includes the effects of two additional months of production attributable to the Hunt Acquisition.
Gathering Processing and Transportation
GPT expense includes costs that we incur to gather and aggregate our crude oil, NGL and natural gas production from our wells and deliver them via pipeline or truck to a central delivery point, downstream pipelines or processing plants, and blend or process, as necessary, depending upon the type of production and the specific contractual arrangements that we have with the applicable midstream operators. In addition, GPT expense includes short-term rental charges for crude oil storage tanks.
The following table sets forth our GPT for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. While GPT expense declined on an absolute basis during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to lower sales volumes, we did experience an increase on a per unit basis during 2020 due primarily to a scheduled rate increase that became effective August 1, 2019, for crude oil gathering services. Accordingly, the higher rates for gathering services were in effect for the entirety of 2020 as compared to only five months during 2019. The absolute decline in GPT expense was partially offset by short-term rental charges that we incurred in 2020 to temporarily store a portion of our crude oil production as well as a shift in the mix of crude oil production sold at a central delivery point and pipeline from that sold at the wellhead which incurs no corresponding GPT expense subsequent to the achievement of required minimum crude oil volumes transported by pipeline.
2019 vs. 2018. GPT expense increased on an absolute basis during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to substantially higher production volumes. Per unit costs declined marginally in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a shift in the mix of crude oil production sold at the wellhead with no corresponding GPT expense partially offset by a scheduled rate increase effective August 1, 2019 discussed above.
Production and Ad Valorem Taxes
Production or severance taxes represent taxes imposed by the states in which we operate for the removal of resources including crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Ad valorem taxes represent taxes imposed by certain jurisdictions, primarily counties, in which we operate, based on the assessed value of our operating properties. The assessments for ad valorem taxes are generally based on contemporary commodity prices.
The following table sets forth our production and ad valorem taxes for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. Production taxes decreased on an absolute basis and per unit basis during 2020 when compared to 2019 due primarily to decreases in aggregate commodity sales prices of 34 percent in 2020. In addition, we were able to reclassify certain wells with regulatory certification from crude oil to high cost gas which has resulted in severance tax savings in the second half of 2020. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we decreased the accruals for ad valorem taxes based on our most recent estimates for assessments which reflects the recent substantial decline in commodity prices. During the second half of 2019, we increased our ad valorem accruals due to higher commodity-price based valuation assessments experienced in the 2018 and 2019 annual assessment periods, which were reflective of indicative prices published for 2019, and the effects of growing our assessable property base and increased working interests from acquisition activity.
2019 vs. 2018. Production taxes increased on an absolute basis, but declined on a per unit basis during 2019 when compared to 2018 due primarily to increased production volume despite lower overall commodity sales prices. Accruals for ad valorem taxes also increased substantially for the 2019 periods due to a higher commodity-price based valuation assumption and the effects of growing our assessable property base and increased working interests from acquisition activity.
General and Administrative
Our G&A expenses include employee compensation, benefits and other related costs for our corporate management and governance functions, rent and occupancy costs for our corporate facilities, insurance, and professional fees and consulting costs supporting various corporate-level functions, among others. In order to facilitate a meaningful discussion and analysis of our results of operations with respect to G&A expenses, we have disaggregated certain costs into three components as presented in the table below. Primary G&A encompasses all G&A costs except share-based compensation and certain significant special charges that are generally attributable to material stand-alone transactions or corporate actions that are not otherwise in the normal course.
The following table sets forth the components of G&A expenses for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. Our primary G&A expenses increased on an absolute and per unit basis during 2020 compared to 2019. The absolute increase is due primarily to a lower level of capitalized labor attributable to the suspension of our drilling program from April through October 2020. In addition, we incurred higher information technology support, occupancy and consulting costs and professional fees in 2020. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals and the absence of cost-of-living and similar adjustments to salaries and wages in 2020. The increase in per unit costs was exacerbated by the effect of lower overall production volume during 2020.
Share-based compensation charges during the periods presented are attributable to the amortization of compensation cost, net of forfeitures, associated with the grants of time-vested restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance-based restricted stock units, or PRSUs. The grants of RSUs and PRSUs are described in greater detail in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” A substantial portion of the share-based compensation expense is attributable to the RSU and PRSU grants made in the normal course in March of 2020 and January of 2017. The remainder is attributable to grants of RSUs and PRSUs to certain employees upon their hiring or as a result of promotion during the periods presented. All of our share-based compensation represents non-cash expenses.
In connection with the appointment of our new CEO and the related executive transition, we incurred certain incremental G&A costs. In July 2020, we also initiated a limited reduction-in-force, or RIF, action resulting in the payment of employee termination and severance benefits. Collectively, we have characterized these costs broadly as an organizational restructuring for which we incurred approximately $1.4 million of costs.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and through the end of the year, we incurred certain professional fees and consulting costs of approximately $5.0 million in connection with the Juniper Transaction as described in greater detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”. During the first half of 2019, we incurred consulting and other costs, including legal and other professional fees, primarily associated with a merger transaction which was mutually terminated by us and the counterparty in March 2019.
2019 vs. 2018. Our primary G&A expenses increased on an absolute basis and decreased on a per unit basis during 2019 compared to 2018. The absolute increases are due primarily to the effects of higher payroll, benefits and support costs attributable to a higher overall employee headcount. In addition, we incurred higher occupancy costs and higher consulting and related costs including those associated with a senior management transition in the second half of 2019. Higher production volume had the effect of reducing G&A per unit of production during 2019.
We incurred consulting and other costs in the second half of 2018 which continued into the first quarter of 2019 associated with the previously terminated merger transaction. In addition to these costs, we incurred transaction costs in 2018 associated with the Mid-Continent divestiture and the Hunt Acquisition, including legal, due diligence and other professional fees. We also paid certain costs attributable to the retirement of our former Executive Chairman in February 2018.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
DD&A expense includes charges for the allocation of property costs based on the volume of production, depreciation of fixed assets other than oil and gas assets as well as the accretion of our ARO liabilities. The following table sets forth total and per unit costs for DD&A for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. DD&A decreased on an absolute and a per unit basis during 2020 when compared to 2019. Lower production volume provided for decreases of approximately $21.3 million while $12.6 million was attributable to the lower DD&A rates in 2020. The lower DD&A rate in 2020 was primarily attributable to the effect of adding additional reserves in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the impairments recorded in 2020 as referenced and discussed further below.
2019 vs. 2018. DD&A increased on an absolute and per unit basis during 2019 when compared to 2018. Higher production volume provided for an increase of approximately $35.1 million while $11.5 million was attributable to the higher DD&A rates in 2019. The higher DD&A rates in 2019 are attributable to higher finding and development costs per unit of reserves added to the full cost pool.
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties
We assess our oil and gas properties on a quarterly basis based on the results of a Ceiling Test in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties.
2020. During 2020 we recorded impairments of our oil and gas properties as a result of a decline in the twelve-month average prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas as indicated by our Ceiling Test under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. While current commodity prices have recovered somewhat, it is nonetheless possible that we will experience an additional impairment in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties during the first quarter of 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense includes charges for outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility, derived from internationally-recognized interest rates with a premium based on our credit profile and the level of credit outstanding. In addition, we are assessed certain fees for the overall credit commitments provided to us as well as fees for credit utilization and letters of credit. Also included is the accretion of original issue discount on the Second Lien Facility and the amortization of issuance costs capitalized attributable to the Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility. These costs are partially offset by interest amounts that we capitalize on unproved property costs while we are engaged in the evaluation of projects for the underlying acreage.
The following table summarizes the components of our interest expense for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. Interest expense decreased during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to the effect of lower interest rates partially offset by higher outstanding balances under the Credit Facility during 2020. The weighted-average balances under the Credit Facility were higher in 2020 compared to 2019 period by approximately $4 million. The weighted-average interest rates were lower during the same period by 124 basis points. The accretion of original issue discount, or OID, is entirely attributable to the Second Lien Facility and the amortization of debt issuance costs includes amounts attributable to both the Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility. We wrote off approximately $1 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility in the first half of 2020 commensurate with the reduction in the borrowing base. We capitalized a smaller portion of interest during 2020 as we maintained a smaller portion of unproved property as compared to 2019.
2019 vs. 2018. Interest expense increased during 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to higher outstanding balances under the Credit Facility partially offset by the effect of lower interest rates. Weighted-average balances under the Credit Facility were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 by approximately $119 million while the weighted-average interest rates were lower during the same period by 97 basis points. The accretion of OID is entirely attributable to the Second Lien Facility and the amortization of debt issuance costs includes amounts attributable to both the Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility. We capitalized a smaller portion of interest during 2019 as we maintained a substantially smaller portion of unproved property as compared to 2018.
Derivatives
The gains and losses for our derivatives portfolio reflect changes in the fair value attributable to changes in market values relative to our hedged commodity prices and variable interest rates.
The following table summarizes the gains and (losses) attributable to our commodity derivatives portfolio and interest rate swaps for the periods presented:
2020 vs. 2019. In 2020, commodity prices collapsed dramatically compared to 2019 due primarily to the economic slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruptions in the global energy markets. Accordingly, we substantially expanded our commodity hedging program and actively added hedge contracts that allowed us to benefit from falling prices primarily in the first half of 2020. A substantial portion of our net commodity derivative gains in 2020 were realized and were supplemented to a lesser extent by net mark-to-market gains attributable to open positions. By contrast, we had substantial net unrealized mark-to-market losses in 2019 as crude oil prices increased by year-end 2019 relative to our hedged positions. Realized settlements receipts for crude oil and natural gas derivatives were $93.4 million during 2020 as compared to the realized settlement payments for crude oil of $10.5 million in 2019.
In 2020, we began hedging a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility. During 2020, we paid $2.2 million of net settlements from our interest rate swaps as the benchmark rate declined relative to our weighted-average hedged rate and we recognized mark-to-market losses as well.
2019 vs. 2018. In 2019, the forward curve for crude oil prices increased relative to our weighted-average hedged prices resulting in net losses for our crude oil derivative portfolio. We paid net cash settlements of $4.1 million and $48.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Other, Net
Other, net includes interest income, non-service costs associated with our retiree benefit plans and miscellaneous items of income and expense that are not directly associated with our current operations, including certain recoveries and write-offs attributable to prior years and properties that have been divested.
The following table sets forth the other income (expense), net recognized for the periods presented:
2020. Other, net income (expense) decreased during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to certain costs that were incurred in 2020 that were attributable to previously divested properties that were otherwise not recoverable from the buyers of those properties.
2019. Other, net income (expense) decreased during 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to the write-off in 2019 of $0.2 million attributable to acquisition transactions in prior years that were no longer deemed recoverable. This charge was partially offset in 2019 by recoveries of sales and use taxes attributable to previously divested properties.
2018. In 2018, we received a recovery of $1.5 million from partners attributable to a prior-year acquisition and received recoveries of $0.3 million of joint interest receivable balances previously written-off in connection with the bankruptcy of a former partner. We also received severance tax refunds attributable to previously-divested properties in excess of recorded amounts, interest income earned on an escrow account attributable to a previous acquisition as well as recording the reversal of a litigation reserve attributable to previously-divested properties. The combined benefit to income from these items was approximately $0.7 million. These amounts were partially offset by interest charges applicable to a settlement with a royalty owner and charges associated with our retiree benefit plans.
Reorganization Items, Net
The following table summarizes the components included in “Reorganization items, net” for the periods presented:
2018. While we emerged from bankruptcy in September 2016, certain administrative and claims resolution activities continued until November 2018 when the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree which effectively closed the case. Upon the closure, we reversed the remaining $0.2 million unused portion of an accrual that was established upon emergence from bankruptcy for legal and professional fees and administrative costs. In addition, we reversed the $2.7 million unallocated portion of a reserve that was established upon emergence for the potential settlement of certain claims in cash. Finally, we also reversed $0.4 million of accounts payable that were held open since the date of emergence as secured claims, but were ultimately expunged. As these items of income are directly attributable to the final administration of our bankruptcy case and not a part of our continuing operations, they are classified on our Consolidated Statement of Operations as components of “Reorganization items, net.”
Income Taxes
The following table summarizes our income tax provision for the periods presented:
2020. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes current federal benefits of $1.2 million attributable to refundable alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits for the 2020 tax year, which when combined with the amounts attributable to 2019 that had been recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 as a current asset, were received in 2020 as an acceleration of all AMT credits in connection with certain provisions of the CARES Act. This AMT benefit was offset by a corresponding decrease in the deferred tax asset associated with AMT credit carryforwards giving rise to deferred federal expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we have recognized a deferred state tax expense of $2.7 million attributable to property and equipment and $0.4 million of current state expense attributable to the Texas margin tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 for an overall effective tax rate of 0.7%.
2019. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes current federal benefits of $1.2 million attributable to the anticipated refund of AMT credits for the 2019 tax year. The amount for 2019 was recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 as a current asset. These benefits have been offset by corresponding decreases in the deferred tax asset associated with AMT credit carryforwards giving rise to deferred federal expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we have recognized a deferred state tax expense of $2.1 million attributable to property and equipment for an overall effective tax rate of 3.0%.
2018. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a current federal benefit of $2.5 million attributable to the anticipated refund of AMT credits for the 2018 tax year. The $2.5 million attributable to 2018 was refunded to us in 2019. This benefit is offset by a corresponding decrease in the deferred tax asset associated with the refundable AMT credit giving rise to a deferred federal expense. In addition, we have recognized a deferred state tax expense of $0.5 million for an overall effective tax rate of 0.2%.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2020, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into included information technology licensing, service agreements and letters of credit, all of which are customary in our business. See “Contractual Obligations” summarized below and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more details related to the value of our off-balance sheet arrangements. We did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise had we engaged in such relationships.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
_____________________________________________
1 Assumes that the amount outstanding of $314.4 million as of December 31, 2020 will remain outstanding until its maturity in 2024. The Credit Facility has been classified as a long term liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as described in “Financial Condition - Liquidity” and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
2 Assumes that the amount outstanding of $200 million as of December 31, 2020 will remain outstanding until its original maturity in 2022 (without giving effect to the extension of its maturity in connection with Second Lien Amendment that became effective in January 2021). The Second Lien Facility has been classified as a long term liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as described in “Financial Condition - Liquidity” and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
3 Represents estimated interest payments that will be due under the Credit Facility and Second Lien Facility, assuming that the underlying LIBOR-based interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020 remain in effect and the amounts outstanding of $314.4 million and $200 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively, will remain outstanding until their maturities in 2024 and 2022, respectively.
4 Relates primarily to office facilities and equipment leases as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
5 Represents minimum payments for gathering and intermediate pipeline transportation services for our crude oil and condensate production in South Texas. The gathering portion of these commitments is recognized as GPT while the intermediate transportation and pipeline support components are recognized as a reduction to the index-based price that we receive from crude oil sold to Nuevo Dos Marketing, LLC.
6 Represents the undiscounted balance payable, primarily for the plugging of inactive wells, in periods more than five years in the future for which $5.5 million, on a discounted basis, has been recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and illustrated in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” While we may make payments to settle certain AROs, including those subject to regulatory requirements during each of the next five years, no material amounts are currently required by contract or regulatory authority to be made during this time frame.
7 Represents all other significant obligations including information technology licensing and service agreements, among others as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Critical Accounting Estimates
The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. We consider the following to be the most critical accounting estimates requiring judgment of our management.
Oil and Gas Reserves
Estimates of our oil and gas reserves are the most critical estimate included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Reserve estimates become the basis for determining depletive write-off rates and the recoverability of historical cost investments. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserve quantities, including projecting the total quantities in place, future production rates and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. In addition, reserve estimates of new discoveries are less precise than those of producing properties due to the lack of a production history. Accordingly, these estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
There are several factors which could change the estimates of our oil and gas reserves. Significant rises or declines in commodity product prices as well as changes in our drilling plans could lead to changes in the amount of reserves as production activities become more or less economical. An additional factor that could result in a change of recorded reserves is the reservoir decline rates differing from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond our control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
Oil and Gas Properties
We apply the full cost method to account for our oil and gas properties. Under this method, all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs may be incurred both prior to and after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions, geological and geophysical, or seismic, drilling, completion and equipment costs. Internal costs incurred that are directly attributable to exploration, development and acquisition activities undertaken by us for our own account, and which are not attributable to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities are also capitalized. Future development costs are estimated on a property-by-property basis based on current economic conditions and are amortized as a component of DD&A.
Unproved properties not being amortized include unevaluated leasehold costs and associated capitalized interest. These costs are reviewed quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to a property or if an impairment has occurred due to lease expirations, general economic conditions and other factors, in which case, the related costs along with associated capitalized interest are reclassified to the proved oil and gas properties subject to DD&A. Factors we consider in our assessment include drilling results, the terms of oil and gas leases not held by production and drilling and completion capital expenditures consistent with our plans.
At the end of each quarterly reporting period, the unamortized cost of our oil and gas properties, net of deferred income taxes, is limited to the sum of the estimated after-tax discounted future net revenues from proved properties adjusted for costs excluded from amortization and related income taxes, or a Ceiling Test. The estimated after-tax discounted future net revenues are determined using the prior 12-month’s average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month, adjusted for differentials, discounted at 10%. The calculation of the Ceiling Test and provision for DD&A are based on estimates of proved reserves. There are significant uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production, timing and plan of development. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties exceeded the limit determined by the Ceiling Test by $120.3 million which resulted in our recording an impairment charge for the three months then ended and a total of $391.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Because the Ceiling Test utilizes commodity prices based on a trailing twelve month average, it does not fully reflect the substantial decline in commodity prices that accelerated early in the second quarter of 2020 due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing disruption in global energy markets. While current commodity prices have recovered somewhat, it is nonetheless possible that we will experience an additional impairment in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties during the first quarter of 2021.
Derivative Activities
We utilize derivative instruments, typically swaps, put options and call options which are placed with financial institutions that we believe are acceptable credit risks, to mitigate our financial exposure to commodity price volatility associated with anticipated sales of our future production and volatility in interest rates attributable to our variable rate debt instruments. All derivative instruments are recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements at fair value with the changes recorded currently in earnings. We determine the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments using industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, implied volatilities, time value and non-performance risk. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy, which has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized after consideration of expected future taxable income and reasonable tax planning strategies. In the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a part of our deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had not been established, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be reflected in income in the period such determination is made. The most significant matter applicable to the realization of our deferred tax assets is attributable to net operating losses at the federal level as well as certain states in which we operate. Estimates of future taxable income inherently reflect a significant degree of uncertainty. As of December 31, 2020, we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of our gross deferred tax assets and, accordingly, have maintained a full valuation allowance.
