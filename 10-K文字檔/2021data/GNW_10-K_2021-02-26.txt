Overview
Our business
We are dedicated to helping meet the homeownership and long-term care needs of our customers. We are headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. We facilitate homeownership in the United States and internationally by providing mortgage insurance products that allow people to purchase homes with low down payments while protecting lenders against the risk of default. Through our homeownership education and assistance programs, we also help people keep their homes when they experience financial difficulties. We offer long-term care insurance products as well as service traditional life insurance and fixed annuity products. We have the following four operating business segments: U.S. Mortgage Insurance; Australia Mortgage Insurance; U.S. Life Insurance; and Runoff. We also have Corporate and Other activities.
Our financial information
The financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
has been derived from our consolidated financial statements.
Revenues and expenses
Our revenues consist primarily of the following:
•
U.S. Mortgage Insurance
.
The revenues in our U.S. Mortgage Insurance segment consist primarily of:
•
net premiums earned on U.S. mortgage insurance policies;
•
net investment income and net investment gains (losses) on the segment’s separate investment portfolio; and
•
fee revenues from contract underwriting services.
•
Australia Mortgage Insurance
.
The revenues in our Australia Mortgage Insurance segment consist primarily of:
•
net premiums earned on Australia mortgage insurance policies; and
•
net investment income and net investment gains (losses) on the segment’s separate investment portfolio.
•
U.S. Life Insurance
.
The revenues in our U.S. Life Insurance segment consist primarily of:
•
net premiums earned on individual and group long-term care insurance, individual term life insurance and single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies;
•
net investment income and net investment gains (losses) on the segment’s separate investment portfolios; and
•
policy fees and other income, including surrender charges, mortality and expense risk charges, and other administrative charges.
•
Runoff
.
The revenues in our Runoff segment consist primarily of:
•
net investment income and net investment gains (losses) on the segment’s separate investment portfolios; and
•
policy fees and other income, including mortality and expense risk charges, primarily from variable annuity contracts, and other administrative charges.
•
Corporate and Other
.
The revenues in Corporate and Other activities consist primarily of:
•
net premiums earned primarily on mortgage insurance policies in certain smaller international mortgage insurance businesses;
•
unallocated net investment income and net investment gains (losses); and
•
policy fees and other income from other businesses that are managed outside of our operating segments and eliminations of inter-segment transactions.
Our expenses consist primarily of the following:
•
benefits provided to policyholders and contractholders and changes in reserves;
•
interest credited on general account balances;
•
acquisition and operating expenses, including commissions, marketing expenses, legal expenses, policy and contract servicing costs, overhead and other general expenses that are not capitalized (shown net of deferrals);
•
amortization of DAC and other intangible assets;
•
interest and other financing expenses; and
•
income taxes.
We allocate corporate expenses to each of our operating segments using various methodologies, including based on the amount of capital allocated to each operating segment.
We tax our international businesses at their local jurisdictional tax rates and our domestic businesses at the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate of 21%. Our segment tax methodology applies the respective jurisdictional or domestic tax rate to the pre-tax
income (loss) of each segment, which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign withholding taxes and permanent differences between U.S. GAAP and local tax law. The difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in Corporate and Other activities.
The effective tax rates disclosed herein are calculated using whole dollars. As a result, the percentages shown may differ from an effective tax rate calculated using rounded numbers.
Executive Summary of Financial Results
Below is an executive summary of our consolidated financial results for the periods indicated. Amounts below are net of taxes, unless otherwise indicated.
2020 compared to 2019
•
We had net income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders of $178 million and $343 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Adjusted operating income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders was $317 million and $420 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•
Our U.S. Mortgage Insurance segment had adjusted operating income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders of $381 million and $568 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher losses largely from new delinquencies driven in large part by a significant increase in borrower forbearance as a result of COVID-19,
reserve strengthening of $51 million on existing delinquencies and from lower net benefits from cures and aging of existing delinquencies in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher premiums largely driven by higher insurance in-force
and an increase in policy cancellations in our single premium mortgage insurance product primarily due to higher mortgage refinancing in 2020. The year ended December 31, 2019 included favorable reserve adjustments of $18 million mostly associated with lower expected claim rates and a favorable adjustment of $11 million related to our single premium earnings pattern review.
•
Our Australia Mortgage Insurance segment had adjusted operating income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders of $1 million and $51 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was primarily from loss reserve strengthening of $91 million driven by a refinement in methodology and anticipated claims outcomes due to the economic impacts caused by COVID-19,
including incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves on loans in payment deferral programs. The decrease was also attributable to lower earned premiums largely from portfolio seasoning and lower policy cancellations and lower net investment income in 2020.
•
Our U.S. Life Insurance segment had adjusted operating income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders of $68 million in 2020 compared to an adjusted operating loss of $55 million in 2019.
•
Adjusted operating income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders in our long-term care insurance business increased $180 million primarily from an increase in claim terminations driven mostly by higher mortality as well as favorable development on IBNR claims and higher investment income in 2020. We also increased reserves by $157 million in 2020 to account for changes to incidence and mortality experience driven by COVID-19,
which we believe are temporary.
•
The adjusted operating loss available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders in our life insurance business increased $66 million predominantly attributable to higher reserves in our 10-year
term universal life insurance block as it entered its post-level premium period during the premium grace period, higher mortality in 2020 compared to 2019, higher lapses primarily associated with our large 20-year
term life insurance block as it entered its post-level premium period and a DAC impairment of $50 million in 2020. The higher loss was partially offset by a favorable unlocking of $60 million in our term universal and universal life insurance products as part of our annual review of assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to unfavorable unlocking of $107 million in 2019 (see “-Critical Accounting Estimates” for additional information).
•
Adjusted operating income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders in our fixed annuities business increased $9 million predominantly from $39 million of unfavorable charges related to loss recognition testing in 2019 that did not recur (see “-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits” for additional information) and lower interest credited due to block runoff, partially offset by lower net spreads in 2020.
•
Our Runoff segment had adjusted operating income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders of $43 million and $56 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was predominantly due to less favorable equity market performance, an unfavorable assumption update of $5 million and a decline in interest rates, partially offset by higher net spreads in 2020.
•
Corporate and Other Activities had an adjusted operating loss available to Genworth Financial, Inc.’s common stockholders of $176 million and $200 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease
in the loss was primarily related to lower interest expense and lower operating costs, partially offset by a lower benefit for income taxes in 2020.
Significant Developments
The periods under review include, among others, the following significant developments.
U.S. Mortgage Insurance
•
COVID-19
and CARES Act.
The United States economy and consumer confidence improved in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2020 as state economies reopened in varying degrees; however, certain geographies and industries have experienced slower recoveries because of COVID-19,
the mitigation steps taken to control its spread or changed consumer behavior. The unemployment rate was elevated at 6.7% in December 2020, compared to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5% in February 2020 but has decreased from a peak of 14.8% in April 2020. Specific to housing finance, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to provide up to 180 days of deferred or reduced payments (which can be extended for up to an additional 180 days), commonly referred to as “forbearance,” for borrowers with a federally backed mortgage loan who assert they have experienced a financial hardship related to COVID-19.
Since the introduction of the CARES Act, the GSEs as well as most servicers of non-federally
backed mortgage loans have extended similar relief to their respective portfolios of loans. The FHFA extended the foreclosure moratorium until March 31, 2021 for mortgages that are purchased by the GSEs.
•
Borrower forbearance.
Forbearance periods can vary but generally may be extended up to 15 months or shortened at the request of the borrower. In February 2021, the FHFA issued guidance for loans in an active COVID-19
forbearance plan. For those loans in a forbearance plan as of February 28, 2021, the servicer is authorized to grant an eligible borrower an extension of up to three additional months, provided the plan term does not exceed 15 months of total delinquency or a cumulative term of 15 months, whichever is shorter. Approximately 82% of our primary new delinquencies between the second and fourth quarters of 2020 were subject to a forbearance plan as compared to less than 5% in recent pre-COVID-19
quarters. Servicer reported forbearance slowed meaningfully beginning in June 2020 and ended the fourth quarter of 2020 with approximately 5.4% or 50,018 of our active primary policies reported in a forbearance plan, of which approximately 63% were reported as delinquent.
•
Incurred losses.
Incurred losses were $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $308 million was attributable to new delinquencies driven mostly by borrower forbearance as a result of COVID-19.
Our U.S. mortgage insurance business strengthened its existing reserves by $65 million in 2020 primarily driven by the deterioration of early cure emergence patterns impacting claim frequency along with a modest increase in claim severity.
•
Mortgage originations and new insurance written
. Estimated mortgage origination volume increased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily from low interest rates which resulted in higher refinance origination volumes and to a lesser degree higher purchase originations. In addition, the estimated private mortgage insurance available market increased driven by higher refinance originations and higher purchase market penetration. Given the volume to date, we expect mortgage originations to remain strong into the first quarter of 2021 fueled by sustained low interest rates driving refinances and by continued strength in the purchase originations market. Due to higher mortgage originations and a larger private mortgage insurance market, our new insurance written increased to $99.9 billion in 2020, a 60% increase compared to 2019. Higher new insurance written continues to drive growth in our primary insurance in force.
•
Persistency.
The growth in our primary insurance in-force
from higher new insurance written was partially offset by lower persistency in 2020 from low interest rates. Our primary persistency declined to 59% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 76% for the year ended December 31, 2019. In
addition, lower persistency in our U.S. mortgage insurance business has impacted business performance in several other ways including, but not limited to, elevating single premium policy cancellations resulting in higher earned premiums and accelerating the amortization of our existing reinsurance transactions reducing their associated PMIERs capital credit.
•
PMIERs compliance.
On December 4, 2020, the GSEs issued both temporary and permanent amendments to PMIERs, which became effective retroactively on June 30, 2020. For loans that became non-performing
due to a COVID-19
hardship, PMIERs was temporarily amended with respect to each non-performing
loan. As of December 31, 2020, our U.S. mortgage insurance business had estimated available assets of 137% above the published PMIERs requirements compared to 132% as of September 30, 2020 and 138% as of December 31, 2019. The estimated sufficiency as of December 31, 2020 was $1,229 million of available assets above the published PMIERs requirements compared to $1,074 million as of September 30, 2020 and $1,057 million as of December 31, 2019. PMIERs sufficiency is based on the published requirements applicable to private mortgage insurers and does not give effect to the GSE Restrictions recently imposed on our U.S. mortgage insurance business. The increase in PMIERs sufficiency compared to September 30, 2020 was driven in part by the completion of an insurance linked note transaction in October 2020 and elevated lapses driven by prevailing low interest rates, partially offset by elevated new insurance written. In addition, elevated lapses drove an acceleration of the amortization of our existing reinsurance transactions reducing their PMIERs capital credit in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our PMIERs required assets as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020 benefited from the application of a 0.30 multiplier applied to the risk-based required asset amount factor for certain non-performing
loans. The application of the 0.30 multiplier to all eligible delinquencies provided $1,046 million and $1,217 million, respectively, of benefit to our December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020 PMIERs required assets. For additional information related to PMIERs, see “Item 1 - Business-Regulation-Mortgage Insurance Regulation-Other U.S. regulation and Agency Qualification Requirements.”
•
PMIERs restrictions
.
In September 2020, the GSEs imposed certain restrictions with respect to capital on our U.S. mortgage insurance business for the later of six quarters or until certain conditions are met. For additional information related to these PMIERs restrictions, see “Item 1 - Business-Regulation-Mortgage Insurance Regulation-Other U.S. Regulation and Agency Qualification Requirements.” These restrictions require GMICO to maintain a buffer above PMIERs Minimum Required Assets, GMHI to retain $300 million in holding company cash to be available for limited purposes and prior written approval from the GSEs before any additional debt issuance by GMHI or GMICO.
•
GMHI debt offering.
On August 21, 2020, GMHI, our wholly-owned U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiary, issued $750 million of its 6.50% senior notes due in 2025. A dividend of $437 million was paid to Genworth Holdings from the net cash proceeds of the offering with the remaining amount retained by GMHI.
Australia Mortgage Insurance
•
Regulatory capital.
As of December 31, 2020, our Australia mortgage insurance business estimated its PCA ratio was approximately 165%, representing a decrease from 191% as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was principally from loss reserve strengthening predominantly driven by a refinement in methodology and anticipated claims outcomes due to the economic impacts caused by COVID-19,
a DAC write-off of AUD$182 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020 in connection with the completion of liability adequacy testing under local Australian Accounting Standards (“AAS”) and from strong new business written in 2020.
•
Premium earnings pattern review.
Our mortgage insurance business in Australia completed a review of its premium earnings pattern in the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted in no changes to the earnings pattern adopted in previous years.
•
Key customers.
In May 2020, following a request-for-proposal
process, our second largest customer in our Australia mortgage insurance business advised us that they would not renew their contract with us. The contract with this customer expired in November 2020. This customer represented 11% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2020. While the termination of the contract with this customer will reduce gross written premiums in 2021, it is expected to modestly impact future financial results of our mortgage insurance business in Australia.
U.S. Life Insurance
•
In-force
rate actions in our long-term care insurance business.
As part of our strategy for our long-term care insurance business, we have been implementing, and expect to continue to pursue, significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on older generation blocks of business in order to bring those blocks closer to a break-even point over time and reduce the strain on earnings and capital. We are also requesting premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on newer blocks of business, as needed, some of which may be significant, to help bring their loss ratios back towards their original pricing. For all of these in-force
rate action filings, we received 144 filing approvals from 37 states in 2020, representing a weighted-average increase of 34% on approximately $1,008 million in annualized in-force
premiums, or approximately $344 million of incremental annual premiums. We also submitted 245 new filings in 50 states in 2020 on approximately $1,485 million in annualized in-force
premiums.
•
Cumulative economic benefit from in-force
rate actions.
We estimate that the cumulative economic benefit of our rate increases through 2020 equals approximately $14.5 billion, on a net present value basis, of the total amount required under our multi-year in-force
rate action plan in our long-term care insurance business. For additional information on the impact in-force
rate actions have on loss recognition testing of our long-term care insurance business, see “-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.”
•
Completion of annual long-term care insurance reviews.
We conducted a detailed review of our assumptions and methodologies of our claim reserves and future policy benefits for our long-term care insurance business and completed loss recognition testing in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of changes to certain assumptions and methodologies, we recorded a modest net favorable impact in 2020. In 2019, we did not make any significant changes to the assumptions or methodologies. See “-Critical Accounting Estimates” for additional information.
•
Long-term care insurance margins.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed our annual assumption review for our long-term care insurance business and in aggregate our U.S. GAAP margins remained in the same range as our 2019 margins. For additional information on reserves, see “-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.”
•
Completion of life insurance assumption review
. We conduct a review of our assumptions for our universal and term universal life insurance products annually. In the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the review, we recorded a $60 million net favorable adjustment to net income in our term universal and universal life insurance products. The positive impact to earnings was primarily due to a model refinement in our term universal life insurance product related to persistency and grace period timing and lower projected cost of insurance assessments on our universal life insurance products. In the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of the review, we recorded a $107 million unfavorable adjustment to net income in our universal and term universal life insurance products. For additional information see “-Critical Accounting Estimates-Policyholder account balances.”
•
Profits followed by losses reserve in our long-term care insurance business.
With respect to our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, our future projections indicate we have projected profits in earlier periods followed by projected losses in later periods. As a result of this pattern of projected profits followed by projected losses, we ratably accrue additional future policy benefit reserves over the profitable periods, currently expected to be through 2031, by the amounts
necessary to offset estimated losses during the periods that follow. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased our long-term care insurance future policy benefit reserves by $302 million, including $55 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, to accrue for profits followed by losses. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount accrued for profits followed by losses was $625 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
•
Payment of Genworth Holdings’ February 2021 senior notes.
Genworth Holdings paid its 7.20% senior notes with a principal balance of $338 million at maturity on February 16, 2021.
•
Australia mortgage insurance debt issuance and redemption.
On July 30, 2020, GFMIPL issued AUD$190 million floating rate subordinated notes due in July 2030, part of which was issued in exchange for AUD$147 million of its floating rate subordinated notes due in July 2025. On August 24, 2020 and October 6, 2020, GFMIPL redeemed AUD$5 million and the remaining AUD$48 million, respectively, of its floating rate subordinated notes due in July 2025 and paid accrued interest thereon.
•
Redemption of Genworth Holdings’ June 2020 senior notes.
On January 21, 2020, Genworth Holdings early redeemed $397 million of its 7.70% senior notes originally scheduled to mature in June 2020 for a pre-tax
loss of $9 million. The senior notes were fully redeemed with a cash payment of $409 million, comprised of the outstanding principal balance of $397 million, accrued interest of $3 million and a make-whole premium of $9 million.
•
Repurchase of Genworth Holdings’ 2021 senior notes.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Genworth Holdings repurchased $84 million principal amount of its senior notes with 2021 maturity dates for a pre-tax
gain of $4 million and paid accrued interest thereon.
•
Redemption of non-recourse
funding obligations.
In January 2020, upon receipt of approval from the Director of Insurance of the State of South Carolina, Rivermont Life Insurance Company I (“Rivermont I”), our indirect wholly-owned special purpose consolidated captive insurance subsidiary, redeemed all of its $315 million of outstanding non-recourse
funding obligations due in 2050. The early redemption resulted in a pre-tax
loss of $4 million from the write-off
of deferred borrowing costs.
•
AXA promissory note.
On December 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our lifestyle protection insurance business to AXA. In 2017, AXA sued us for damages on an indemnity in the 2015 agreement related to alleged remediation it paid to customers who purchased payment protection insurance. On July 20, 2020, we reached a settlement agreement with AXA for losses incurred from mis-selling
complaints on policies sold from 1970 through 2004. Under the settlement agreement we agreed to make two installment payments to AXA for approximately £317 million in 2022. We further agreed to pay AXA for future claims that are still being processed currently estimated to be approximately £108 million that will be due with the final installment payment in 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount owed to AXA under the settlement agreement is £425 million ($581 million) which is included in liabilities related to discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet.
•
Liquidity and contractual obligations.
For additional details related to Genworth Holdings’ liquidity in relation to its contractual obligations, see note 1 in our consolidated financial statements under “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
•
Secured term loan repayment.
On December 12, 2019, Genworth Holdings repaid its senior secured term loan facility (“Term Loan”), which was originally closed on March 7, 2018 and was scheduled to mature in March 2023. Prior to the repayment, Genworth Financial International Holdings, LLC (“GFIH”) provided a limited recourse guarantee to the lenders of Genworth Holdings’ outstanding Term Loan, which was secured by GFIH’s ownership interest in Genworth Canada’s outstanding common shares. Due to the sale of the underlying collateral, the Term Loan was required to be repaid upon the sale of Genworth Canada. A cash payment of $445 million was used to fully repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Term Loan.
Regulation and Taxes
•
The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 26.2% and 27.3%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a lower effect from foreign operations and gains on forward starting swaps settled prior to the enactment of the TCJA, which will continue to be tax effected at 35% as they are amortized into net investment income, in relation to higher pre-tax
income in 2020. See note 13 in our consolidated financial statements under “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Dispositions
•
Sale of our lifestyle protection insurance business.
As discussed above, on July 20, 2020, we reached a settlement agreement with AXA. An after-tax
loss of $549 million and $110 million is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, associated with the case and settlement agreement. We have established our current best estimates for future claims that are still being processed under the settlement agreement, as well as for the unrelated liability related to underwriting losses and other expenses; however, there may be future adjustments to these estimates. If amounts are different from our estimates, it could result in an adjustment to our liabilities and an additional amount reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations. See notes 20 and 23 in our consolidated financial statements under “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
•
Sale of our Canada mortgage insurance business.
On December 12, 2019, we completed the sale of Genworth Canada, our former Canada mortgage insurance business, to Brookfield and received approximately $1.7 billion in net cash proceeds. During 2019, we recorded an after-tax
loss of $121 million related to the sale. See note 23 in our consolidated financial statements under “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The accounting estimates (including sensitivities) discussed in this section are those that we consider to be particularly critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results. The sensitivities included in this section involve matters that are also inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment in selecting the factors and amounts used in the sensitivities. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities or the use of different factors could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected in the sensitivities. For all of these accounting estimates, we caution that future events seldom develop as estimated and management’s best estimates often require adjustment. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements.”
Insurance liabilities and reserves
.
We calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders and contractholders based on actuarial assumptions and in accordance with U.S. GAAP and industry practice. We build these reserves as the estimated value of those obligations increases, and we release these reserves as those future obligations are paid, experience changes or policies lapse. The reserves we establish reflect estimates and actuarial assumptions and methodologies with regard to our future experience. These estimates and actuarial assumptions and methodologies involve the exercise of significant judgment and are inherently uncertain. These estimates and actuarial assumptions and methodologies are subjected to a variety of internal reviews and, in some cases, external independent reviews. Our future financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions we have used in determining our reserves as well as the assumptions originally used in pricing our products.
Many factors, and changes in these factors, can affect future experience including, but not limited to: interest rates; investment returns and volatility; economic and social conditions, such as inflation, unemployment,
home price appreciation or depreciation, and healthcare experience; policyholder persistency or lapses; insured mortality; insured morbidity; future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions; expenses; and doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Because these assumptions relate to factors that are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past had, material impacts on our reserve levels, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we may not be able to mitigate the impact of unexpected adverse experience by increasing premiums and/or other charges to policyholders (where we have the right to do so) or by offering benefit reductions as an alternative to increasing premiums.
Insurance reserves differ for long- and short-duration insurance policies. Measurement of reserves for long-duration insurance contracts (such as life insurance, annuity and long-term care insurance products) is based on approved actuarial methods, and includes assumptions about mortality, morbidity, lapses, interest rates and other factors. Short-duration contracts are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period’s claims, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. Short-duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events.
Future policy benefits
The liability for future policy benefits is equal to the present value of expected future benefits and expenses, less the present value of expected future net premiums based on assumptions including projected interest rates and investment returns, health care experience, policyholder persistency or lapses, insured mortality, insured morbidity and expenses, all of which are locked-in
at the time the policies are issued or acquired. In our long-term care insurance business, our assumptions used in loss recognition testing also include significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions that have been filed and approved or are anticipated to be approved (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed). The liability for future policy benefits is reviewed at least annually as a part of our loss recognition testing using current assumptions based on the manner of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of the insurance contracts. Loss recognition testing is generally performed at the line of business level, with acquired blocks and certain reinsured blocks tested separately. Changes in how we manage certain polices could require separate loss recognition testing and could result in future charges to net income. If loss recognition testing indicates a premium deficiency, the liability for future policy benefits is measured using updated assumptions, which become the new locked-in
assumptions utilized going forward unless another premium deficiency charge is recorded.
See notes 2 and 9 in our consolidated financial statements under “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information related to insurance reserves.
Long-term care insurance block, excluding our acquired block
We annually perform loss recognition testing for the liability for future policy benefits for our long-term care insurance products in the aggregate, excluding our acquired block of long-term care insurance, which is tested separately. The results of loss recognition testing are driven by changes to assumptions and methodologies primarily impacting claim termination rates, incidence and benefit utilization rates, as well as in-force
rate actions. Claim termination rates refer to the expected rates at which claims end. Incidence rates represent the likelihood the policyholder will go on claim. Benefit utilization rates estimate how much of the available policy benefits are expected to be used.
Our assumption for future in-force
rate actions is based on our best estimate of the rate increases we expect given our claim cost expectations and uses our historical experience from rate increase approvals. In addition, we review other assumptions, particularly related to lapse rates, morbidity, mortality improvement and expenses, and update these assumptions as appropriate.
In 2020 and 2019, the results of our loss recognition testing on our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, indicated that our DAC was recoverable and reserves were sufficient, with a margin of approximately $400 million to $800 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to approximately $400 million to $700 million as of December 31, 2019. The margin in 2020 included updates for claim terminations and incidence and benefit utilization, among others. These updates drove changes to our in-force
rate action plan. The margin reflected an assumption for future in-force
rate actions (anticipated to be approved, including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed) of approximately $8.0 billion in 2020 and approximately $7.6 billion in 2019. The increase in our future rate actions in 2020 was a result of new future unapproved in-force
rate actions added, partially offset by in-force
rate action approvals received during 2020. A change in the expected amount of in-force
rate actions would impact the results of our long-term care insurance margin testing, whereby any unexpected reduction in the amount of in-force
rate actions would negatively impact our margins and could result in a premium deficiency.
We assume a static discount rate that is in line with our current portfolio yield. Our discount rate assumption for our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, was 5.34% and 5.39% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. This rate represents our expected investment returns based on the portfolio of assets supporting the net U.S. GAAP liability as of the calculation date and, therefore, excluded the impacts of qualifying hedge gains that are not currently amortizing. In the select sensitivities below, for both our long-term care insurance block excluding our acquired block and our acquired block, the 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate refers to a reduction in our portfolio yields. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the liability for future policy benefits associated with our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, was $26.9 billion and $24.1 billion, respectively.
The impact on our 2020 long-term care insurance loss recognition testing margin for select sensitivities were as follows:
The margin impacts in the table above are each discrete and do not reflect the impact one factor may have on another. For example, the increases in claim costs do not include any offsetting impacts from potential future in-force
rate actions. Any such offset from in-force
rate actions would primarily impact our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block.
Any future adverse changes in our assumptions could result in both the impairment of DAC associated with our long-term care insurance products as well as the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves. Any favorable variation would result in additional margin and higher income recognized over the remaining duration of the in-force
block. Our positive margin for our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, is dependent on our assumptions regarding our ability to successfully implement our in-force
rate action strategy involving premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. For our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, any adverse changes in assumptions would only be reflected in net income as a loss to the extent the margin was reduced below zero.
Profits followed by losses
With respect to our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, while loss recognition testing supports that in the aggregate our reserves are sufficient, our future projections indicate we have projected
profits in earlier periods followed by projected losses in later periods. As a result of this pattern of projected profits followed by projected losses, we will ratably accrue additional future policy benefit reserves over the profitable periods, currently expected to be through 2031, by the amounts necessary to offset estimated losses during the periods that follow. Such additional reserves are updated each period and calculated based on our estimate of the amount necessary to offset the losses in future periods utilizing expected income and current best estimate assumptions based on actual and anticipated experience, consistent with our loss recognition testing. We adjust the accrual rate prospectively, over the remaining profit periods, without any catch-up
adjustment. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we increased our long-term care insurance future policy benefit reserves by $302 million and $213 million, respectively, to accrue for profits followed by losses. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount accrued for profits followed by losses was $625 million. The accrual is recorded quarterly and is impacted by the pattern and present value of expected future losses which are updated annually at the time in which we perform loss recognition testing. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our loss recognition testing assumptions, which included changes from our annual assumption review completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as updates to our future in-force
rate actions. The present value of expected future losses was approximately $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate a factor of approximately 76% of those profits on our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, will be accrued in the future to offset estimated future losses during later periods. As of December 31, 2019, we estimated a factor of approximately 80% to ratably accrue additional future policy benefits. The decrease in the factor was mostly driven by higher actual profits in 2020 resulting in a larger increase in accrued future policy benefits during 2020, partially offset by the updated profit pattern from our annual review of assumptions completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, as well as updates to our future in-force
rate actions. There may be future adjustments to this estimate reflecting any variety of new and adverse trends that could result in increases to future policy benefit reserves for our profits followed by losses accrual, and such future increases could possibly be material to our results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.
Acquired block of long-term care insurance
In 2014, we had a premium deficiency in our acquired block of long-term care insurance; therefore, our assumptions that were updated in connection with the premium deficiency have remained locked-in.
These updated assumptions will remain locked-in
unless, and until such time as, another premium deficiency occurs. Due to the premium deficiency that existed in 2014, we monitor our acquired block more frequently than annually.
As of December 31, 2020, our acquired block of long-term care insurance had positive margin of approximately $100 million to $200 million compared to approximately $100 million to $300 million as of December 31, 2019. Our discount rate assumption was 6.44% and 7.00% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the liability for future policy benefits associated with our acquired block of long-term care insurance was $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.
The impact on our 2020 long-term care insurance loss recognition testing margin for select sensitivities were as follows:
The margin impacts in the table above are each discrete and do not reflect the impact one factor may have on another. For example, the increases in claim costs do not include any incremental adverse impacts from a potential decrease in the discount rate. Due to the age of our acquired block, it would not benefit significantly
from future in-force
rate actions, and therefore, there is a higher likelihood that adverse changes in our assumptions would result in an additional premium deficiency. The impacts of future adverse changes in our assumptions resulting in another premium deficiency would result in the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves and would be immediately reflected in net income as a loss if our margin for this block is again reduced below zero. Any favorable variation would result in additional margin and higher income recognized over the remaining duration of the in-force
block but would not have an immediate benefit to net income.
Term and whole life insurance
Similar to our long-term care insurance products, we annually perform loss recognition testing for the liability for future policy benefits for our term and whole life insurance products, excluding our acquired block, which is tested separately. The margin of our term and whole life insurance products has fluctuated over the years. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had margin of approximately $300 million to $800 million and $200 million to $600 million, respectively, and a DAC balance of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, on our term and whole life insurance products, excluding the acquired block. If our margin is reduced below zero for our term and whole life insurance products, excluding our acquired block, we would amortize DAC up to the amount of DAC recorded on our balance sheet and if DAC was fully written off, establish additional future policy benefit reserves, either of which would result in a charge to net income.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had margin of approximately $100 million to $300 million and $100 million to $400 million, respectively, and a PVFP balance of $73 million and $74 million, respectively, on our acquired block of term and whole life insurance products. If our margin is reduced below zero for our acquired block of term and whole life insurance products, we would amortize PVFP up to the amount of PVFP recorded on our balance sheet and if PVFP was fully written off, establish additional future policy benefit reserves, either of which would result in a charge to net income.
The risks we face mostly include adverse variations in mortality and lapse assumptions. Adverse experience in one or all of these risks could result in the DAC associated with our term and whole life insurance products, excluding our acquired block and PVFP associated with our acquired block of term and whole life insurance products to no longer be fully recoverable as well as the required establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves. Any favorable variation would result in additional margin and higher income recognized over the remaining duration of the in-force
block. The sensitivities in the table below are changes that we consider to be reasonably possible given historical changes in market conditions and our experience with these products.
The impact on our 2020 term and whole life insurance loss recognition testing margin for select sensitivities were as follows:
The margin impacts in the table above are each discrete and do not reflect the impact one factor may have on another.
Fixed immediate annuities
U.S. GAAP prohibits a change (or unlocking) of assumptions on traditional long-duration insurance products unless recoverability testing, also known as loss recognition testing, deems them to be inadequate. Due to the premium deficiency that existed in 2016, we perform loss recognition testing on our fixed immediate
annuity products more frequently than annually. In 2016, a premium deficiency in our fixed immediate annuity products resulted in the write-off
of the entire DAC balance associated with these products. Accordingly, the premium deficiencies that occurred subsequent to 2016 resulted in the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves and were also reflected as a loss in net income.
Persistent low interest rates have impacted, and may continue to impact, the margins of our fixed immediate annuity products. In 2020, the results of our loss recognition testing did not result in a premium deficiency; therefore, our liability for future policy benefits was sufficient. However, in 2019 and 2018, we determined we had premium deficiencies in our fixed immediate annuity products as a result of loss recognition testing and we increased our future policy benefit reserves and recognized expenses of $39 million and $22 million, respectively. The premium deficiency test results were primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and updated assumptions. The updated assumptions will remain locked-in
until such time as we determine another premium deficiency exists.
The impacts of future adverse changes in our assumptions would result in the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves and would be immediately reflected as a loss in net income if our margin for this block is again reduced below zero. Any favorable variation would result in additional margin and higher income recognized over the remaining duration of the in-force
block but would not have an immediate benefit to net income. The risks we face include adverse variations in interest rates, credit spreads and mortality. Adverse experience in one or all of these risks would negatively impact our margin for this block. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that a 10 basis point reduction in asset yields from the December 31, 2020 level or 2% lower mortality, scenarios that we consider to be reasonably possible given historical changes in market conditions and experience on our fixed immediate annuity products, would result in a reduction to margin of approximately $28 million or $21 million, respectively. Currently, these reductions are not sufficient to reduce our margin for this block below zero. However, future adverse variations could reduce our margin below zero which would result in the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves and reflected as a loss in net income.
Policyholder account balances
The liability for policyholder account balances represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date for investment-type and universal and term universal life insurance contracts. We are also required to establish additional benefit reserves for guarantees or product features in addition to the contract value where the additional benefit reserves are calculated by applying a benefit ratio to accumulated contractholder assessments, and then deducting accumulated paid claims. The benefit ratio is equal to the ratio of benefits to assessments, accumulated with interest and considering both past and anticipated future claims experience, which includes assumptions for insured mortality, interest rates and policyholder persistency or lapses, among other assumptions.
We perform an annual review of assumptions for our universal and term universal life insurance products, typically in the fourth quarter. Our 2020 test resulted in a decrease in the liability for policyholder account balances of $118 million, with a corresponding pre-tax
benefit recorded to net income, primarily due to a model refinement in our term universal life insurance product related to persistency and grace period timing and lower projected cost of insurance assessments on our universal life insurance products. Other assumption updates mostly focused on long-term trends in mortality, persistency and interest rates. Our 2019 and 2018 tests resulted in an increase in the liability for policyholder account balances of $72 million and $119 million, respectively, with a corresponding pre-tax
loss recorded to net income. The 2019 and 2018 test results were predominantly impacted by emerging mortality experience, lower expected growth in interest rates and a prolonged low interest rate environment.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had DAC of $245 million and $333 million, respectively, and total policyholder account balances including reserves in excess of the contract value of $9.7 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, related to our universal and term universal life insurance products. As of December 31, 2020, for
our universal and term universal life insurance products, we estimate that a 100 basis point reduction in interest rates from the December 31, 2020 level, or 2% higher mortality, scenarios that we consider to be reasonably possible given historical changes in market conditions and experience on these products, would result in a loss recorded to net income of approximately $1 million and $38 million, respectively. Adverse experience in persistency could also result in the DAC amortization associated with these products to be accelerated as well as the establishment of higher additional benefit reserves. Any favorable changes in these assumptions would result in lower DAC amortization as well as a reduction in the liability for policyholder account balances.
Liability for policy and contract claims
The liability for policy and contract claims represents the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. The estimated liability includes requirements for future payments of: (a) claims that have been reported to the insurer; (b) claims related to insured events that have occurred but that have not been reported to the insurer as of the date the liability is estimated; and (c) claim adjustment expenses. Claim adjustment expenses include costs incurred in the claim settlement process such as legal fees and costs to record, process and adjust claims.
Our liability for policy and contract claims is reviewed regularly, with changes in our estimates of future claims recorded through net income.
The following table sets forth our recorded liability for policy and contract claims by business as of December 31:
Long-term care insurance
The liability for policy and contract claims, also known as claim reserves, for our long-term care insurance products represents the present value of the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. Key assumptions include investment returns, health care experience, insured mortality, insured morbidity and expenses. Our discount rate assumption assumes a static discount rate in line with our current portfolio yield.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reviewed our assumptions and methodologies relating to our claim reserves of our long-term care insurance business and made certain changes to our assumptions or methodologies, particularly those assumptions used to calculate our IBNR reserves. In total, these updates reduced our liability for policy and contract claims by $38 million. During the third quarter of 2019, we reviewed our assumptions and methodologies relating to our claim reserves of our long-term care insurance business but did not make any significant changes to the assumptions or methodologies, other than routine updates to investment returns and benefit utilization rates as we typically do each quarter. These updates did not have a significant impact on claim reserve levels. As experience has emerged in the past, we have made resulting changes to our assumptions that have had a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our experience will continue to emerge and as a result there is a potential for future assumption reviews to result in further updates.
Mortgage insurance
Estimates of mortgage insurance reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on notices of mortgage loan defaults and estimates of defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, using assumptions developed based on past experience and our expectation of future development. The estimates are determined using either a factor-based approach, in which assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim are calculated using traditional actuarial techniques, or a case-based approach, in which each individual delinquent loan is reviewed and a best-estimate loss is determined based on the status of the insured loan and an estimation of net sale proceeds from the disposition of the mortgaged property. Assumptions also include provisions for loans within our delinquency inventory that will be rescinded or modified (collectively referred to as “loss mitigation actions”) based on the effects that such loss mitigation actions have had on our historical claim frequency rates, including an estimate for reinstatement of previously rescinded coverage. Each of these inherently judgmental assumptions is established in a respective geography based on historical and expected experience. We have established processes, as well as contractual rights, to ensure we receive timely information from loan servicers to aid us in the establishment of our estimates. In addition, when we have obtained sufficient facts and circumstances through our investigative process, we have the unilateral right under our master policies and at law to rescind coverage on the underlying loan certificate as if coverage never existed. As is common accounting practice in the mortgage insurance industry and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, loss reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default.
Management reviews the loss reserves quarterly for adequacy, and if indicated, updates the assumptions used for estimating and calculating such reserves based on actual experience and our historical frequency of claim and severity of loss rates that are applied to the current population of delinquencies. Factors considered in establishing loss reserves include claim frequency patterns (reflecting the loss mitigation actions on such claim patterns), the aged category of the delinquency (i.e., age and progression of delinquency to claim), the severity of loss and loan coverage percentage. The establishment of our mortgage insurance loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires judgment. The actual amount of the claim payments may vary significantly from the loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be adversely affected by several factors, including, but not limited to, a deterioration of regional or national economic conditions leading to a reduction in borrowers’ income and thus their ability to make mortgage payments, a drop in housing values that could expose us to greater loss on resale of properties obtained through foreclosure proceedings and an adverse change in the effectiveness of loss mitigation actions that could result in an increase in the frequency of expected claim rates. Our estimates are also affected by the extent of fraud and misrepresentation that we uncover in the loans that we have insured and the coverage upon which we have consequently rescinded or may rescind going forward. Our loss reserving methodology includes estimates of the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will be rescinded or modified, as well as estimates of the number of loans for which coverage may be reinstated under certain conditions following a rescission action.
In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying management’s best estimate of our mortgage insurance reserves for losses, it is possible that even a relatively small change in estimated delinquency-to-claim
rate (“frequency”) or a relatively small percentage change in estimated claim amount (“severity”) could have a significant impact on reserves and, correspondingly, on results of operations. For example, based on our actual experience during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 in our U.S. mortgage insurance business, a quarterly change of 3% in the average frequency reserve factor would change the gross reserve amount for such quarter by approximately $72 million for our U.S. mortgage insurance business. Based on our actual experience during 2020, a quarterly increase of $1,000 in the severity of our average reserves combined with a 1% change in the average frequency reserve factor would change the gross reserve amount by approximately $10 million for our mortgage insurance business in Australia based on current exchange rates.
Unearned premiums
. In our mortgage insurance business in Australia, the majority of our insurance contracts are single premium. We also have single premium insurance contracts in our U.S. mortgage insurance
business, although these products make up a smaller portion of our product mix in the United States. The majority of our insurance contracts in our U.S. mortgage insurance business have recurring premiums, as discussed below. For single premium insurance contracts, we recognize premiums over the policy life in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence. We recognize a portion of the revenue in premiums earned in the current period, while the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums, and earned over time in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence. If single premium policies are cancelled and the premium is non-refundable,
then the remaining unearned premium related to each cancelled policy is recognized as earned premiums upon notification of the cancellation, if not included in our expected earnings pattern. The expected pattern of risk emergence on which we base premium recognition is inherently judgmental and is based on actuarial analysis of historical and expected experience. In our mortgage insurance business in Australia, we recognize unearned premiums over a period of up to 12 years, most of which are recognized between two and six years from issue date. The recognition of earned premiums for our mortgage insurance businesses involves significant estimates and assumptions as to future loss development and policy cancellations. These assumptions are based on our historical experience and our expectations of future performance, which are highly dependent on assumptions as to long-term macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, home price appreciation and the rate of unemployment. We periodically review our expected pattern of risk emergence and make adjustments based on actual experience and changes in our expectation of future performance with any adjustments reflected in current period net income. Changes in market conditions could cause a decline in mortgage originations, mortgage insurance penetration rates or our market share, all of which could impact new insurance written. For example, a decline in flow new insurance written of $1.0 billion in Australia would result in a reduction in earned premiums of approximately $2 million in the first full year following the decline in flow new insurance written based on current pricing and expected pattern of risk emergence. However, this decline would be partially offset by the recognition of earned premiums from established unearned premium reserves primarily from the last three years of business.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of unearned premiums, of which $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, related to our mortgage insurance business in Australia and $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, related to our U.S. mortgage insurance business. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased earned premiums and decreased unearned premiums by $14 million related to our single premium earnings pattern review in our U.S. mortgage insurance business. There were no adjustments to earned premiums in our mortgage insurance businesses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018.
Our expected pattern of risk emergence for our mortgage insurance businesses is subject to change given the inherent uncertainty as to the underlying loss development and policy cancellation assumptions and the long duration of our international mortgage insurance policy contracts. Actual experience that is different than expected loss development or policy cancellations could result in further material increases or decreases in the recognition of earned premiums depending on the magnitude of the difference between actual and expected experience. Additional loss development emergence and policy cancellation variations could result in further increases or decreases in unearned premiums and could impact operating results depending on the magnitude of variation experienced (assuming other assumptions held constant).
In our U.S. mortgage insurance business, the majority of our insurance contracts have recurring premiums. We recognize recurring premiums over the terms of the related insurance policy on a pro-rata
basis (i.e., monthly). Changes in market conditions could cause a decline in mortgage originations, mortgage insurance penetration rates and our market share, all of which could impact new insurance written. For example, a decline in primary new insurance written of $1.0 billion would result in a reduction in earned premiums of approximately $4 million in the first full year. Likewise, if primary persistency declined on our existing insurance in-force
by 10%, earned premiums would decline by approximately $100 million during the first full year, potentially offset by lower reserves due to policies no longer being in-force.
The remaining portion of our unearned premiums primarily relates to our long-term care insurance business where the underlying assumptions related to premium recognition are not subject to significant uncertainty.
Accordingly, changes in underlying assumptions we consider reasonably possible for this business would not result in a material impact to premium recognition or our results of operations.
Deferred acquisition costs.
DAC represents costs that are directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and investment contracts which are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies. These costs primarily include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses for policies successfully acquired. DAC is subsequently amortized to expense in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits.
The amortization of DAC for traditional long-duration insurance products (including term life insurance, life-contingent structured settlements and immediate annuities and long-term care insurance) is determined as a level proportion of premiums based on accepted actuarial methods and reasonable assumptions, including related to projected interest rates and investment returns, health care experience (including type of care and cost of care), policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force
from one period to the next), insured mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), insured morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates) and expenses, established when the contract or policy is issued. U.S. GAAP requires that assumptions for these types of products not be modified (or unlocked) unless recoverability testing, also known as loss recognition testing, deems them to be inadequate. Amortization is adjusted each period to reflect actual lapses or terminations. Accordingly, we could experience accelerated amortization of DAC and a charge to net income if policies lapse or terminate earlier than originally assumed, or if we fail recoverability testing.
Amortization of DAC for deferred annuity and universal life insurance contracts is based on expected gross profits. Expected gross profits are adjusted quarterly to reflect actual experience to date or for the unlocking of underlying key assumptions including interest rates, policyholder persistency or lapses, insured mortality and expenses. The estimation of expected gross profits is subject to change given the inherent uncertainty as to the underlying key assumptions employed and the long duration of our policy or contract liabilities. Changes in expected gross profits reflecting the unlocking of underlying key assumptions could result in a material increase or decrease in the amortization of DAC depending on the magnitude of the change in underlying assumptions. Significant factors that could result in a material increase or decrease in DAC amortization for these products include material changes in withdrawal or lapse rates, investment spreads or mortality assumptions. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, key assumptions were unlocked in our U.S. Life Insurance and Runoff segments to reflect our current expectation of future investment spreads, lapse rates and mortality.
We review DAC for recoverability at least annually. For deferred annuity and universal life insurance contracts, if the present value of expected future gross profits is less than the unamortized DAC for a line of business, a charge to net income is recorded for additional DAC amortization. For traditional long-duration and short-duration contracts, if the benefit reserves plus the current estimate of expected future gross premiums and interest income for a line of business are less than the current estimate of expected future benefits and expenses (including any unamortized DAC), a charge to net income is recorded for additional DAC amortization or for increased benefit reserves. The evaluation of DAC recoverability is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment and estimates to determine the present values of future premiums, estimated gross profits and expected benefits and expenses of our businesses. In 2020, in connection with our review of DAC for recoverability, we wrote off $63 million of DAC in our universal life insurance products due principally to lower future estimated gross profits.
The amortization of DAC for mortgage insurance is based on expected gross margins. Expected gross margins, defined as premiums less losses, are set based on assumptions for future persistency and loss development of the business. These assumptions are updated for actual experience to date or as our expectations of future experience are revised based on experience studies. Due to the inherent uncertainties in making assumptions about future events, materially different experience from expected results in persistency or loss development could result in a material increase or decrease to DAC amortization.
The DAC amortization methodology for our variable products (variable annuities and variable universal life insurance) includes a long-term average appreciation assumption of 7.5% to 8.0%. When actual returns vary from the expected 7.5% to 8.0%, we assume a reversion to the expected return over a three-year period.
The following table sets forth the increase (decrease) in amortization of DAC related to unlocking of underlying key assumptions by segment for the years ended December 31:
Impacts on DAC from assumption reviews
In the fourth quarter of 2020, as part of our annual review of assumptions, we increased DAC amortization by $48 million in our universal and term universal life insurance products predominantly due to changes in expected gross profits driven mostly by lower projected cost of insurance assessments on our universal life insurance products and a model refinement in our term universal life insurance product related to persistency and grace period timing.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, as part of a periodic review of assumptions, our U.S. mortgage insurance business increased DAC amortization by $6 million primarily driven by elevated lapses in 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, no assumptions were unlocked in our mortgage insurance businesses.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of our annual review of assumptions, we increased DAC amortization by $58 million in our universal and term universal life insurance products, reflecting updated assumptions primarily related to the lower interest rate environment.
See notes 2 and 6 in our consolidated financial statements under “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information related to DAC.
Valuation of fixed maturity securities.
Our portfolio of fixed maturity securities comprises primarily investment grade securities, which are carried at fair value.
The methodologies, estimates and assumptions used in valuing our fixed maturity securities evolve over time and are subject to different interpretations, all of which can lead to materially different estimates of fair value. Additionally, because the valuation is based on market conditions at a specific point in time, the period-to-period
changes in fair value may vary significantly due to changing interest rates, external macroeconomic, and credit market conditions. For example, widening credit spreads will generally result in a decrease, while tightening of credit spreads will generally result in an increase, in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities. As well, during periods of increasing interest rates, the market values of lower-yielding assets will decline. See “
