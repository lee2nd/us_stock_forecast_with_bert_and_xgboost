Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
COVID-19 Outbreak
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the last quarter of 2020, the Company saw an unprecedented increase in demand and orders for its AHP300 ventilators, EPV200 ventilators, other respiratory care products, and other emergency medical devices. The Company has made capital investments, added employees, and increased inventory purchases in order to increase production of these ventilators and other products critical to the care of COVID-19 patients. The Company believes that the pandemic did result in increased sales in fiscal 2021, however, this peak in demand ended in fiscal 2021 and the impacts of the COVID-19 continue to develop.
Any increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations could decrease future demand for other products as hospitals reduce “non-essential procedures” as occurred at various times during fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The economic effects on hospitals and providers has negatively impacted the market for the Company’s construction products as hospitals cut back on construction and capital improvements. The duration and extent of this decreased demand is uncertain and depends on decisions by government health authorities, hospitals and providers in responding to and mitigating future COVID-19 outbreaks.
The pandemic is partially responsible for broad economic changes which have impacted the Company in fiscal 2021 and continue to impact the Company as the Company begins fiscal 2022. Inflation has raised the cost of products and services the Company uses to provide its products. In fiscal year 2021, the Company estimates that inflationary price increases raised product cost by approximately $500,000. While the Federal Reserve believes some of the inflation in the economy is transitory in nature, the Company believes inflation will continue to increase cost in fiscal 2022. Since the onset of the pandemic the Company has found it harder to hire and retain hourly workers. This has led to the requirement for additional overtime for existing employees, inefficiency, and contributed to delays in shipments. Travel restrictions have led to less travel spending. However, the restrictions have limited our interactions with customers and end-users. The Company believes these personal interactions are vital to communicate the advantages of our products and increase sales.
Results for the year ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended June 30, 2021 only partially reflect the impacts discussed above. The full economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as the date of this report. As such, the Company cannot predict with certainty the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. Please see Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors for more information.
Results of Operations
The Company manufactures and markets respiratory products, including respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products. Set forth below is certain information with respect to amounts and percentages of net sales attributable to respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the percentage of net sales represented by the various income and expense categories reflected in the Company’s Statement of Operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue recognition:
The Company’s revenues are derived primarily from the sales of respiratory products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products. The products are generally sold directly to distributors, customers affiliated with buying groups, individual customers and construction contractors, throughout the world.
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon satisfaction of its performance obligation which occurs on the transfer of control of the product, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Payment terms between Allied and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.
Management exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for early payment discounts, rebates and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales.
The Company provides rebates to wholesalers. Rebate amounts are based upon purchases using contractual amount for each product sold. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate and the customer or price terms that apply. Using known contractual allowances, the Company estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when it records the sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs in the month following the sale.
The Company regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and adjusts reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income.
Other allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because the Company’s historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.
The Company does not allocate transaction price as the Company has only one performance obligation and its contracts do not span multiple periods. All taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions and collected by the Company are excluded from the measurement of transaction price.
Inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory:
Inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined primarily based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two years’ usage on hand. This analysis considers those identified inventory items to determine, in management’s best estimate, if parts can be used beyond one year, if there are alternate uses or at what values such parts may be disposed for. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
Income taxes:
The Company accounts for income taxes under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740: “Income Taxes.” Under ASC 740, the deferred tax provision is determined using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income when such assets and liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as tax expense or benefit in the period that includes the enactment date of the change. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Management uses a more likely than not criterion in its assessment and considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance the Company first considers the reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies. To the extent these items are not sufficient to cause the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company would then consider the availability of future taxable income only to the extent such income is considered likely to occur based on the Company’s earnings history, current income trends and projections.
In light of its history of operating losses the Company does not rely on the existence of future taxable income as it currently cannot conclude future taxable income is likely to occur. The Company does rely on reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies to the extent available to support the value of its existing deferred tax assets. The tax planning strategies available to the Company that it would use rather than allow the tax benefits of net operating loss carryovers to expire include the revocation of the LIFO method inventory and the recognition of a gain on the sale of the Company’s excess land in Stuyvesant Falls, New York. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s deferred tax assets exceeded the amount supportable through reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies and a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
Accounts receivable net of allowances:
Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is determined based on an analysis of past due accounts including accounts placed with collection agencies, and an allowance for returns and credits, which is based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that the receivable will not be collected and/or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, accounts receivable is recorded net of allowances of $170,000.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:
The impairment of long-lived assets is assessed when changes in circumstances (such as, but not limited to, a decrease in market value of an asset, current and historical operating losses or a change in business strategy) indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is based on management’s expectations and judgments regarding future business and economic conditions, future market values and disposal costs. Actual results and events could differ significantly from management’s estimates. Based upon our most recent analysis, we believe that no impairment exists at June 30, 2021. There can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to net earnings (loss).
Self-insurance:
The Company maintains a self-insurance program for a portion of its health care costs. Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability for reported claims and the estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had approximately $120,000 and $150,000, respectively, of accrued liabilities related to health care claims. In order to establish the self-insurance reserves, the Company utilized actuarial estimates of expected claims based on analyses of historical data.
Share Based Compensation:
The Company calculates share based compensation using the Black-Sholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. For the twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Allied recorded approximately $14,000, $2,000 and $3,000, respectively, in share-based employee compensation. This compensation cost is included in the general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Statements of Operations.
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
The Company had income of $1.8 million before taxes for fiscal 2021, compared to a loss of $3.1 million before taxes for fiscal 2020. It recorded an income tax provision of $72,484 in fiscal 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $130,359 in fiscal 2020.
Net sales for fiscal 2021 of $36.3 million were $4.4 million or 13.8% higher than net sales of $31.9 million in fiscal 2020. Domestically, sales increased by $1.0 million dollars while international sales, which represented 33.4% of fiscal 2021 sales, were $3.4 million higher. The increase in domestic sales was largely attributable to increases in sales of construction products and emergency medical products. International business is dependent upon hospital construction projects, and the development of medical facilities and emergency services in those regions in which the Company operates, as well as the economic and political climates in those international markets.
Orders for the Company’s products for the year ended June 30, 2021 of $29.6 million were $11.2 million or 27.5% lower than orders for the year ended June 30, 2020 of $40.8 million. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal year 2020, the Company experienced significantly increased orders for the emergency medical products sold by the Company, including the Company’s AHP300 ventilator and the EPV200 ventilator. In fiscal year 2021 the pace of orders materially decreased.
Respiratory care product sales, which include homecare products, were $8.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $8.6 million in 2020. Respiratory care products include carbon dioxide absorbents. For the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company had carbon dioxide absorbent sales of Carbolime® and Litholyme® of $3.7 million.
Medical gas equipment sales, which include construction products, of $15.9 million in fiscal 2021 were approximately $0.6 million, or 3.9% higher than prior year levels of $15.3 million. The increase in sales was largely attributable to an increase sales of non-construction products of $1.5 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in international construction sales of $0.7 million. The Company continues to evaluate and strengthen its sales strategy in this market.
Emergency medical product sales in fiscal 2021 of $12.3 million were $4.2 million or 51.9% higher than fiscal 2020 sales of $8.1 million. International sales of emergency medical products increased by $3.3 million from the prior year while domestic sales increased by $0.9 million. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demand for the Company’s emergency products including the AHP300 ventilator.
International sales, which are included in the product lines discussed above, increased $3.4 million, or 39.1%, to $12.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to sales of $8.7 million in fiscal 2020.
Gross profit in fiscal 2021 was $7.1 million, or 19.6% of sales, compared to a gross profit of $5.6 million, or 17.6% of sales in fiscal 2020. The $1.5 million increase in gross profit is mainly attributable to a $4.4 million increase in sales.
The Company invested approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2021 and $0.8 million in fiscal 2020 for capital expenditures primarily for the expansion of the production line of our AHP300 ventilator.
Selling, General, and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for fiscal 2021 were $7.6 million compared to SG&A expenses of $8.6 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the $1.1 million provision in fiscal 2020 for environmental cleanup costs at the Company’s facility in Stuyvesant Falls, New York and a decrease of $0.2 million for business travel expenses in fiscal 2021. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase for legal and insurance expenses in fiscal 2021.
Interest income in fiscal 2021 was $233 compared to interest income of $654 in fiscal 2020. Interest expense in fiscal 2021 was $115,975 compared to interest expense of $64,682 in fiscal 2020.
Other income and expenses in fiscal 2021 include $2.4 million of income realized by the Company as a result of forgiveness of the PPP Loan.
The Company’s effective tax rate in 2021 was a provision of 4.1% compared to a benefit of 4.1% in 2020. The change in the effective tax rate in 2021 was attributable to non-deductible expenses attributable to the Company’s expected PPP Loan forgiveness and a decrease in the value of tax planning strategies.
The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been based on the reversal of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies and to the extent those items are not sufficient to support the value of recorded deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded. For the year ended June 30, 2019 the Company recorded an additional allowance of $536,240. For the year ended 2020 the Company recorded an additional allowance of $178,111 offset by an increase in the value of tax planning strategies of $138,873 resulting in a net increase in the allowance of $39,238. For the year ended 2021, the company recorded an additional allowance of $723,248. The allowance was further increased by a reduction in the value of the tax planning strategy of $63,676 resulting in a total increase to the allowance of $786,921. To the extent that the Company’s losses continue, the tax benefit of those losses would be fully offset by a valuation allowance.
Net income in fiscal 2021 was $1.7 million or $0.42 per basic and diluted earnings per share compared to a net loss of $3.0 million, or $0.75 per basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020. In 2021 and 2020 the weighted number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share was 4,013,537. In 2021 and 2020 the weighted number of shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 4,026,446 and 4,013,537, respectively.
Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019
The Company had a loss of $3.1 million before taxes for fiscal 2020, compared to a loss of $2.1 million before taxes for fiscal 2019. It recorded an income tax benefit of $130,359 in fiscal 2020, compared to an income tax provision of $29,448 in fiscal 2019.
Net sales for fiscal 2020 of $31.9 million were $0.5 million or 1.6% higher than net sales of $31.4 million in fiscal 2019. Domestically, sales decreased by $0.4 million dollars while international sales, which represented 27.5% of fiscal 2020 sales, were 11.7% higher. The decrease in domestic sales was largely attributable to declines in sales of construction products and respiratory therapy products. International business is dependent upon hospital construction projects, and the development of medical facilities and emergency services in those regions in which the Company operates, as well as the economic and political climates in those international markets.
Orders for the Company’s products for the year ended June 30, 2020 of $40.8 million were $9.3 million or 29.5% higher than orders for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $31.5 million. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced significantly increased orders for the emergency medical products sold by the Company, including the Company’s AHP300 ventilator and the EPV200 ventilator.
Respiratory care product sales, which include homecare products, were $8.6 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $9.0 million in 2019. Respiratory care products include carbon dioxide absorbents. For the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 the Company had carbon dioxide absorbent sales of Carbolime® and Litholyme® of $3.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
Medical gas equipment sales, which include construction products, of $15.3 million in fiscal 2020 were approximately $0.7 million, or 4.4% lower than prior year levels of $16.0 million. The decrease in domestic sales was largely attributable to declines in sales of construction products. The Company continues to evaluate and strengthen its sales strategy in this market.
Emergency medical product sales in fiscal 2020 of $8.1 million were $1.7 million or 26.6% higher than fiscal 2019 sales of $6.4 million. International sales of emergency medical products increased by 61.6% from the prior year while domestic sales increased by 13.2%. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demand for the Company’s emergency products including the AHP300 ventilator. Most of this increase occurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. While demand for emergency and mass-casualty ventilators increased in the last part of fiscal year 2020, it was necessary for the company to ramp up its manufacturing capacity and to address any supply chain issues. The ramp up has included investment in capital equipment and training to increase capacity. For these reasons some orders were not shipped immediately in the fourth quarter.
International sales, which are included in the product lines discussed above, increased $0.9 million, or 11.5%, to $8.7 million in fiscal 2020 compared to sales of $7.8 million in fiscal 2019.
Gross profit in fiscal 2020 was $5.6 million, or 17.6% of sales, compared to a gross profit of $5.0 million, or 15.9% of sales in fiscal 2019. The $0.6 million increase in gross profit is mainly attributable to a $0.7 million decrease in fringe benefits including medical benefits. The Company is self-insured for medical benefits and there is variation in the amount of claims over time.
The Company invested approximately $0.8 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 primarily for the expansion of the production line of our AHP300 ventilator. The Company did not invest in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019.
Selling, General, and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for fiscal 2020 were $8.6 million compared to SG&A expenses of $7.8 million in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to the $1.1 million provision for environmental cleanup costs at the Company’s facility in Stuyvesant Falls, New York. This increase was offset by a $0.3 million decrease in personnel cost consisting of salary and fringe benefits.
Interest income in fiscal 2020 was $654 compared to interest income of $138 in fiscal 2019. Interest expense in fiscal 2020 was $64,682 compared to interest expense of $56,223 in fiscal 2019.
Other income and expenses in fiscal 2019 include $750,000 of income realized by the Company as a result of the settlement of litigation with Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation d/b/a National Grid (“Niagara”), which provides electrical power to the Company’s facility in Stuyvesant Falls, New York, and one other party. See Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, below, for more information concerning litigation.
The Company’s effective tax rate in 2020 was a benefit of 4.1% compared to a provision of 1.4% in 2019. The change in the effective tax rate in 2020 was attributable to non-deductible expenses attributable to the Company’s expected PPP Loan forgiveness and an increase in the value of tax planning strategies.
The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been based on the reversal of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies and to the extent those items are not sufficient to support the value of recorded deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded. For the year ended June 30, 2018 the Company recorded a $352,727 reduction to the allowance. The reduction was caused by a decrease in the allowance of $1,080,362 due to a reduction in federal rates expected to be in effect at reversal. The reduced rates are as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This reduction was offset by a $727,635 increase in the valuation allowance reflecting the impact of 2018 additions to deferred tax assets not supported by deferred tax liabilities or tax planning strategies. For the year ended June 30, 2019 the Company recorded an additional allowance of $536,240. For the year ended 2020 the Company recorded an additional allowance of $178,111 offset by an increase in the value of tax planning strategies of $138,873 resulting in a net increase in the allowance of $39,238. To the extent that the Company’s losses continue, the tax benefit of those losses would be fully offset by a valuation allowance.
Net loss in fiscal 2020 was $3.0 million or $0.75 per basic and diluted earnings per share, an increase from a net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.53 per basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019. In 2020 and 2019 the weighted number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share was 4,013,537.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table sets forth selected information concerning Allied's financial condition at June 30:
The Company’s working capital was $6.3 million at June 30, 2021 compared to $5.9 million at June 30, 2020. The $0.4 million increase in working capital is from an inventory increase of $0.5 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $1.1 million and a decrease in customer deposits of $2.2 million. During fiscal 2021, these increases in working capital were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in cash and $1.0 million increase in the current portion of long term debt. Accounts receivable as measured in days sales outstanding (“DSO”) is 40 DSO at June 30, 2021, up from 35 DSO at June 30, 2020. The Company does adjust product forecast, order quantities, and safety stock based on changes in demand patterns in order to manage inventory levels.
The net decrease in cash for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was $1.9 million. The net increase in cash for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was $2.4 million. Cash flows used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 consisted of a decrease in Customer deposits of $2.2 million, a decrease of Accounts payable of $1.1 million and increase of Inventory of $0.5 million. These cash out flows were offset by a decrease of Accounts receivable of $0.2 million and net income of $1.7 million, supplemented by $0.6 million in non-cash charges for amortization and depreciation.
Cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 consisted of an increase in Customer deposits of $2.3 million, an increase of Accounts payable of $1.3 million and increase of Other accrued liabilities of $1.1 million. These cash flows were offset by an increase of Inventories of $1.6 million and a net loss of $3.1 million, supplemented by $0.6 million in non-cash charges for amortization and depreciation.
North Mill Loan Agreement
As of June 30, 2021, the Company was party to a Loan and Security Agreement with North Mill Capital, LLC (“North Mill”), as successor in interest to Summit Financial Resources, L.P., dated effective February 27, 2017, as amended April 16, 2018, April 24, 2019 and December 18, 2020 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company obtained a secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by all of the Company’s personal property, both tangible and intangible, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Availability of funds under the Credit Agreement is based on the Company’s accounts receivable and inventory but will not exceed $4,000,000. At June 30, 2021 availability under the agreement was approximately $630,000.
The Credit Facility will be available, subject to its terms, on a revolving basis until it expires on February 27, 2023, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will be due and payable. Advances will bear interest at a rate equal to 2.00% in excess of the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal. Interest is computed based on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. In addition to interest, the Credit facility requires that the Company pay the lender a monthly administration fee in an amount equal to forty-seven hundredths percent (0.47%) of the average outstanding daily principal amount of loan advances for each calendar month, or portion thereof.
Regardless of the amount borrowed under the Credit Facility, the Company will pay a minimum amount of .25% (25 basis points) per month on the maximum availability ($10,000 per month). In the event the Company prepays or terminates the Credit Facility prior to February 27, 2022, the Company will be obligated to pay an amount equal to the minimum monthly payment multiplied by the number of months remaining between February 27, 2022 and the date of such prepayment or termination.
Under the Credit Agreement, advances are generally subject to customary borrowing conditions and to North Mill’s sole discretion to fund the advances. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants with which the Company must comply during the term of the Credit Facility. Among other things, such covenants require the Company to maintain insurance on the collateral, operate in the ordinary course and not engage in a change of control, dissolve or wind up the Company.
The Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default including, without limitation: the failure to make payments when due; the material breach of representations or warranties contained in the Credit Agreement or other loan documents; cross-default with other indebtedness of the Company; the entry of judgments or fines that may have a material adverse effect on the Company; failure to comply with the observance or performance of covenants contained in the Credit Agreement or other loan documents; insolvency of the Company, appointment of a receiver, commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings; dissolution of the Company; the attachment of any state or federal tax lien; attachment or levy upon or seizure of the Company’s property; or any change in the Company’s condition that may have a material adverse effect. After an event of default, and upon the continuation thereof, the principal amount of all loans made under the Credit Facility would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 20.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate (provided, that the interest rate may not exceed the highest rate permissible under law), and North Mill would have the option to accelerate maturity and payment of the Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility.
The Company was in compliance with all of the covenants associated with the Credit Facility at June 30, 2021.
PPP Loan
On April 13, 2020, the Company entered into a Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loan agreement (the “SBA Loan”) with Jefferson Bank and Trust Company under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The Company received total proceeds of $2.375 million from the SBA Loan. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Company used proceeds from the SBA Loan for payroll costs and other permitted uses. The SBA Loan was scheduled to mature on April 13, 2022 and had a 1.00% interest rate and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act.
The loan, including all principal and accrued interest, was forgiven on June 11, 2021.
At June 30, 2021 the Company had $2.1 million indebtedness, including capital lease obligations, short-term debt, and long term debt.
The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations at June 30, 2021:
Capital expenditures were approximately $167,000, $758,000, and $0 in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to finance fixed payments and planned capital expenditures of $0.1 million in 2022.
At June 30, 2021, the Company had $2.1 million outstanding debt. During fiscal 2021 the Company had $36.7 million in borrowings and $34.6 million in repayments under the Credit Agreement. Cash used in operations was $3,784,000 in fiscal 2021. Cash flows from operations in fiscal 2020 and 2019 were $648,000 and $59,000, respectively. Our cash flows may be further negatively impacted by decreases in sales, market conditions, and adverse changes in working capital. While we believe that our borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement provides sufficient financial flexibility, continued negative cash flows could negatively affect our ability to access the Credit Agreement or to repay amounts borrowed and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us.
In fiscal 2021 the Company had borrowings of $36.7 million and repayments of $34.6 million under the Credit Agreement. In fiscal 2020 the Company had borrowings and repayments of $32.9 million under the Credit Agreement.
In 2021, inflation in the price of raw materials and purchased components negatively impacted earnings by approximately $0.5 million dollars. The Company experienced a material direct impact of $35,000 in 2021, and $44,000 in 2020, from changes in trade policy or tariffs. The Company also believes a portion of its increased raw materials costs were due to tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum import. The Company makes its foreign sales in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, sales proceeds are not affected by exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in exchange rates can affect the price of our products in local currency, which does impact the pace of incoming orders.
Quarterly Results
The following table sets forth selected operating results for the eight quarters ended June 30, 2021. The information for each of these quarters is unaudited, but includes all normal recurring adjustments which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof. These operating results, however, are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Further, operating results may fluctuate as a result of the timing of orders, the Company’s product and customer mix, the introduction of new products by the Company and its competitors, and overall trends in the health care industry and the economy. While these patterns have an impact on the Company’s quarterly operations, the Company is unable to predict the extent of this impact in any particular period.
Dollars in thousands, except per share data
Earnings per share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly amounts will not necessarily equal the total for the year.
Litigation and Contingencies
The Company becomes, from time to time, a party to personal injury litigation arising out of incidents involving the use of its products. The Company believes that any potential judgments resulting from such claims over its self-insured retention will be covered by the Company’s product liability insurance.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Item 8, Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Company’s financial statements, if any.
