Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report.
Our consolidated audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Our Current Business
Global Technologies Inc. is currently in the development stage. The Company’s business plan is to operate a fiber rejuvenation technology company. It plans on offering branded fabrics, apparel and uniforms to the corporate, hotel, hospital and military markets. We will achieve this by utilizing a patented and proprietary process for rejuvenating textile waste into high quality fabrics and apparel.
Plan of Operations and Cash Requirements
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are included herein.
The following summary of our results of operations, for the year ended December 31, 2020, should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, as included in this Form 10-K.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we recognized revenue of $3,994 and $3,758, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $227,726 in general and administrative expenses, $700 in stock-based compensation, $779,668 in other expense in a net loss of $1,135,868.

The decrease in net loss during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was mainly attributed to the decrease in consulting fees, marketing cost, professional fees, stock based compensation from stock options, loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities, amortization of debt discount from convertible notes and interest expenses incurred from the convertible notes during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Contractual Obligations
As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $33,821,292 and $32,685,425 as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, which include net losses of $1,135,868 and $1,662,123 for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,070,635 and $3,198,598 respectively, with limited cash resources available. Consequently, the aforementioned items raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to raise additional debt or equity and continue to settle obligations by issuing stock. Management plans to continue to raise additional debt and equity until the Company has positive cash flows from an operating company.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to repay or settle its current indebtedness, generate positive cash flow from an operating company, and/or raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on desirable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are required or if the funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, management may be required to restructure the Company or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared, and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial statements. Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as included in this Annual Report, for disclosures regarding the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of common stock and options issued as stock based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.
Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Leases
Effective October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $62,356 of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $62,356 of lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Stock-based Compensation
We account for stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation over the service-period that they are expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time, of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred $700 and $83,574 for stock based compensation, respectively.
Fair Value
FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”) establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level 1-Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs;
Level 2-Significant other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data; and
Level 3-Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.
The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and determined that the convertible notes should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance resulting in there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options. The Company accounts for convertible notes and warrants as a derivative liabilities due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of all conversion options.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options”. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial statements.
